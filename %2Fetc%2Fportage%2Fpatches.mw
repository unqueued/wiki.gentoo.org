User patches provide a way for users to apply patches to [[ebuild]]s. This is useful for the rare cases of site-specific patches, but also for applying upstream patches to unresolved bugs or testing patches before sending them to upstream or to the Gentoo bug tracker. The feature is provided by many ebuilds. 

Since EAPI=6, the default src_prepare as e.g. [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/x11-wm/lumina/lumina-1.2.0.ebuild#n45 in line 46 here] calls [https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/eapi/#eapi=6 <code>eapply_user</code>]. Prior to EAPI=6, either by calling <code>epatch_user</code> explicitly or by inheriting an eclass and relying on its default implementation of <code>src_prepare</code>. Current Gentoo policy does not require ebuilds to use <code>epatch_user</code>. In EAPIs before EAPI=6, its usage is at the package maintainer's discretion. But there is also a way [[#Enabling /etc/portage/patches for all ebuilds|to enable it for all ebuilds]] that don't explicitly allow user patching.

== Adding user patches ==

First choose the location for the patches, depending on the package name and the version(s) it is intended for. Use the following locations and optionally append <code>:${SLOT}</code> to any of them:

* {{Path|/etc/portage/patches/${CATEGORY}/${P} }}
* {{Path|/etc/portage/patches/${CATEGORY}/${PN} }}
* {{Path|/etc/portage/patches/${CATEGORY}/${P}-${PR} }}

Examples:

* {{Path|/etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/python}}
* {{Path|/etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/python:3.4}}
* {{Path|/etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/python-3.4.2}}
* {{Path|/etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/python-3.3.5-r1}}

=== Example ===

The next example shows a very simple patch for {{bug|593604}} of {{package|sys-fs/udev-init-scripts}}. 

The package that needs a patch will be unpacked using the {{c|ebuild}} command:

{{Cmd|ebuild $(portageq get_repo_path / gentoo)/sys-fs/udev-init-scripts/udev-init-scripts-27.ebuild unpack|output=<pre>
 * udev-init-scripts-27.tar.bz2 SHA256 SHA512 WHIRLPOOL size ;-) ...                                                                              [ ok ]
 * checking ebuild checksums ;-) ...                                                                                                              [ ok ]
 * checking miscfile checksums ;-) ...                                                                                                            [ ok ]
>>> Unpacking source...
>>> Unpacking udev-init-scripts-27.tar.bz2 to /var/tmp/portage/sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-27/work
>>> Source unpacked in /var/tmp/portage/sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-27/work
</pre>}}

Any {{c|diff}} for the user patch needs to refer to the just created directory, so cd into it:

{{Cmd|cd /var/tmp/portage/sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-27/work/
|tree|output=<pre>
└── udev-init-scripts-27
    ├── Makefile
    ├── README
    ├── conf.d
    │   └── udev
    └── init.d
        └── udev
</pre>}}

Say {{path|init.d/udev}} were the file to be changed. So it should be copied to {{path|/tmp}} (or somwere else):

{{Cmd|cp init.d/udev /tmp/}}

Make the modifications to the copy:

{{Cmd|${EDITOR} /tmp/udev}}

After having modified the copy, check the {{c|diff}}:

{{Cmd|cd /var/tmp/portage/sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-27/work/
|diff -u udev-init-scripts-27/init.d/udev /tmp/udev|output=<pre>
--- udev-init-scripts-27/init.d/udev 2014-08-08 18:14:52.000000000 +0200

-#!/sbin/runscript
+#!/sbin/openrc-run
 # Copyright 1999-2013 Gentoo Foundation

</pre>}}

Of course, still the directory for the patch needs to be created:

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /etc/portage/patches/sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-27}}

Now the directory is ready drop in the patches. Only files with {{Path|.patch}} suffix are considered and they are applied in the order determined by their name.

Repeat the {{c|diff}} and create the patch file:

{{RootCmd|cd /var/tmp/portage/sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-27/work/
|diff -u udev-init-scripts-27/init.d/udev /tmp/udev > /etc/portage/patches/sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-27/somefunnyname.patch}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/patches/sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-27/somefunnyname.patch|lang=diff|1=

It is imporant that the first line of the {{path|.patch}} file refers to the [https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/variables/ S directory] created by unpacking.

Note that <code>epatch_user</code> attempts to apply them repeatedly with a prefix stripped up to a different number of slashes.
However, <code>eapply_user</code> used in EAPI=6 defaults to using the -p1 depth for patches.  So to satisfy both, it is recommended to use the -p1 depth format where the first directory listed is ignored.

Once the patch gets merged to the [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/log ebuild repository], do not forget to remove it from the {{path|/etc/portage/patches}} directory.  Otherwise next time compiling the ebuild might fail.

== Using a git directory as a source of patches ==

Instead of creating the directory, a symlink can be created to a git directory on the system.

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /etc/portage/patches/sys-libs && ln -s /home/user/projects/glibc /etc/portage/patches/sys-libs/glibc}}

{{Note| When using <code>userpriv</code> as a <var>[[FEATURES]]</var> value in Portage (eg. in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}), Portage drops root privileges to <code>portage:portage</code> which means that the folder that the symlink points to must be accessible by the user or group ''portage'' otherwise the patches will be silently ignored and not applied (file {{Path|epatch_user.log}} contains the string ''none''); 
ie. in this case, all the folders of {{Path|/home/user/projects/glibc}} are already accessible due to <code>o+rx</code> permissions but in the case of root and using this path {{Path|/root/projects/glibc}} then {{Path|/root}}, unlike {{Path|/home}}, is inaccessible due to <code>u+rx</code> permissions...}}

Now, in the git directory, perform the usual work. After finishing remove all patches from the previous run and use <tt>git format-patch</tt> to create a patchset from the branch based on another known branch.

{{Cmd|rm -f *.patch && git format-patch origin/master}}

This solution relies on the fact that only files ending with {{Path|.patch}} are processed in the patch directory.

== Enabling /etc/portage/patches for all ebuilds ==

If an ebuild does not call <code>epatch_user</code>, but user patches are still needed to be applied, it is possible to use [[_/etc/portage/bashrc|/etc/portage/bashrc]] and hooks provided by [[Portage]]. Candidates are <code>post_src_unpack</code>, <code>pre_src_prepare</code> or <code>post_src_prepare</code>. The first two have the advantage of being run before <code>eautoreconf</code> (or similar) and the last two have the advantage of being run in the right directory, so only <code>pre_src_prepare</code> shares those advantages.

Normally only ebuilds inheriting <code>eutils</code> can access <code>epatch_user</code>, so one would need to test for its presence and non-eutils ebuilds would not get patched at all. There is a trick of pulling in only the necessary bits from {{Path|eutils.eclass}}, running <code>epatch_user</code> and dropping them.

With <code>pre_src_prepare</code> and the above trick, changing directories do not need to be played with, all ebuilds can be supported whether they import <code>eutils</code> or not, and the patches will applied as soon as possible in the chain. While it might still be better to have this feature as part of Portage, the following snippet should cover everyday needs pretty well.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/bashrc|lang=bash|1=
pre_src_prepare() {
    [[ ${EAPI:-0} {{=}}{{=}} [012345] ]] {{!}}{{!}} return
    if ! type estack_push > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        local estack_names{{=}}"eshopts_push eshopts_pop evar_push evar_push_set evar_pop estack_push estack_pop"
        source <(awk "/^# @(FUNCTION{{!}}VARIABLE): / { p {{=}} 0 } /^# @(FUNCTION{{!}}VARIABLE): (${estack_names// /{{!}}})\$/ { p {{=}} 1 } p { print }" ${PORTDIR}/eclass/estack.eclass)
    fi
    if ! type epatch_user > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        local epatch_names{{=}}"EPATCH_SOURCE EPATCH_USER_SOURCE epatch_user_death_notice epatch_user epatch"
        source <(awk "/^# @(FUNCTION{{!}}VARIABLE): / { p {{=}} 0 } /^# @(FUNCTION{{!}}VARIABLE): (${epatch_names// /{{!}}})\$/ { p {{=}} 1 } p { print }" ${PORTDIR}/eclass/epatch.eclass)
    fi

    epatch_user

    for name in $epatch_names; do
        unset $name
    done
    for name in $estack_names; do
        unset $name
    done

}
}}
