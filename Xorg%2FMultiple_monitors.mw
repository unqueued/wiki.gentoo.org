This page describes the setup of multiple monitors under 
Xorg. Multihead-support in X has luckily progressed in recent
versions, so it's pretty easy to set up. It's as simple as defining
monitors.

== Basic setup ==

The basic procedure is defining one "Monitor" section per Monitor and
then tying everything together in a "Device" section specifying the
video chip driving the monitors. For the following examples we assume,
that the Xorg configuration is stored in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d' and
there is no `/etc/X11/xorg.conf' (alternatively all files in
xorg.conf.d can be combined to form an xorg.conf). We create one file
per monitor. The following example is the basic version for two
monitors of the same resolution.

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/41-dvi-monitor.conf||<pre>
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier  "DVI"
EndSection
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/42-hdmi-monitor.conf||<pre>
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier  "DP"
    Option      "LeftOf"        "DVI"
EndSection
</pre>}}

Each "Monitor" section needs to contain an Identifier, everything else
is optional. The identifier may be freely chosen. The placement of the
monitors is done relatively with one of the keywords RightOf, LeftOf,
Above or Below. (Additionally there is Relative keyword for fancy
cases.) Each monitor can recieve custom options (e.g. resolution) in
its configuration.

Now we need to map the monitors to the actual outputs. This is done in
the "Device" section describing the video chip and driver. In our
example this would look like the following.

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-video.conf||<pre>
Section "Device"
    Option      "Monitor-DVI2" "DVI"
    Option      "Monitor-DP1" "DP"
    Driver      "intel"
EndSection
</pre>}}

{{Important|The driver has to be your video card driver. Common
options are for example intel, radeon or nouveau.}}

Here the names are of the form "Monitor-<port>" were port is the name
listed in "xrandr -q". This should be everything you need for the
basic setup.

== More complex cases ==

First a more complete third example of a monitor file, with resolution
options. Here you see, that one can also use the manufacturer names to
get a single config file attached to a single device.

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/43-lvds-monitor.conf||<pre>
Section "Monitor"
    Modeline    "1280x800x60" 71.00 1280 1328 1360 1440 800 803 809 823
    Option      "PreferredMode" "1280x800"
    Identifier  "LVDS"
    Option      "RightOf"       "DVI"
    VendorName  "CMO"
EndSection
</pre>}}

First a more complete example of the video configuration for
{{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel}}.

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-video.conf||<pre>
Section "Device"
    Option      "Monitor-DVI2" "DVI"
    Option      "Monitor-DP1" "DP"
    Option      "Monitor-LVDS2" "LVDS"
    Option      "AccelMethod" "sna"
    Option      "TearFree" "true"
    Option      "DRI" "True"
    Option      "XvMCSurfaces" "6"
    Identifier  "GMA-X4500"
    Driver      "intel"
EndSection
</pre>}}

The following was made for {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati}} for
radeon driver. Notice the change of the video output name on the same
laptop.

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-video.conf||<pre>
Section "Device"
    Option      "Monitor-DVI-0" "DVI"
    Option      "Monitor-HDMI-0" "DP"
    Option      "Monitor-LVDS" "LVDS"
    Option      "AccelMethod" "EXA"
    Option      "ClockGating" "On"
    Option      "ForceLowPowerMode" "On"
    Option      "VGAAccess" "On"
    Identifier  "HD3450"
    Driver      "radeon"
    Option      "MonitorLayout" "LVDS, AUTO"
EndSection
</pre>}}

{{Note|If you are using {{Package|x11-drivers/ati-drivers}} then to
increase your Virtual in xorg.conf it must be an exact multiple of the
highest resolution monitor. For instance if your largest monitor is
1920x1080 then enter 3840 2160 for Virtual. This will enable xrandr to
work properly. This appears to be a bug.}}

== Different resolutions ==

{{Note|Actually [[Xrandr]]-1.3 is a little defficient in this regard
because actually X can probe pretty finely the screen
devices. However, xrandr will just get/display the minimum resolution
fitted to the smallest screen attached to the machine. This is really
annoying because one should have again and again go read Xorg.0.log to
get the possible resolutions, define a few modes with xrandr, and then
chose a video mode with xrandr. Nothing userfriendly... at
hand. That's matter of minutes, but still, annoying when one just want
to attach a bigger screen to a computer and watch a movie, for
example. The latter can be achieved, somewhat, with the following
guide.}}

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/44-vga-monitor.conf||<pre>
Section "Monitor"
    Option      "SyncOnGreen" "True"
    Modeline    "1280x1024x85" 157.50 1280 1344 1504 1728 1024 1025 1028 1072
    Modeline    "1600x1200x85" 229.50 1600 1664 1856 2160 1200 1201 1204 1250
    Modeline    "1600x1200x75" 202.50 1600 1664 1856 2160 1200 1201 1204 1250
    Option      "PreferredMode" "1600x1200"
    Identifier  "VGA"
    VendorName  "GSM"
EndSection
</pre>}}

{{Note|Actually anybody could notice the level of fine probping of X
server or rather {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev}} (?) whith
numerous handy details (numerous screen resolutions, gamma values and
other obscure values). One can pick any defined video mode on the list
and X server will pick it up. Fine. Now, whenever anybody would want
to change the video mode of a particular display... xrandr will
complain about inexistant modes. What? The video modes vanished
somewhere, well only remain the ones that can fit to the biggest
resolution that can fit to the smallest display (following?). So one
should copy/paste some prefered video modes like in the previous
fashion.}}
