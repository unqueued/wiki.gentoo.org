Looking a few weeks ago to a nice and fast wiki or ressource page to get started with X multihead without wanting to meddle in dozen of pages again ad again.

Well, nothing could be found quickly to satisfy a simple way to get multihead running every time a screen or a particular screen was attached to a computer. Well, some old X.org/Multihead found out there was really too old, written before the new [[xorg.conf]] file less adoption with {{Package|x11-base/xorg-server}}-1.10.0 (was it that version?).

Anyway, again, I had to find out how to do it alone without any single hint found in the intertubes. I was just impressed how the xorg.conf file less could be very efficientt at handling multi screens set up that are always, or not, attached to the computer.

How to get it working? Simple as defining monitors in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d'. One can use the manufacturer names to get a single config file attached to a single device. That's way, one can add custom settings like video modes etc.

The following is just a example. First there is no `/etc/X11/xorg.conf'. And then add the following files or rather a variation adapted to your set up to get going.

{{Note|Actually [[Xrandr]]-1.3 is a little defficient in this regard because actually X can probe pretty finely the screen devices. However, xrandr will just get/display the minimum resolution fitted to the smallest screen attached to the machine. This is really annoying because one should have again and again go read Xorg.0.log to get the possible resolutions, define a few modes with xrandr, and then chose a video mode with xrandr. Nothing userfriendly... at hand. That's matter of minutes, but still, annoying when one just want to attach a bigger screen to a computer and watch a movie, for example. The latter can be achieved, somewhat, with the following guide.}}

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/41-vga-monitor.conf||<pre>
Section "Monitor"
    Option      "SyncOnGreen" "True"
    Modeline    "1280x1024x85" 157.50 1280 1344 1504 1728 1024 1025 1028 1072

    Modeline    "1600x1200x75" 202.50 1600 1664 1856 2160 1200 1201 1204 1250
    Option      "PreferredMode" "1600x1200"

{{Note|Actually anybody could notice the level of fine probping of X server or rather {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev}} (?) whith numerous handy details (numerous screen resolutions, gamma values and other obscure values). One can pick any defined video mode on the list and X server with pick it up. Fine. Now, whenever anybody would want to change the video mode of a particular display... xrandr will complain about inexistant modes. What? The video modes vanished somewhere, well only remain the ones that can fit to the biggest resolution that can fit to the smallest display (following?). So one should copy/paste some prefered video modes like in the previous fashion.}}

{{Important|One should adapt the previous config file to its hardware. The previous goal was: a single config file for a single device. Yes, one should make one for every single device attached to the computer. That's far from being very user friendly but it is the only way to get the right resolution and video for every single device.}}

And finally, one do not need to define or include monitors sub section in the following screen section... That's because the effect of the previous defined monitors files will be used right away, thanks to evdev for the hot swap ability, whenever the refered monitor device will be attached to the computer.

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-screen.conf||<pre>

{{Important|The only remaining issue is :every single Xorg video driver will name differently each video output adapter. Again, one should handle this on her/his own...}}

{{Note|The prevous 50-screen.conf was done for {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel}}. The following was made for {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati}} for radeon driver. Notice the change of the video output name on the same laptop.}}
