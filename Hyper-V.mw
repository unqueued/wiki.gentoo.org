For X11 (graphical) support additional kernel options will be needed. If graphical support is desired through uvesafb, the {{Package|sys-apps/v86d}} package is necessary. It installs the user space tools for uvesa ({{Path|/sbin/v86d}}. Head over to the [[uvesafb|uvesafb article]] for instructions on how to satisfy the kernel and user space requirements of uvesafb. When finished, return here and continue reading.
