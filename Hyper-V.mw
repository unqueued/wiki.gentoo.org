Hyper-V is [[Article description::Microsoft's enterprise-class hypervisor.]]

Getting Hyper-V support into Gentoo requires two important steps: kernel support and user space graphic driver support. 

== Installation ==

This section shows the reader how to enable Gentoo to run as a guest on a Hyper-V hypervisor.

=== Kernel ===

==== Linux guest support ====

Getting the kernel configured to handle Hyper-V is not terribly complicated. Below is a summary of the kernel features that need to be available to run Gentoo under Hyper-V. The features names are subject to change, so be sure to search the kernel's menuconfig for features containing the string <code>HYPERY</code>.

For X11 (graphical) support additional kernel options will be needed. If graphical support is desired through uvesafb, the {{Package|sys-apps/v86d}} package is necessary. It installs the user space tools for uvesa ({{Path|/sbin/v86d}}). Head over to the [[uvesafb|uvesafb article]] for instructions on how to satisfy the kernel and user space requirements of uvesafb. When finished return here and continue reading.

== Removal ==

Removing the Hyper-V support is as simple as disabling the related kernel options (reverse the steps in the [[#Kernel|Kernel section]] above.
