Hyper-V is Microsoft's enterprise-class hypervisor. This article [[Article description::explains how to run Gentoo has a guest operating system on Microsoft's Hyper-V hypervisor.]]

Getting Hyper-V support into Gentoo requires two important steps: kernel support and user-space graphic driver support. 

== Installation ==

This section shows the reader how to enable Gentoo to run as a guest on a Hyper-V hypervisor.

=== Kernel ===

==== Linux guest support ====

Getting the kernel configured to handle Hyper-V is not terribly complicated. Below is a summary of the kernel features that need to be available to run Gentoo under Hyper-V. The features names are subject to change, so be sure to search the kernel's menuconfig for features containing the string <code>HYPERV</code>.

=== Graphics ===

For X11 (graphical) support the <var>CONFIG_FBDEV</var> kernel option is required:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable graphical support via fbdev|1=
Device Drivers  --->
   Graphics support  --->
      <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support)  --->
         [*]   Enable legacy fbdev support for your modesetting driver
}}

=== Emerge ===

If X server graphical support is desired through fbdev, be sure to adjust {{Path|make.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
VIDEO_CARDS="fbdev"
}}

Next (re)emerge xorg-drivers package:

{{Emerge|params+=--update --newuse --deep|x11-base/xorg-drivers}}

== Removal ==

Removing the Hyper-V support is as simple as disabling the related kernel options (reverse the steps in the [[#Kernel|Kernel section]] above.
