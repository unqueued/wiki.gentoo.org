|Redox Relibc Support|year=2019|
[https://www.redox-os.org/ Redox] is a brand new operating system written in [https://rust-lang.org rust], it provides a [https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc libc] implementation that works both on Linux and on the Redox kernel.

This project aims to be able to have a '''x86_64-unknown-linux-relibc''' stage3 produced and pave the way to have portage available to the Redox operating system itself.

Main Tasks:
* Prepare a ''relibc'' ebuild.
* Make sure a the base system could be built on top of it
** Check for errors when building the critical Gentoo toolchain utilities, e.g. building Python3 and Bash 
** Report any issues to both Gentoo and Redox
** Submit Merge Requests fixes/improvements upstream to Redox GitLab
* Make sure a viable stage3 could be built

Bonus Tasks:
* Have a gentoo-prefix running on Redox

In order to apply on top of the normal Gentoo requirement of fixing an open issue and/or send a pull request, it is required to propose a fix or an improvement on the [https://gitlab.redox-os.org/groups/redox-os/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Easy redox gitlab].
