{{GSoCIdea|year=2018|Standalone Gentoo Chromebook|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
The fact that Google Chromebooks are built by portage is an evidence of flexibility and power of portage. However, portage and other Gentoo tools are invisible to end-users because portage is only used to cross compile and build the filesystem image.  The resulting image does not have portage or toolchain, and becomes a feature-limited ChromeOS compared to a standard Gentoo system.  ChromiumOS, the community counterpart of ChromeOS, is an open operating system that is straightforward to build and hack.  In this project, we will make a full-featured Gentoo-like ChromiumOS combining the innovative Chromebook experience with flexibility of portage and software packages from Gentoo.
