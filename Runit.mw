'''runit''' is an init replacement with service monitoring. It can be used in conjunction with OpenRC as an alternative to sysvinit or even replacing OpenRC as service manager.

== Configuration ==

=== PID 1 &mdash; init replacement ===

runit can be used as the system init. To do this, simply add <code>init=/sbin/runit-init</code> to your bootloader's command line and reboot. You can leave sysvinit installed and go back to it at any time by reverting the change.

Out of the box, {{c|runit-init}} has a very minimal configuration which will only get you to a console login. Although it would be optimal to have all your daemons started up in a single consistent way, you're free to mix and match between runit and OpenRC as you like. Your initscripts can be found in the "default" runlevel, which can be started  automatically on boot with the existing "local" service:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/rc-default.start|title=Start up the default runlevel after boot|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
rc default}}
{{RootCmd|chmod u+x /etc/local.d/rc-default.start}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add local boot}}

Alternatively, you can add <code>RUNLEVEL=S /sbin/rc default</code> to {{Path|/etc/runit/1}}.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/runit/1|1=
...

RUNLEVEL=S /sbin/rc sysinit
RUNLEVEL=S /sbin/rc boot
RUNLEVEL=S /sbin/rc default

...
}}

Or, if you prefer to do it manually

{{RootCmd|rc default}}

==== Reboot and shutdown ====

Runit is not directly compatible with sysvinit's {{c|telinit}}, {{c|halt}}, {{c|poweroff}}, {{c|reboot}} and {{c|shutdown}} commands, however many programs (e.g. desktop environments) expect to be able to call some of these.

You can restore the functionality using some one-liner shell scripts:
{{FileBox|filename=$PATH/shutdown|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
runit-init 0
}}
{{FileBox|filename=$PATH/reboot|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
runit-init 6
}}

=== Init and Service manager ===

Runit can also replace OpenRC as the service manager. To achieve this, delete all lines starting with <code>RUNLEVEL=S</code> in {{Path|/etc/runit/1}}. However, you have to replace the initscripts with your own scripts (or you can [https://github.com/powerman/powerman-overlay use an overlay]) that do the same tasks (to see what tasks are being executed by OpenRC, one could run <code>rc-status sysinit</code> and <code>rc-status boot</code>). 

=== OpenRC Supervision Service ===

Runit can supervise processes without running as init, or even necessarily as root:

{{Cmd|mkdir /path/to/service-dir/}}
{{GenericCmd|(Create your service directories and run scripts here, using the same layout as /etc/runit/runsvdir/all/)}}
{{Cmd|chmod a+x /path/to/service-dir/*/run}}

==== Local service ====

OpenRC can start this for you using {{Path|/etc/init.d/local}} (see {{Path|/etc/local.d/README}} for more details):

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/runsvdir.start|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
# Remember to add --user if you don't want to run as root!
start-stop-daemon --start --background --make-pidfile \
    --pidfile /run/runsvdir.pid \
    --exec /usr/bin/runsvdir -- /path/to/service-dir/
}}
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/runsvdir.stop|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile /run/runsvdir.pid
}}

==== OpenRC service ====

This does the same as the {{Path|local.d}} script above, but using OpenRC proper. As such, you can use the extra features it provides like initscript multiplexing.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/init.d/runsvdir|lang=bash|1=
#!/sbin/openrc-run
command="runsvdir"
command_args="/etc/service"
pidfile="/run/${SVCNAME}.pid"
command_background="true"
description="starts and monitors a collection of runsv(8) processes"
retry="SIGHUP/5"

depend() {
    need localmount
}
}}
