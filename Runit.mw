'''runit''' is an init replacement with service monitoring.

=== Post-Install Configuration ===

Runit can be used as the system init. To do this, simply add <tt>init=/sbin/runit-init</tt> to your bootloader's command line and reboot. You can leave sysvinit installed and go back to it at any time by reverting the change.

Out of the box, runit-init has a very minimal configuration which will only get you to a console login. All of your configured OpenRC services are still accessible though, and they can be automatically started on boot with a simple edit:

{{File|/etc/runit/1|Example runit startup script|<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# system one time tasks

PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin

RUNLEVEL=S /sbin/rc sysinit
RUNLEVEL=S /sbin/rc boot
rc default                  # <-- Add this line

touch /etc/runit/stopit
chmod 0 /etc/runit/stopit
</pre>}}
(If you're making the above change after the first reboot, there's no need to reboot twice for it to take effect - just run "rc default" manually.)

Runit isn't directly compatible with sysvinit's "telinit", "halt", "poweroff", "reboot" and "shutdown" commands, however, it's possible to emulate the interface they use [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7610342.html#7610342 with a simple script].
