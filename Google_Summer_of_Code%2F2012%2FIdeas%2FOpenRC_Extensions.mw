|OpenRC Extensions|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 

OpenRC is the default init system in Gentoo, it provides a large deal of features while staying mostly agnostic to
the underlying implementation on /sbin/init.

The project aims to be a constructive criticism to the systemd approach by providing the few interesting features
not already implemented by OpenRC as stand alone modules allowing integrator not to need to bend their system layouts to accomodate the init system.
