This article describes the setup of [[power management]] for [[:Category:Processors|processors]].

== CPU frequency scaling ==

CPU frequency scaling is a technique whereby the frequency of a processor can be automatically adjusted "on the fly"  to conserve power and to reduce the amount of heat generated by the chip.

=== Установка ===

==== BIOS ====

Some functions can be enabled or disabled in the [[BIOS]]. Check that the following are enabled:
* "Processor C1E support"
* "Enhanced Speedstep (EIST)"

==== Ядро ====

Activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling CPU power management options|1=
Power management and ACPI options  --->
     [*] ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support  --->
         <*>   Processor
     CPU Frequency scaling  --->
         [*] CPU Frequency scaling
             Default CPUFreq governor (ondemand)  --->
                 Select a default governor; see below table
                 Default is:
                 ondemand
             x86 CPU frequency scaling drivers  --->
                 Select a driver, see below table
}}

A governor is needed, which is responsible for changing the frequency based on its profile:

{| class="table"
|+ Default CPUFreq governor
|-
! Option
! Module
! Supported Processors
! Note
|-
| 'performance' governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_performance}}
| Sets the frequency statically to the highest available CPU frequency.
|
|-
| 'powersave' governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_powersave}}
| Sets the frequency statically to the lowest available CPU frequency.
| Can't be set as default governor
|-
| 'userspace' governor for userspace frequency scaling
| {{ta|cpufreq_userspace}}
| To set the CPU frequency manually or when a userspace program shall be able to set the CPU dynamically.
|
|-
| 'ondemand' cpufreq policy governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_ondemand}} 
| Does a periodic polling and changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.
| recommend
|-
| 'conservative' cpufreq governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_conservative}}
| Similar to ondemand. The frequency is gracefully increased and decreased rather than jumping to 100% when speed is required.
|

{| class="table"
|+ x86 CPU frequency scaling drivers
|-
! Option
! Module
! Supported Processors
! Note
|-
| Processor Clocking Control interface driver
| {{ta|pcc-cpufreq}}
|
|
|-
| ACPI Processor P-States driver
| {{ta|acpi-cpufreq}}
| Intel Core, [[Intel Core 2]], Intel Atom, Intel Pentium M
|
|-
| AMD Opteron/Athlon64 PowerNow!
| {{ta|powernow-k8}}
| AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon 64, AMD Turion 64
|
|-
| Intel Enhanced SpeedStep (deprecated)
| {{ta|speedstep_centrino}}
| Intel Pentium M (Centrino), Intel Xeon
| Deprecate, use '''ACPI Processor P-States driver''' instead.
|-
| Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation
| {{ta|p4-clockmod}}
| Intel Pentium 4, Intel XEON
| Causes severe slowdowns and noticeable latencies
|}

== Ticks ==

The processor saves the most energy when the processor stays longer in power savings mode, so reduce the amount of ticks that wakes the processor up.

=== Installation ===

==== BIOS ====

Some functions can be enabled or disabled in the [[BIOS]]. Check that the following are enabled:
* "HPET"
* "Multimedia timer"

==== Kernel ====

Activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling tick optimizing functions in the kernel|1=
Processor type and features  --->
   [*] Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks)
   [*] High Resolution Timer Support
   [*] HPET Timer Support
}}

{{Note|These options now appear to be under "General setup" -> "Timers subsystem".}}

== PowerTOP ==

[[PowerTOP]] is a utility designed to measure, explain and minimize a computer's electrical power consumption.

=== Installation ===

====  Kernel ====

Please refer to the [[PowerTOP#Kernel|Kernel section]] in the [[PowerTOP]] article for more information.

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling powertop functions|1=
Power management and ACPI options  --->
   [*] Power Management Debug Support
   [*]   Extra PM attributes in sysfs for low-level debugging/testing
Kernel hacking  --->
   [*] Kernel debugging
   [*] Collect kernel timers statistics
}}

==== Software ====

Install {{Package|sys-power/powertop}}:

{{USEflag
|unicode+yes
|X
}}

{{Emerge|sys-power/powertop}}

{{Important|For kernel 3.3 onwards, one will need to enable the following kernel options (maybe incomplete list) to get proper support. Some of the following config are already enabled in the previous graphical kernel configuration. One can use the following to quickly check if the required options are set or not. The last two options are not mandatory.}}
{{FileBox|filename=/usr/src/linux/.config|1=
CONFIG_NO_HZ
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS
CONFIG_HPET_TIMER
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND
CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE
CONFIG_TIMER_STATS
CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS
CONFIG_PERF_COUNTERS
CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS
CONFIG_TRACING
# These do not seem to be mandatory:
CONFIG_EVENT_POWER_TRACING_DEPRECATED
CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS_POWER}}

==== Usage ====

When [[PowerTOP|powertop]] is ran, it sorts the running processes in order of how often they cause the processor to wake up.

== Hprofile ==

It is possible to change the active CPU governer using a simple command:

{{RootCmd|for c in $(ls -d /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*); do
echo ondemand >$c/cpufreq/scaling_governor; done}}

Read {{Path|/etc/local.d/README}} to learn how to execute this command on startup.

Applications such as {{Package|sys-power/cpupower}} do little more than the above but with some interface on top of it. However, having to run certain commands as root depending on the system usage is not efficient for most users. It is better to automate some of the decisions of governing CPU frequency. For instance, when not wired to AC power, most users would like to have the system in a power saving mode.

This is where [[Hprofile]] comes into play. Please refer to its article for more information and configuration.
