gold is a new linker intended as a replacement for the ''ld.bfd'' linker.

The two installed linkers are available directly as ''ld.bfd'' and ''ld.gold'' respectively. Additionally, the default linker is also installed as ''ld'' -- and this binary is used by compilers.

== Switching the default linker ==
The default linker can be changed immediately by linking ld to ld.gold in the binutils directory.

{{Cmd|readlink -f /usr/bin/ld
|output=/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/binutils-bin/2.22/ld}}

Hard link:
{{RootCmd|ln -f /usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/binutils-bin/2.22/ld.gold /usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/binutils-bin/2.22/ld}}

Symbolic link:
{{RootCmd|ln -sf ld.gold /usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/binutils-bin/2.22/ld}}

To make the change persistent across re-installations of binutils, one should pass a flag to the binutils configure script. This can be done using the EXTRA_ECONF variable in a [[package.env]] configuration.

{{File|/etc/portage/env/gold.conf|Environment overrides to enable gold by default|<pre>
EXTRA_ECONF="--enable-gold=default"
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/portage/package.env|Enabling ''gold.conf'' override for binutils|<pre>
sys-devel/binutils gold.conf
</pre>}}
