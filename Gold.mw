gold is a new linker intended as a replacement for the ''ld.bfd'' linker.

The two installed linkers are available directly as ''ld.bfd'' and ''ld.gold'' respectively. Additionally, the default compiler is also installed as ''ld'' -- and this binary is used by compilers.

The default compiler can be changed either by changing the build arguments as pointed out above and rebuilding binutils, or through replacing the ''ld'' executable. In order to do that, first locate the actual binutils install directory:

{{RootCmd|readlink -f /usr/bin/ld|output=/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/binutils-bin/2.22/ld.gold}}

Now replace ''ld'' in that directory by the symlink of choice:

{{RootCmd|ln -s -f ld.gold /usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/binutils-bin/2.22/ld}}

Note that for the first argument, path relative to the final directory should be used -- so it should either state ''ld.gold'' or ''ld.bfd''.
