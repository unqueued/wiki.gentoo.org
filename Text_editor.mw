You find more editors in the "app-editors" and "x11-terms" categories.

== Set default ==
You can set system wide the default editor in the {{Path|/etc/env.d/99editor}}, e.g. switch to Vim:
{{File|/etc/env.d/99editor||<pre>
EDITOR="/usr/bin/vim"
</pre>}}

Each user can also set his default editor with eselect (replace ''NUMBER'' with the wanted number):
{{Cmd|eselect editor list
|eselect editor set NUMBER}}

Actually eselect modifies the file above. The old method of changing in rc.conf seems don't work any more.
