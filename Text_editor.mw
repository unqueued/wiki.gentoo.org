A '''text editor''' is a program to create and edit of text files. Although it is not impossible to edit files without using one, text editors make it easy to edit configuration files.

More text editor options can be found online in the [https://packages.gentoo.org/category/app-editors app-editors] category or by running:

{{Cmd|eix "app-editors/*"}}

=== Vim and Vi ===

If [[Vim]] is installed the {{c|vi}} and {{c|vim}} commands become synonymous due to the following link:
{{Cmd|ls -al /usr/bin/vi|output=<pre>
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 Nov 25 19:59 /usr/bin/vi -> vim</pre>}}

The synonymous use also holds for setting editor defaults.

=== Sudo editor ===

[[sudo]] does not preserve the user's environment variables and therefore may have a different default editor.

=== Visudo editor ===

Due to the sensitive nature of {{Path|/etc/sudoers}} it may only edited via the {{c|visudo}} command which in turn is limited to a predefined selection of editors. Type {{c|man visudo}} for more information.

== Setting system default ==

The system wide default text editor can be defined in the {{Path|/etc/env.d/99editor}} file. To change the Gentoo system default from nano to Vim add the path to Vim's executable:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/env.d/99editor|title=Changing system wide text editor default|lang=bash|1=
EDITOR="/usr/bin/vim"
}}

The system default editor can also be set with the {{c|eselect}} utility. Replace <code><NUMBER></code> in the following command with a number corresponding to the text editor of choice:

{{RootCmd|eselect editor list|output=<pre>
Available targets for the EDITOR variable:
  [1]   /bin/nano
  [2]   /bin/ed
  [3]   /usr/bin/emacs
  [4]   /usr/bin/ex
  [5]   /usr/bin/vi
  [ ]   (free form)
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|eselect editor set <NUMBER>}}

Actually eselect modifies the file above. It seems that the old method of editing {{Path|rc.conf}} doesn't work any more.
