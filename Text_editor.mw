You find more editors in the "[http://packages.gentoo.org/category/app-editors app-editors]" category.

== vim and vi ==
If [[Vim]] is installed, you may treat <tt>vi</tt> and <tt>vim</tt> synonymous due to the following link.
{{Cmd|ls -al /usr/bin/vi|output=<pre>
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 Nov 25 19:59 /usr/bin/vi -> vim</pre>}}
The synonymous use also holds for setting editor defaults.

== Set default ==
You can set system wide the default editor in the {{Path|/etc/env.d/99editor}}, e.g. switch to Vim:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/env.d/99editor|lang=bash|1=
EDITOR="/usr/bin/vim"
}}

Each user can also set his default editor with eselect (replace ''NUMBER'' with the wanted number):
{{Cmd|eselect editor list
|eselect editor set NUMBER}}

Actually eselect modifies the file above. It seems that the old method of editing {{Path|rc.conf}} doesn't work any more.

=== sudo editor ===
[[sudo]] does not preserve the user's environment variables and therefore may have a different default editor.

=== visudo editor ===
Due to the sensitive nature of {{Path|/etc/sudoers}} it may only edited via the command <tt>visudo</tt> which in turn is is limited to a predefined selection of editors. Call {{Cmd|man visudo}} for more information and read [[sudo]]
