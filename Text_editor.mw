You find more editors in the "[http://packages.gentoo.org/category/app-editors app-editors]" category.

== Set default ==
You can set system wide the default editor in the {{Path|/etc/env.d/99editor}}, e.g. switch to Vim:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/env.d/99editor|lang=bash|1=
EDITOR="/usr/bin/vim"
}}

Each user can also set his default editor with eselect (replace ''NUMBER'' with the wanted number):
{{Cmd|eselect editor list
|eselect editor set NUMBER}}

Actually eselect modifies the file above. It seems that the old method of editing {{Path|rc.conf}} doesn't work any more.
