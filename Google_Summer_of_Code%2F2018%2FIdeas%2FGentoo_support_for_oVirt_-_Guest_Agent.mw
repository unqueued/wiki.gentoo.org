<!-- Description goes here: --> 
[http://www.ovirt.org/ oVirt] is a complete open sourced virtualization management platform working with KVM. The ovirt-guest-agent is the service that runs in the guests. Patches should be submitted to upstream oVirt projects, mainly ovirt-guest-agent, to provide support to using Gentoo as operating system for the guests. This project includes the packaging of ovirt-guest-agent itself and required dependencies.
