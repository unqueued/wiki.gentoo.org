[[Article description::This article will focus on building and using the {{c|duperemove}} utility from the newest ('live') source code directly out of the git repository.]] An ebuild is in the main Gentoo repository. Those who would like to quickly install an older version can simply {{c|emerge}} the package.

== Installation ==

{{Note|Duperemove needs a kernel version equal to or greater than 3.13.}}

Install the following build time dependencies:

{{Emerge|params+=--update|{{=}}dev-db/sqlite:3 {{=}}dev-libs/glib:2}}

=== Get the source ===

{{Cmd
|mkdir ~/code
|cd ~/code
|git clone https://github.com/markfasheh/duperemove.git
}}

=== Compile and install ===

Compile the source using the {{c|make}} command:

{{Cmd
|cd ~/duperemove
|make
}}

At this point the {{c|dupremove}} utility can be ran from the current directory or it can be installed to typical locations on the operating system. To install use the make install command as root:

{{RootCmd|make install}}

You did it! Duperemove should now be manually built and installed.
