|Volunteer Testing|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Many of the typical Gentoo arch tester duties consist of repetitive tasks which could really gain in being unsupervised. Package keywording, stabilization, QA bug filing... should really be done by machines, not humans. Some distributions have build farms, but Gentoo has many options to cover making the testing process quite intensive. One idea that every Gentoo developer wants is to incorporate continuous integration into packages, which could be part of the project. The idea could be taken further and distribute the automated tests to idle home users machines, leveraging Gentoo infrastructure. It could have great impacts on QA and accelerating the stabilization process.
