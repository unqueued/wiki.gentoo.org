== Making executable file non-executable ==

Git treats mode changes just like a change to the content of the file.

{{cmd|chmod -x example.file|git add example.file}}

== Rolling back committed changes ==

If your commit has not been pushed yet, you can use git reset to remove the last commit.

{{cmd|git reset --hard HEAD^}}

If it has already been pushed, use git revert.

{{cmd|git revert <commit>}}
