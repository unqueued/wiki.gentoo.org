From the [https://jdebp.eu/Softwares/nosh/ nosh homepage]:''The nosh package is a suite of system-level utilities for initializing and running a BSD or Linux system, for managing daemons, for managing terminals, and for managing logging.''<ref name="home">[https://jdebp.eu/Softwares/nosh/ nosh - home]</ref>

The flexibility of nosh allows it to be ran alongside with systemd as an service manager at least.<ref>[https://github.com/tacatac/archnosh#nosh-service-manager-only-nosh-run-via-systemd Github - archnosh], running nosh as a service manager only.</ref>

nosh also includes 'convert-systemd-units' to convert systemd unit files to nosh format.
