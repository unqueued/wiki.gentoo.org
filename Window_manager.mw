Each system with an [[X]] server installed should have a window manager. The window manager [[Article description::manages the creation, manipulation, and destruction of on-screen windows.]]

== Classification ==
Windows managers can be dynamic, stacking or tiling in their behavior. Stacking window managers behave analogously to pieces of paper on a physical desktop, they can be stacked on top of one another, with the one at the top of the stack being the one that the user sees and interacts with. Tiling window managers represent windows as tiles, or split views, with windows displayed next to one another, but with none of the windows overlapping. Dynamic window managers are window managers that can dynamically switch between these two paradigms.
