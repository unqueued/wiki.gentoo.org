'''MySQL''' is [[Article description::a popular, free software relational database management system.]] It is often used in conjunction with web applications (such as many [[PHP]] sites), but has gained many more enterprise-level features since its start in 1994. An alternative fork is [[MariaDB]].

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

Before installing {{Package|dev-db/mysql}}, carefully consider the USE flags that influence the package deployment and features. The following table gives an overview of the package' supported USE flags:

{{USEflag|package=dev-db/mysql}}

=== Emerge ===

Once the proper USE flags have been set, install MySQL:

{{Emerge|dev-db/mysql}}

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

To have the database(s) started automatically at boot, add the mysql init script to the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add mysql default}}

After configuring the database, which is mentioned later in this document, start the mysql service:

{{RootCmd|rc-service mysql start}}

=== Preliminary configuration ===

The {{Package|dev-db/mysql}} package handles the preliminary setup of MySQL through the <code>--config</code> option:

{{Emerge|dev-db/mysql|params=--config}}

This will create a database, set proper permissions on it and assist in creating a good {{c|root}} password (this is for the MySQL {{c|root}} account, which is not related to the Linux {{c|root}} account).

To purge anonymous users and test databases from the installation, run {{c|mysql_secure_installation}} after the preliminary setup:

{{RootCmd|mysql_secure_installation}}

=== In-database configuration ===

When the database is up and running, connect to it using the {{c|mysql}} client application.

{{Cmd|mysql -u root -p -h localhost|output=<pre>
Enter root password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 1 to server version: 5.5.1
  
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.
  
mysql></pre>}}

From this point, a session to the MySQL instance is open, allowing for queries and administrative commands to be serviced.

=== Erasing command history ===

By default MySQL logs every action, including leaving plain text passwords in its history file.

To remove the history file:

{{RootCmd|rm /root/.mysql_history}}

Alternatively you can permanently disable history logging with the following:

{{RootCmd|ln -sf /dev/null /root/.mysql_history}}
