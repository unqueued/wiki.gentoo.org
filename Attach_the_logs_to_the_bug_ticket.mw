[[File:Bugzilla screenshot summary-keyword.png|thumbnail|Use the '''Add an attachment''' button below the description text box in order to attach files in bugzilla.]]

* '''Attach''' the logfile in {{Path|/var/tmp/portage/<category>/<packagename>/temp/build.log}}
* '''Compress''' large logfiles: {{Cmd|xz -9 {{Path|/var/tmp/portage/<category>/<packagename>/temp/build.log}}}} and upload the {{Path|build.log.xz}}. Attachments are limited to 1 MB per file. Ask developers how to proceed, if the compressed file is larger.

Bugs may be reported using an online form at https://bugs.gentoo.org/ or with {{Package|www-client/pybugz}} and [[Pybugz|attaching log files with '''bugz''']] on the command line.

[[File:Bugzilla attachments buildlog.png|thumbnail|One can see immediately that the required log is provided. The attachments are easy to access and do not clutter the comment fields.]]
* Do '''not paste files into comments''', because the ticket gets difficult to read. Developers often use tools to handle attachments.
* Do '''not upload files to pastebins'''. It is often important to read about a bug some years later. Links to external pages are not archived by gentoo and the information is lost. Some developers use tools to work on bugs and can not open external websites easily.

* '''Paste''' the output of {{Cmd|emerge --info <category/packagename>}} to the comment box.
