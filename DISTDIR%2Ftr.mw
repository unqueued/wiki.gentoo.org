'''<code>DISTDIR</code> değişkeni Portage'ın indirdiği kaynak kodu paketlerini saklayacağı yeri belirler. Öntanımlı olarak {{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles}} dizini kullanılır'''.

This location, which is also often referred to as the ''distfiles'' location, will host the source code archives of all software installed (or attempted to install) on the system. This location is not automatically cleaned up, so users should consider using tools such as <tt>eclean-dist</tt> (part of {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}) to keep the storage used by this location under control. Read the [[Eclean|Eclean article]] for more details.

Users can set the <code>DISTDIR</code> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}
