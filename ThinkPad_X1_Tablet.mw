Using a standard [https://gentoo.org/downloads/ stage3] installation everything should pretty much work out of the box.
== Keyboard ==
for some reason on kernels >= 4.2 the keyboard, trackpoint and touchpad are not working on the first boot. To work around this problem add '''i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset''' to your kernel command line:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default.grub|title=add to kernel command line|1=
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset"
}}

== Wifi ==
the intel soc wifi that comes with the processor (i7-7Y75 in my case) works with [iwlwifi].
