<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Multiple projects such as portage-utils and [https://github.com/pkgcore/pkgcore pkgcore] have their own C-based implementations of parsing package atoms and related support. At some point it would be nice if they all shared a common, well-tested implementation in the form of a library along with bindings for various languages (python currently being the most important). The main focuses here would be on efficiency, test coverage, and a well-defined API to support external tool development.
