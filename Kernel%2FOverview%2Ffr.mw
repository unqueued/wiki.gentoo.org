Ce document fournit une vue d'ensemble des différentes sources du noyau qu'offre Gentoo via Portage.

== Introduction ==

Comme pour tout dans Gentoo Linux, la philosophie de l'équipe Gentoo du noyau est de donner à l'utilisateur la plus grande liberté de choix possible. En jetant un coup d'œil à la sortie de la commande <code>emerge -s sources</code> on observe une grande variété de noyaux à disposition. Ce document a pour objectif de donner un bref aperçu de l'intérêt de chacun des jeux de patchs que Gentoo propose, et également d'expliquer les autres sources du noyau disponibles.

== Paquets noyau pris en charge ==

=== genkernel ===

{{c|genkernel}} est un outil de compilation pour le noyau et initframs qui possède une configuration par défaut, permettant l'activation automatique des options et pilotes de base dans le noyau. C'est la solution recommandée pour les utilisateurs qui ne se sentent pas à l'aise à l'idée de compiler un noyau à la main. 

Pour plus d'informations, reportez-vous à l'article [[genkernel|genkernel]].

=== Objectif général: gentoo-sources ===

Pour la plupart des utilisateurs, le noyau {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} est recommandé. C'est un noyau basé sur Linux 4.x, légèrement modifié pour régler certains problèmes de sécurité et certains bogues, et pour améliorer la compatibilité avec les architectures les  moins courantes. 

Le paquet {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} absorbe la plus grande partie des ressources de l'équipe Gentoo dédiée au noyau. Il est mis à la disposition de l'utilisateur par un groupe de développeurs talentueux, qui peuvent compter sur l'expertise du très populaire "kernel hacker" qu'est Greg Kroah-Hartman, mainteneur de udev et responsable des sous-systèmes USB et PCI du noyau Linux officiel. 

=== Pour les serveurs: hardened-sources ===

Le noyau {{Package|sys-kernel/hardened-sources}} est basé sur le noyau Linux officiel et cible les utilisateurs de Gentoo sur serveur. Il offre des additifs pour les nombreux sous-projets de Gentoo Hardened (Gentoo durci), comme la prise en charge de [http://selinuxproject.org/ SELinux] et de [http://grsecurity.net grsecurity], tout en procurant des améliorations de stabilité et de sécurité. Consultez la page du [[Project:Hardened|projet Hardened]] pour plus d'informations. 

{{Important|This kernel provides powerful patches for enhanced security. Please read the [[Hardened/Introduction_to_Hardened_Gentoo|introduction to Hardened Gentoo article]] before using it.}}

=== ck-sources ===

{{Package|sys-kernel/ck-sources}} is Con Kolivas's kernel patch set. This patchset is primarily designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity and is configurable for varying workloads (from servers to desktops). The patchset includes a different scheduler, MuQSS, designed to keep systems responsive and smooth even when under heavy load. Support and information is available at [http://kernel.kolivas.org http://kernel.kolivas.org] and in the <code>#ck</code> channel on [http://irc.oftc.net irc.oftc.net].

=== git-sources ===

The {{Package|sys-kernel/git-sources}} package tracks daily snapshots of the upstream development kernel tree. These kernels are good for users interested in kernel development or testing. Bug reports should go to the [http://bugzilla.kernel.org/ Linux Kernel Bug Tracker] or LKML (Linux Kernel Mailing List). 

=== Noyaux dépendant de l'architecture ===

{{Package|sys-kernel/mips-sources}} and {{Package|sys-kernel/xbox-sources}} are, as their names suggest, patched to run best on specific architectures. They also contain some of the patches for hardware and features support from the other patch sets mentioned above and below. 

== Paquets du noyau non pris en charge ==

Now to briefly describe some of the other {{Path|sys-kernel/*-sources}} which scrolled by when the {{c|emerge -s sources}} command was run. Below we discuss each one of them individually. These kernels are provided as a courtesy only — the various patch sets are not supported by the Gentoo kernel team. There is no specific preference to one source or another, so we review the kernel sources in alphabetical order.

=== aufs-sources ===

The {{Package|sys-kernel/aufs-sources}} package contains full kernel sources including the official genpatchset (found in gentoo-sources) for the 3.1x kernel tree and aufs3 support. This kernel is useful when attempting to utilize the aufs3 filesystem. For more information see the aufs3 page on [http://aufs.sourceforge.net/ Sourceforge] or the [http://dev.gentoo.org/~mpagano/genpatches/index.htm genpatches homepage].

=== pf-sources ===

The {{Package|sys-kernel/pf-sources}} kernel brings together parts of several different kernel patches. It includes the BFS patchset from {{Package|sys-kernel/ck-sources}}, the {{Package|sys-kernel/tuxonice-sources}} patches, [http://www.linuximq.net LinuxIMQ], and the [http://algo.ing.unimo.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/patches/ BFQ] I/O [http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Budget_Fair_Queuing_IO_Scheduler scheduler]. 

=== openvz-sources ===

OpenVZ is a server virtualization solution built on Linux. OpenVZ creates isolated, secure virtual private servers (VPSs) or virtual environments on a single physical server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that applications do not conflict. For more information, see [http://www.openvz.org http://www.openvz.org]. 

=== tuxonice-sources ===

The {{Package|sys-kernel/tuxonice-sources}} (formerly {{c|sys-kernel/suspend2-sources}}) are patched with both genpatches which includes the patches found in gentoo-sources, and the patches found in [http://www.tuxonice.net TuxOnIce] which are an improved implementation of suspend-to-disk for the Linux kernel, formerly known as ''suspend2''. 

Ce noyau est recommandé pour les utilisateurs d'ordinateurs portables qui attendent de pouvoir suspendre leur ordinateur et de reprendre le travail de n'importe où et de façon sûre. 

=== usermode-sources ===

usermode-sources are the User Mode Linux kernel patches and can be found in the {{Package|sys-apps/usermode-utilities}} package. These kernel patches are designed to allow Linux to recursively run within Linux. User Mode Linux is intended for testing and virtual server support. For more information about this amazing tribute to the stability and scalability of Linux, see [http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net]. 

For more information on UML and Gentoo, read the [[User-mode Linux/Guide|Gentoo User-mode Linux Guide]]

=== vanilla-sources ===

Many Linux users will probably be familiar with the {{Package|sys-kernel/vanilla-sources}} package. These kernels are copies of the official kernel sources released on [http://www.kernel.org/ http://www.kernel.org/]. Please note that the Gentoo kernel team does not patch vanilla-sources at all; they are for people who wish to run a completely unmodified Linux kernel. The Gentoo kernel team recommends {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} instead. 

Versions of the kernel can be found under this package: 3.x, 4.x.

== Paquets du noyau fournis antérieurement ==

=== aa-sources ===

{{c|aa-sources}} was a heavily modified kernel with all kinds of patches. The upstream maintainer stopped releasing kernel patchsets and subsequently this package has been removed. 

=== alpha-sources ===

{{c|alpha-sources}} was a 2.4 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the Alpha architecture. These patches have been developed and are now included in the mainline kernel. Alpha users can run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== Noyau dépendant de l'architecture  ===

{{c|cell-sources}} was a 2.6 kernel designed to run on the Sony PlayStation 3 game console. 

=== development-sources ===

{{c|development-sources}}, the official 2.6 kernel from [http://kernel.org kernel.org], can now be found under the [[#vanilla-sources|vanilla-sources]] package. 

=== gentoo-dev-sources ===

{{c|gentoo-dev-sources}}, a 2.6 kernel patched with bug, security, and stability fixes, can now be found under the [[#General_purpose:_gentoo-sources|gentoo-sources]] package. 

=== grsec-sources ===

The {{c|grsec-sources}} kernel source used to be patched with the latest grsecurity updates (grsecurity version 2.0 and up) which included, amongst other security-related patches, support for PaX. Grsecurity patches are included in the [[#For_servers:_hardened-sources|hardened-sources]] kernel, so this package is no longer available in Portage. 

=== hardened-dev-sources ===

{{c|hardened-dev-sources}} can now be found under the [[#For_servers:_hardened-sources|hardened-sources]] package. 

=== hppa-sources ===

{{c|hppa-sources}} was a 2.6 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the HPPA architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. HPPA users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== mm-sources ===

The {{c|mm-sources}} were based on [[#vanilla-sources|vanilla-sources]] and contained Andrew Morton's patch set. They included the experimental and bleeding-edge features that were going to be included in the official kernel (or were going to be rejected because they set systems on fire!). They were known to be always moving at a fast pace and could change radically from one week to the other; kernel hackers often used {{c|mm-sources}} as a testing ground for highly experimental stuff. They have since been removed from the Portage tree.

=== rsbac-dev-sources ===

The {{c|rsbac-dev-sources}} kernels can now be found under the {{Package|sys-kernel/rsbac-sources}} package. 

=== rsbac-sources ===

Back in the days of 2.6-based kernels {{Package|sys-kernel/rsbac-sources}} contained patches to use Rule Set Based Access Controls ([http://www.rsbac.org RSBAC]). It was removed due to lack of maintainers, but has has magically reappeared with the 3.10 kernel series. Use [[#For_servers:_hardened-sources|hardened-sources]] if additional security features are needed.

=== selinux-sources ===

{{c|selinux-sources}}, a 2.4 kernel including lots of security enhancements, has been obsoleted by security development in the 2.6 kernel tree. SELinux functionality can be found in the [[#For_servers:_hardened-sources|hardened-sources]] package. 

=== sh-sources ===

{{c|sh-sources}} was a 2.6 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the SuperH architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. SuperH users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== sparc-sources ===

{{c|sparc-sources}} was a 2.4 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the SPARC architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. SPARC users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches.

=== uclinux-sources ===

The {{c|uclinux-sources}} are meant for CPUs without MMUs as well as embedded devices. For more information, see [http://www.uclinux.org http://www.uclinux.org]. Lack of security patches as well as hardware to test on were the reasons this package is no longer found in the Portage tree. 

=== win4lin-sources ===

{{c|win4lin-sources}} were patched to support the userland win4lin tools that allowed Linux users to run many Microsoft Windows (TM) applications at almost native speeds. These kernel sources were removed due to security issues. 

=== xen-sources ===

{{c|xen-sources}} was a 2.6-based kernel that allowed running multiple operating systems on a single physical system. A user could create virtual environments in which one or more guest operating systems could run on a [http://www.xensource.com Xen]-powered host operating system. 

The {{c|xen-sources}} patches were incorporated into the mainline Linux kernel as of version 3.0. 

For more information on working with Xen and Gentoo, read the [[Xen|Xen article here on the wiki]]. 

=== zen-sources ===

The {{Package|sys-kernel/zen-sources}} package is designed for desktop systems. It includes code not found in the mainline kernel. The Zen kernel has patches that add new features, support additional hardware, and contains various tweaks for desktops. The Zen 3.8 kernel series is currently masked in the Portage tree. For more information on the Zen kernel please visit [http://zen-kernel.org Zen Kernel Live Sources website].
