This guide details the generic part of installing Gentoo on a Chromebook

==Developer mode==
All Chromebooks have a so-called ''Developer Mode'' allowing to boot on something else than ChromeOS.

This mode allows to use the so-called ''Legacy Boot'', which is a regular BIOS boot (booting from a MBR), this is NOT a UEFI boot.

{{Note|The Legacy Boot only works on x86, not arm.}}

===Entering Developer Mode===
The procedure is detailed [https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices here], find your model in the table and click on the link in the ''Model'' column.

{{warning|Entering or leaving Developer Mode wipes the Chromebook completely !}}

===Flashing the firmware===
The stock firmware should allow the Legacy Boot, but is sometimes bugged, requiring flashing.

There are various levels of flashing available, the most basic just allows the Legacy Boot, while the most complex turns the Chromebook into a regular PC, completely wiping any trace of ChromeOS.

The whole procedure and its various options are all detailed on [https://mrchromebox.tech/#firmware MrChromeBox's site]

{{Note|Depending on how much you want to modify the firmware, you might have to open your Chromebook to remove a special screw which prevents the firmware from being modified}}

==Installing Gentoo==
Once you have the Legacy Boot working (or the UEFI boot if you flashed a full firmware), installing Gentoo is rather straight-forward: boot on a liveUSB and follow the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page Handbook] as if installing on a regular x86_64 or arm machine.

==Instructions for specific models==
* [[Acer_Chromebook_C720|Acer Chromebook C720]]
* [[Asus_Chromebook_C201|Asus Chromebook C201]]
* [[Google_Chromebook_Pixel_LTE|Google Chromebook Pixel LTE]]
* [[Toshiba_Chromebook_2|Toshiba Chromebook 2]]

==Keyboard==
===Xorg===
====Layout====
The layout is supported by Xorg
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-keyboard.conf|1=
Section "InputClass"
  Identifier "Keyboard"
  MatchProduct "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
  MatchIsKeyboard "on"
  Option "XkbModel" "chromebook"
  Option "XkbLayout" "fr" # only needed for non-US keyboards
EndSection
}} 
The '''MatchProduct''' section might not fit your hardware, to check the correct name, use:
{{Cmd|grep "Using input driver" /var/log/Xorg.0.log|output=<pre>(...)
[617682.560] (II) Using input driver 'libinput' for 'AT Translated Set 2 keyboard'
(...)
</pre>}}

====Missing Keys====
Since some keys are missing, they are emulated with {{Key|Right Alt}}:
* {{Key|Right Alt}}+{{Key|Backspace}} = {{Key|Delete}}
* {{Key|Right Alt}}+{{Key|Left}} = {{Key|Home}}
* {{Key|Right Alt}}+{{Key|Right}} = {{Key|End}}
* {{Key|Right Alt}}+{{Key|Up}} = {{Key|PgUp}}
* {{Key|Right Alt}}+{{Key|Down}} = {{Key|PgDn}}
* {{Key|Right Alt}}+{{Key|Search}} = {{Key|Caps Lock}}
* {{Key|Right Alt}}+{{Key|F1 to F10}} = {{Key|F1 to F10}}

====Extra Keys====
{{Key|Search}} is treated as a windows key (Super_L)

====Multimedia Keys====
The multimedia keys should works as expected, except:
* {{Key|fullscreen}} (in the F4 spot) will be treated as {{Key|F11}}
* {{Key|next tab/window}} (in the F5 spot) will be treated as {{Key|F5}}


When used with {{Key|Ctrl}} or {{Key|Alt}} or {{Key|Shift}}, these keys will behave as {{Key|F1 to F10}}

Example: {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|Reload}} = {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|F3}}

==Troubleshooting==
===How to reboot===
Since there is no {{Key|Delete}} key, it is imposible to use {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|Delete}}. There is also no {{Key|Sys}} key, making it impossible to use the Magic Keys.

Fortunatly the firmware has a few keyboard shortcuts available:
* {{Key|Power}} for several seconds = power off
* {{Key|Reload}}+{{Key|Power}} = instant reboot

===Stuck at the warning screen===
Try using {{Key|Esc}}+{{Key|Reload}}+{{Key|Power}} to force a firmware reset
{{warning|This can wipe the Chromebook completely !}}

If that is not enough, follow the [https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595 offical procedure]

===Unexpected reboot when coming out of suspend to ram===
This can be caused by a missing TPM (Trusted Platform Module) driver in the kernel, see in Drivers â†’ Character Devices
