This page details the generic part of installing Gentoo on a Chromebook

==Developer mode==
All Chromebooks have a so-called "Developer Mode" allowing to boot on something else than ChromeOS.<br/>
This mode allows to use the so-called "Legacy Boot", which is a regular "BIOS" boot (booting from a MBR), this is NOT a UEFI boot.<br/>
The Legacy Boot only works on x86, not arm.

===Entering Developer Mode===
The procedure is detailed [https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices here], find your model in the table and click on the link in the "Model" column.

{{warning|Entering or leaving Developer Mode wipes the Chromebook completely !}}

===Flashing the firmware===
The stock firmware should allow the Legacy Boot, but is sometimes bugged, requiring flashing.
There are various levels of flashing available, the most basic just allows the Legacy Boot, while the most complex turns the Chromebook into a regular PC, completely wiping any trace of ChromeOS.

The whole procedure and its various options are all detailed on [https://mrchromebox.tech/#firmware MrChromeBox's site]

{{Note|Depending on how much you want to modify the firmware, you might have to open your Chromebook to remove a special screw preventing the firmware to be modified}}

==Installing Gentoo==
Once you have the Legacy Boot working (or the UEFI boot if you flashed a full firmware), installing Gentoo is rather straight-forward: boot on a liveUSB and follow the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page Handbook] as if installing on a regular x86_64 or arm machine.

==Troubleshooting==
===Forcing a reboot===
Since there is no {{Key|Delete}} key, it is imposible to use {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|Delete}}.<br/>
There is also no {{Key|Sys}} key, making it impossible to use the Magic Keys.<br/>
Fortunatly the firmware has a few keyboard shortcuts available:
* {{Key|Power}} for several seconds = power off
* {{Key|Reload}}+{{Key|Power}} = instant reboot
* {{Key|Esc}}+{{Key|Reload}}+{{Key|Power}} = reset firmware (don't use it unless you have no other choice !)
