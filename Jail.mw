This guide will go through how to use {{c|jail}} to set up a [[chroot]].

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|app-misc/jail}}

== Configuration ==

=== Create directories ===

Create the root directory for jail:

{{RootCmd|mkjailenv /var/chroot|output=<pre>
mkjailenv
A component of Jail (version 1.9 for linux)
http://www.gsyc.inf.uc3m.es/~assman/jail/
Juan M. Casillas <assman@gsyc.inf.uc3m.es>

Making chrooted environment into /var/jail
        Doing preinstall()
        Doing special_devices()
        Doing gen_template_password()
        Doing postinstall()
Done.
</pre>}}

=== Add a new user account in the main system ===

This account should have the chroot as its home directory and the jail binary as the shell:

{{RootCmd|useradd -g users --home /var/chroot --shell /usr/bin/jail larry}}

=== Add a new user account in the chroot ===

This account should have the same name as the account in the main system:

{{RootCmd|addjailuser /var/chroot /home/larry /bin/bash larry|output=<pre>
addjailuser
A component of Jail (version 2.0 for linux)
http://www.gsyc.inf.uc3m.es/~assman/jail/
Juan M. Casillas <assman@gsyc.inf.uc3m.es>

Adding user larry in chrooted environment /var/chroot
Done
</pre>}}

The home directory and shell paths in the above command refer to paths within the chroot.

=== Adding software ===

Add the set of basic programs to the jail:

{{RootCmd|addjailsw /var/chroot|output=<pre>
A component of Jail (version 2.0 for linux)
http://www.gsyc.inf.uc3m.es/~assman/jail/
Juan M. Casillas <assman@gsyc.inf.uc3m.es>

Done.
</pre>}}

Next we need to also add the login shell:

{{RootCmd|addjailsw /var/chroot -P /bin/bash --version}}

It may be necessary to pass an argument (<code>--version</code> as in the above example) to help jail figure out the libraries that are necessary for the program to run in the jail.

The command <code>addjailsw -P</code> can be used to add any programs to the chroot.

=== Finishing touches ===

Copy the shell startup scripts to the jail:

{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /var/chroot/etc/bash
|cp /etc/bash/bashrc /var/chroot/etc/bash
|cp /etc/profile /var/chroot/etc
|cp /etc/DIR_COLORS /var/chroot/etc
}} 

== Activating jail ==

Everytime you switch to the larry user you will be logged into the jail:

{{RootCmd|su - larry}}

The first time you run this command it will probably fail, see below.

== Troubleshooting ==

If it is not possible to su into target jail system and the following error message appears:

 jail: execve() : No such file or directory

it means that the dynamic linker is missing. We will need to first copy the correct library file (e.g. {{Path|/lib64/ld-2.24.so}} for amd64) to the chroot jail, then create a symlink to it in both the {{Path|/var/chroot/lib64}} directory as well as the {{Path|/var/chroot/lib}} directory.

The {{Path|/lib}} directory is not created by Jail, thus we will need to create it as there will be a symlink to the dynamic linker in there as well. 

First, let's copy the dynamic linker into our {{Path|/var/chroot/lib64}}:

{{RootCmd| cp -v /lib64/ld-2.24.so /var/chroot/lib64/}}

Now we'll make the /lib directory:

{{RootCmd| mkdir -v /var/chroot/lib}}

Now we'll make the symlinks -

{{RootCmd
| cd /var/chroot/lib64
| ln -sv ld-2.24.so ld-linux-x86_64.so.2
| cd ../lib
| ln -sv ../lib64/ld-linux-x86_64.so.2 ld-linux-x86_64.so.2
}}
