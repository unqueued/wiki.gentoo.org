This page will contain notes about my efforts to get Gentoo Prefix working in NetBSD 6

Currently I have built the toolchain, but need to go back and restart.

Bison must be installed *before* Bash, and Bash needs to have plugins enabled.

If Bash is built without plugins it will lack the print command which will cause
all packages which use libtool to fail with "print -r --" command not found.

More to come. Too tired to continue.
