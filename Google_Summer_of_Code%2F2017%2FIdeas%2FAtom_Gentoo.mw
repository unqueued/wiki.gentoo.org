|Atom Gentoo|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
The idea is to build a stateless operating system based on Gentoo. It would consist of a very minimal Gentoo image with automatic atomic updates. The work could consist of putting together a build service, and/or focusing on the update system, or anything around it.

Some inspirations:
* Stateless [https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/sdk-modifying-coreos.html CoreOS Container Linux] build scripts
* [https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/filesystem-autoupdate ChromeOS] file system updates
* [https://ostree.readthedocs.io/ OSTree] to boot and update filesystem trees
* The minimal [https://github.com/cernvm/cernvm-micro CERN] image and its HTTP [https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem read-only POSIX file system].
