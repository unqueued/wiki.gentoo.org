|Continuous Stabilization|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Gentoo packages are tested manually by a team of developers, generally on-demand, then marked as stable. Lots of packages are behind the stabilization process. One idea would be to automate the process using continuous integration (CI). The work could involve: designing CI for Gentoo packages, scheduling and distributing CI stabilization jobs to users willing to give some CPU time, and updating the portage tree automatically.
