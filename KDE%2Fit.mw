'''KDE''' è una community free software che produce un vasto campo di applicazioni, incluso il popolare ambiente desktop Plasma.

Il supporto Gentoo per il progetto KDE è eccellente, con un packaging completo di Framework KDE 5, plasma 5 e applicazioni 5, oltre ad una vasta gamma di altri software basati su KDE. 

== Prerequisiti ==

=== Profile ===

La scelta di un appropriato  [[Profile (Portage)|profile]], anche se non è richiesto, è raccomandato in quanto definisce  delle USE flag sia globali sia specifiche del pacchetto per garantire un ottima esperienza con KDE.

Al fine di scegliere il profilo più adatto, ecco la lista di quelli disponibili:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|output=<pre>
  [1]   default/linux/amd64/13.0
  [2]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
  [3]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop
  [4]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
  [5]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd
  [6]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/plasma
  [7]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/plasma/systemd
  ...
</pre>}}

Quindi, selezionare il profilo corretto sostituendo <code>X</code> con il corrispondente numero del profilo:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set X}}

Per l'ambiente desktop Plasma 5 scegliere <code>desktop/plasma</code> con [[OpenRC]] o <code>desktop/plasma/systemd</code> con [[systemd]].

=== Services ===

Before installing KDE related software it is recommended that several other services are set up first. Part of that is done automatically if a ''desktop/plasma'' or ''desktop'' [[Profile (Portage)|profile]] is used. These services are: 
* [[D-Bus]]: Enables use of the D-Bus message bus system.
* [[polkit]]: Enables the polkit framework for controlling privileges for system-wide services.
* [[udev]]: Enables support for udev Linux dynamic and persistent device naming.
* [[udisks]]: Enables support for some storage related services.

Follow the links for information how to set up these services. Note that other USE flag combinations than set in this profile may technically be possible (especially if selected applications are run instead of a full KDE Plasma desktop environment), but may be unsupported, untested, or lead to unexpected loss of functionality.

=== X server ===

Read and follow the instructions in the [[X server]] article to setup the X environment.

== Plasma ==

Plasma 5 is the current generation of KDE's desktop environment, based on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5.

{{Note|Before proceeding, make sure to choose a plasma profile. KDE 4 users will need to take extra steps.}}

=== Upgrade from Plasma 4 ===

Information on how to upgrade from Plasma 4, migration and troubleshooting can be found on the [[KDE/Plasma_5_upgrade|upgrade page]].

=== Installation ===

The {{Package|kde-plasma/plasma-meta}} package provides the full Plasma 5 suite, configured by the following USE flags:
{{USEflag|package=kde-plasma/plasma-meta|desc=}}

{{Emerge|kde-plasma/plasma-meta}}

Alternatively, {{Package|kde-plasma/plasma-desktop}} provides the basic desktop, leaving users free to install only the extra packages they require:

{{Emerge|kde-plasma/plasma-desktop}}

{{Note|Please note that such installations will be missing important packages such as {{Package|kde-plasma/powerdevil}} (power management, suspend and hibernate options) and {{Package|kde-plasma/systemsettings}} if this alternative installation is used.}}

=== Widgets ===

Many useful widgets are in the {{Package|kde-plasma/kdeplasma-addons}} package (already pulled in by {{package|kde-plasma/plasma-meta}}):

{{Emerge|kde-plasma/kdeplasma-addons}}

=== Display manager ===

[[SDDM]] (Simple Desktop Display Manager) is the recommended login manager and is pulled in automatically via {{package|kde-plasma/plasma-meta}} by default. This is the preferred option. Alternatively, [[LightDM]] can be used and pulled in by setting USE flag <code>-sddm</code> for {{package|kde-plasma/plasma-meta}}. Change the setting accordingly in {{Path| /etc/conf.d/xdm}}. Also, be sure to read through the [[SDDM]] page if further issues appear.

=== KWallet auto-unlocking ===

Many users will be introduced to {{Package|kde-frameworks/kwallet}}, Plasma's safe password management, while adding a (wireless) network connection after login. On many systems, there will actually be a second KWallet service present - {{Package|kde-apps/kwalletd}} is there to provide the same password storage functions to kdelibs4-based applications. {{Package|kde-plasma/kwallet-pam}} provides a mechanism to avoid being subsequently asked for access to kwallet after login.

{{Emerge|kde-plasma/kwallet-pam}}

It requires the following setup:
* For KWallet security, use classic blowfish encryption instead of GPG
* Choose same password for login and kwallet
* Configure a display manager with support for PAM - both {{Package|x11-misc/sddm}} and {{Package|x11-misc/lightdm}} fulfill that requirement:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/pam.d/sddm|title=Adding lines for KWallet PAM unlocking via SDDM|lang=bash|1=
-auth           optional        pam_kwallet5.so
-session        optional        pam_kwallet5.so auto_start
# The following two lines will also unlock kwalletd for kdelibs4-based applications
-auth           optional        pam_kwallet.so kdehome=.kde4
-session        optional        pam_kwallet.so
}}

{{Note|For LightDM, {{Path|/etc/pam.d/lightdm}} needs to be edited instead.}}

For managing kwallets, importing and exporting passwords, there is {{Package|kde-apps/kwalletmanager}}:

{{Emerge|kde-apps/kwalletmanager}}

For managing kwallets for kdelibs4-based applications like kopete or kmail:4:

{{Emerge|kde-apps/kwalletmanager:4}}

=== SSH/GPG Agent startup/shutdown scripts ===

ssh-agent scripts are located in {{Path|/etc/plasma/startup}} and {{Path|/etc/plasma/shutdown}}. The [[Keychain]] article provides more information about this.

== Applications ==

Releases consist of various applications and supporting libraries based on Qt 5/KDE Frameworks 5 as well as Qt 4/KDElibs 4, with the latter still being in long term support mode. In Portage, the distinction is made using slots <code>4</code> and <code>5</code>. Porting is an ongoing process where each major release is making inroads to Frameworks 5, and therefore contains both well matured and newly ported applications. Note that it also means potential dependency conflicts when two packages depend on slot 4 and 5 of the same library that can not be installed at the same time - such packages are dropped from *-meta.

| Basic applications such as file browser, editor, terminal emulator.
|-
| {{Package|kde-apps/kdeedu-meta}}
| Educational applications and games.
|-
| {{Package|kde-apps/kdegames-meta}}
| Standard desktop games.
|-
| {{Package|kde-apps/kdegraphics-meta}}
| Graphics applications such as image viewers, color pickers, etc.
|-
| {{Package|kde-apps/kdemultimedia-meta}}
| Audio and video playback applications and services.
|-
| {{Package|kde-apps/kdenetwork-meta}}
| Network applications and VNC services.
|-
| {{Package|kde-apps/kdepim-meta}}
| PIM applications such as emailer, addressbook, organizer, etc.
|-
| {{Package|kde-apps/kdesdk-meta}}
| Various development tools.
|-
| {{Package|kde-apps/kdeutils-meta}}
| Standard desktop utilities such as a archiver, a calculator, etc.
|-
| {{Package|kde-apps/kdewebdev-meta}}
| Web development tools.
|}

=== Installation ===

The {{Package|kde-apps/kde-apps-meta}} package provides the full Applications bundle, but alternatively, one or several smaller meta packages from the list above may be picked instead:

{{Emerge| kde-apps/kde-apps-meta}}

=== Localization ===

While Frameworks and Plasma are shipping their translations per-package, [[localization]] of KDE Applications is provided via separate <code>*-l10n</code> packages. The <code>nls</code> USE flag is enabled by default for linux [[Profile_(Portage)|profiles]], and it is used by KDE Applications meta packages to pull in the necessary dependencies.

If only a select few languages are desired, define the <var>L10N</var> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. E.g. to use the German language, set:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Setting the <var>L10N</var> variable for the German language|lang=bash|1=
L10N="de"
}}

To '''manually''' install these localization packages instead, use the following (complete) list or pick as desired:

{{Emerge|kde-l10n kde4-l10n kdepim-l10n}}

While the first two contain translations for the majority of KDE Applications (slot <code>5</code> and <code>4</code>), the latter  directly corresponds to - and is only relevant to users of - {{Package|kde-apps/kdepim-meta}} or its related packages.

=== KDE PIM ===

==== Available versions ====

In Portage, three variants of the KDE Personal Information Management (KDE PIM) suite (including {{Package|kde-apps/kmail}}, {{Package|kde-apps/kontact}}, and {{Package|kde-apps/korganizer}}) are available.

|-
| KDE PIM 16.12.2
| kde-apps/kdepim-meta-16.12.2
| gentoo
| Testing for {{Keyword|amd64}} and {{Keyword|x86}}
|}

==== KDE PIM 4.14.11 and earlier ====

At the time of writing, the current stable version range is at 4.14.11, which includes an Akonadi-based kmail (also known as kmail2) and is still based on Qt 4/KDElibs 4.

In addition, a "[https://launchpad.net/~pali/+archive/ubuntu/kdepim-noakonadi noakonadi fork]" is available as version 4.4.2016.01 (also known as kmail1). Adding a [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/kde.git/plain/Documentation/package.mask/kdepim-4.7 mask file] to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.mask}} is necessary to get it:

{{RootCmd|wget https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/kde.git/plain/Documentation/package.mask/kdepim-4.7 -O /etc/portage/package.mask/kdepim-4.7}}

Both variants are beginning to conflict with newer versions of packages. Adding certain per-package USE flag settings can solve some conflicts currently:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/kdepim-4|lang=bash|1=
>=app-crypt/gpgme-1.8.0 -cxx -qt5
app-office/kmymoney:4 pim
>=kde-apps/kwalletd-16.04.3-r1 -gpg
>=kde-frameworks/kwallet-5.29.0-r1 -gpg
}}

{{Emerge|kde-apps/kdepim-meta}}

==== KDE PIM 16.12 and later ====

The latest upstream release based on Qt 5/KF 5 remains testing until it is deemed suitable for stable use, but testing is appreciated.
 
Most, but not all of the codebase has been ported from {{Package|dev-qt/qtwebkit}} to {{Package|dev-qt/qtwebengine}} which is based on Chromium's Blink. By default, this package sets and uses the <code>system-ffmpeg</code> USE flag, which comes down to a {{Package|media-video/ffmpeg}} package dependency, so users preferring {{Package|media-video/libav}} for the rest of their system will need to switch off that USE flag.

Unfortunately, not all of the KDE Applications are compatible yet, with some packages still depending on Qt 4/KDElibs 4 based parts that can not be installed with modern KDE PIM at the same time. That includes {{Package|kde-apps/kopete}}, {{Package|kde-apps/klinkstatus}}, and possibly other packages outside of the kde-apps category. By default, these packages are no longer installed by {{Package|kde-apps/kde-apps-meta}}.

The following commands will deselect any packages from world that would still depend on these conflicting packages:

{{RootCmd|equery -q d kde-apps/kdepim-common-libs &#124; sed -e "s/-[0-9].*//" &#124; xargs emerge --deselect
|equery -q d kde-apps/kdepimlibs &#124; sed -e "s/-[0-9].*//" &#124; xargs emerge --deselect
|equery -q d kde-apps/akonadi &#124; sed -e "s/-[0-9].*//" &#124; xargs emerge --deselect}}

{{Note|This requires {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} to be installed. The [[Gentoolkit]] article provides more information about this useful utility.}}

Some conflicts with older packages may be solved by adding per-package USE flag settings:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/kdepim-16.12|lang=bash|1=
app-accessibility/simon -pim
app-office/calligra:4 -pim
kde-apps/kget:4 -gpg
<=kde-apps/kwalletd-16.04.3:4 -gpg
kde-apps/pykde4 -akonadi
kde-misc/tellico:4 -addressbook
}}

With all that prepared, KDE PIM is ready to be installed:

{{Emerge|kde-apps/kdepim-meta}}

=== kdesu5 ===

The utility that is used to run GUI programs as {{c|root}} is provided by {{Package|kde-plasma/kde-cli-tools}}. If built with USE flag <code>kdesu</code>, a graphical frontend to {{Package|kde-frameworks/kdesu}} is installed, which can be used by invoking {{c|kdesu5}}.

As always, ensure that the command actually needs to run as {{c|root}}, versus adding the regular user to the relevant groups or simply just running the command unprivileged.

== Frameworks ==

KDE Frameworks 5 is a collection of libraries and software frameworks that provide the foundation for KDE Plasma 5 and KDE Applications 5, but may be leveraged by any Qt application.

As Frameworks are mostly libraries and provide little user functionality, it's not necessary to install them manually - the required packages will be pulled in automatically as dependencies.
