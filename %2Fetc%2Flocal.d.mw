This article describes the setup of local.d scripts, which gets executed ones at boot or shutdown time.

== Configuration ==
All scripts in {{Path|/etc/local.d}} with the suffix ''.start'' will be executed at boot time, all scripts with suffix ''.stop'' at shutdown time.

To e.g. output the text ''Hello world!'' at boot time, create the new file {{Path|/etc/local.d/HelloWorld.start}}:
{{File|/etc/local.d/HelloWorld.start||<pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello world!"
</pre>}}
Afterwards mark the script as executable: 
{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/local.d/HelloWorld.start}}

To start the local.d scripts at boot time, add its init.d script to your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add local}}
