This guide will help you to migrate your existing Gentoo Linux SPARC installation from a non-multilib profile to a multilib profile.
== Overview ==

This guide will help you to migrate your existing Gentoo Linux SPARC installation from a non-multilib profile to a multilib profile. 

{{Important|Multilib is still experimental, do not use it if you have to rely on a fully working machine.}}
Multilib has advantages but it also has some disadvantages, these are the facts: 

{| class="table" style="text-align: left;"

! Advantages
| 
* You can compile and run 64-bit binaries
* GCC can handle -m32 and -m64 (biarch)
* One compiler for both kernel and userland


! Drawbacks
| 
* Compiling GCC takes twice as long as it did before
* Compiling glibc takes twice as long as it did before


|-

== Migration ==

=== Update the make.profile symlink ===

Because the profile is still in an experimental state you have to create/change the {{Path|/etc/make.profile}} symlink manually. 

The multilib profile also provides these three sub-profiles for your convenience, just like 2008.0 does: 

* desktop
* developer
* server

{{RootCmd
|rm /etc/make.profile
|ln -s /usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/sparc/experimental/multilib /etc/make.profile
}}
or
{{RootCmd|ln -s /usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/sparc/experimental/multilib/desktop /etc/make.profile}}
or
{{RootCmd|ln -s /usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/sparc/experimental/multilib/developer /etc/make.profile}}
or
{{RootCmd|ln -s /usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/sparc/experimental/multilib/server /etc/make.profile}}

=== Confirm that you read this guide ===

If someone would switch to the multilib profile without reading this guide, his/her system would break. To prevent that you need to confirm that you read this by adding <code>I_READ_THE_MULTILIB_MIGRATION_GUIDE</code> to the end of your {{Path|/etc/make.conf}}. 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/make.conf|title=Edit make.conf|lang=bash|1=
I_READ_THE_MULTILIB_MIGRATION_GUIDE="yes"
}}

=== Rename lib to lib32 ===

Though it is not fully compliant with FHS, common practice in Gentoo is to store 32-bit libraries in {{Path|lib32}}, 64-bit libraries in {{Path|lib64}} and to have {{Path|lib}} as a symlink to the default library directory. 

The 2008.0 profile stores libraries in {{Path|lib}}. These commands will rename all {{Path|lib}} directories to {{Path|lib32}} and create a symlink {{Path|lib}} to {{Path|lib32}}. Additionally they will create empty {{Path|lib64}} directories. 

{{Warning|Do not exit your shell while doing this! You would not be able to login again and would have to boot a LiveCD to recover.}}

{{Code|Rename lib to lib32|<pre>
$ mv /lib /lib32
# sln is a statically linked version of ln
$ sln lib32 /lib
$ mkdir -p /lib64
$ touch /lib64/.keep
$ for dir in /usr/qt/*/lib /usr/kde/*/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/lib
  do
    if [ -d ${dir} ]
    then
      mv ${dir} ${dir}32
      ln -sf lib32 ${dir}
      mkdir -p ${dir}64
      touch ${dir}64/.keep
    fi
  done
$ ldconfig
</pre>
}}

=== Remerge baselayout ===

For multilib profiles, {{Package|sys-apps/baselayout}} installs additional files, like {{Path|/etc/env.d/04multilib}}. To get these you need to remerge it. 

{{Emerge
|sys-apps/baselayout
|params+=--oneshot
}}
{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

=== Install a multilib glibc ===

To compile a multilib glibc you need a biarch gcc but to compile a biarch gcc you need a multilib glibc. You ''could'' compile glibc using a cross-compiler such as {{Package|sys-devel/kgcc64}} but that is not something you would enjoy... 

Therefore we will install a binary packages of glibc first and afterwards, once the migration is complete, remerge it with your USE- and CFLAGS.

{{RootCmd
|PKGDIR{{=}}"`mktemp -d`" PORTAGE_BINHOST{{=}}"http://dev.gentoo.org/~bluebird/sparc-multilib/packages" emerge --getbinpkgonly --usepkgonly --oneshot sys-libs/glibc
}}
{{Note|We set PKGDIR to a temporary directory to avoid picking up local PKGs}}

If you get ''All ebuilds that could satisfy {{Package|sys-libs/glibc}} have been masked.'' try using a different version of glibc, these two are available as binary packages: 

* ={{Package|sys-libs/glibc}}-2.8_p20080602-r1
* ={{Package|sys-libs/glibc}}-2.9_p20081201-r2

=== Install a biarch GCC ===

With a multilib glibc installed you can simply compile a biarch GCC using portage. 

{{Emerge
|sys-devel/gcc
|params+=--oneshot
}}

Now you need to configure your system to use the newly installed GCC using {{c|gcc-config}}. Replace <code>4.3.2</code> with the version you just installed. 

{{RootCmd
|gcc-config sparc-unknown-linux-gnu-4.3.2
|source /etc/profile
}}

=== Remerge glibc with your preferred settings ===

Remerge glibc with your system specific settings (USE-flags, CFLAGS and such).

{{Emerge
|sys-libs/glibc
|params+=--oneshot
}}

If the glibc compilation finishes without any strange error messages it means that your multilib setup is working. You can use {{c|file}} to verify this by checking the contents of {{Path|/lib64}}. 

{{Cmd
|file /lib64/libc-*.so
|output=<pre>
/lib64/libc-2.7.so: ELF 64-bit MSB shared object, SPARC V9, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.6.9, stripped
</pre>}}

=== Unmerge kgcc64 ===

{{Package|sys-devel/gcc}} can compile the kernel now, therefore you don't need {{Package|sys-devel/kgcc64}} anymore to do it. If you have some scripts that need it, just replace <code>sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc</code> with <code>sparc-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -m64</code>. 

{{Emerge
|sys-devel/kgcc64
|params+=--oneshot--unmerge
}}

=== Remerge world ===

{{Note|This step is optional.}}
Your system was build with {{Path|lib}} as library directory, now it is {{Path|lib32}}. Though you will not notice anything because there is a symlink in place but if you have a lot of spare CPU time and like your system clean... 

Or in other words: If you are one of those guys who uses Portage's multilib-strict feature just for the fun of it...this is for you! 

{{Emerge
|world
|params+=--emptytree
}}

== Closing-off ==

=== Usage example ===

Here's a simple example how to compile a hello world program in both 32 and 64-bit. 

{{CodeBox|title=Sample hello world program, hello_world.c|lang=c|1=
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  printf("hello, world\n");
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
}}
Compile it as 32-bit binary:
{{Cmd|sparc-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -m32 -o hello_world hello_world.c}}
or
{{Cmd|sparc-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c}}

{{Note|If you specify neither -m32 nor -m64 the compiler will default to -m32.}}
Compile it as 64-bit binary:
{{Cmd|sparc-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -m64 -o hello_world hello_world.c}}

=== Things you should not do ===

So now you have a multilib installation and you are thinking about adding <code>-m64</code> to <code>CFLAGS</code> in {{Path|/etc/make.conf}} and recompiling your entire userland in 64-bit? '''PLEASE DO NOT!'''

{{Warning|''Doing this will render your system unusable!'' Any bugs you report will just be closed without any further action.}}
While compiling everything in 64-bit may be a good idea on other 64-bit architectures, like {{Keyword|amd64}}, on {{Keyword|sparc}} it is not. There are good reasons why we have been using a pure 32-bit userland until now, some of these are: 

* 32-bit is faster than 64-bit
* 32-bit is well tested, 64-bit is not tested at all
* 2039 is still long way off

The only reasons why it ''might'' be appropriate to compile an application in 64-bit are: 

* It needs to access more than 4GB of memory. In the real world this only applies to huge databases.
* It needs to talk to the kernel directly. Some applications, like {{Package|net-firewall/iptables}}, contain ugly hacks to support the 64-bit kernel/32-bit userland thing.
* It is a kernel.

If you would like to read more about the differences between 32 and 64-bit, there are dozens of webpages about it on the internet, one of them is [http://www.superlogic.net/downloads/pub/docs/64bit.htm http://www.superlogic.net/downloads/pub/docs/64bit.htm].
