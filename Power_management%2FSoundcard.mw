== Power-saving mode ==

The Intel HDA driver has a power-saving mode to suspend the soundcard after some time of inactivity.

=== Kernel ===

Systems with an AC97 soundcard need to activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Sound card support  --->
        <*> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
            [*] PCI sound devices  --->
                <*> Intel/SiS/nVidia/AMD/ALi AC97 Controller
            [*] Generic sound devices  --->
                [*] AC97 Power-Saving Mode
                (10)  Default time-out for AC97 power-save mode
}}

Systems with a HDA soundcard  need to activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Sound card support  --->
        <*> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
            [*] PCI sound devices  --->
                <*> Intel HD Audio  --->
                    [*] Aggressive power-saving on HD-audio
                    (10)  Default time-out for HD-audio power-save mode
}}

=== Runtime tuning ===

The driver can be tuned in the [[sysfs]] filesystem under {{Path|/sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters}}:

* The {{Path|power_save_controller}} knob controls, if power-saving mode is enabled. It is preset by the kernel option ''... power-saving ...''.
* The {{Path|power_save}} knob sets the time-out in seconds. It is preset by the kernel option ''Default time-out ...''

=== pm-utils ===

The {{Package|sys-power/pm-utils}} package contains a script to enable the power-saving mode when on battery and disable when on AC. It overrides the default values of the kernel.

If you use pm-utils, but don't want this kind of regulation, disable the script:

{{RootCmd|touch /etc/pm/power.d/intel-audio-powersave}}

== PulseAudio ==

If you have an Intel HDA soundcard and use [[PulseAudio]], you probably want the following kernel option to improve power-saving:

{{KernelBox|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Sound card support  --->
        <*> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
            [*] PCI sound devices  --->
                <*> Intel HD Audio  --->
                    (2048) Pre-allocated buffer size for HD-audio driver
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

If you hear a unwanted click sound, when the power-saving mode enables, disable the power-saving mode in the kernel.
