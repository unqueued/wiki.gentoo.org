To install a desktop environment such as GNOME3 requires the use of systemd but the present handbook is based on the use of Openrc. It just indicates that changes have to be made when using systemd but never tells the user where the changes occur. 
As for the systemd page, it mainly concentrate on an update starting from an existing system. Thus, it can be a kind of challenge, specially for a new comer to Gentoo, to install a GNOME3 desktop from scratch.
The purpose of this page is to indicate where changes have to be made to the current handbook to do so.
The indication given refer mainly to an amd64 install.
