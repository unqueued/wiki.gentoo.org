{{Lowercase title}}
'''trident''' is the open source graphics drivers for [[Wikipedia:Trident Microsystems|Trident]] graphics cards.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->

        If your card sits in an AGP slot, choose your AGP driver:
        (Note: ALI chipsets are typically bundled with Trident graphics cards in laptops)
        <*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
            <*> ALI chipset support

        <*> Support for frame buffer devices  --->
            [*] Enable firmware EDID
            [*] VESA VGA graphics support
            <*> Trident/CyberXXX/CyberBlade support
</pre>}}

=== Firmware ===
Unknown IRQ microcode needed for Trident graphics support at this time, since the Kernel driver (tridentfb) should support most functions for Trident cards. Unknown KMS details (may not work without it?).

Make sure firmware for your model (check available ones in {{Path|/lib/firmware/trident}}) is included in kernel:
{{Kernel|Including trident firmware|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
	-*- Userspace firmware loading support
	[*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
		(trident/<YOUR-MODEL>.bin)
		(/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
</pre>}}

Below is a list of the firmware files needed for each family of cards:

No known firmware files are needed for any particular Trident card at this time.

=== Driver ===
{{VIDEO_CARDS|trident}}

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== xorg.conf ===
The [[X server]] is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit X.Org's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

You can force the X server to use desired driver with:
{{VIDEO CARDS/xorg.conf|trident}}

=== Framebuffer (GRUB or LILO)===
video=tridentfb:1024x768-16@60
