'''trident''' is a family of the X.Org graphics drivers for [http://www.freebase.com/view/en/trident_microsystems Trident] graphics cards. This article details how to configure the kernel and your userspace in order to use the ''trident'' (tridentfb) driver.

== Documentation ==
Full Documentation can be found under {{Path|/usr/src/linux/<your_kernal_name_here>/Documentation/fb/tridentfb.txt}}

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options, note that you don't need to enable ''AGP Support'' if your card doesn't sit in a AGP slot:
{{Kernel|Including trident driver|<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
	[*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
	Graphics support  --->
		<*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
			<*> ALI chipset support

			(NOTE: ALI chipsets are typically bundled with
			Trident graphics cards in laptops, but choose your
			own correct agpgart here!)

			<*> Support for frame buffer devices  --->
				[*] Enable firmware EDID
				[*] VESA VGA graphics support
				<*> Trident/CyberXXX/CyberBlade support

				(NOTE: the above Trident support enables the Kernel
				"tridentfb" framebuffer driver to be used
				such as video=tridentfb:1024x768-16@60)
</pre>}}

=== Firmware ===
Unknown IRQ microcode needed for Trident graphics support at this time, since the Kernel driver (tridentfb) should support most functions for Trident cards.  Unknown KMS details (may not work without it?).

Make sure firmware for your model (check available ones in <tt>/lib/firmware/trident</tt>) is included in kernel:
{{Kernel|Including trident firmware|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
	-*- Userspace firmware loading support
	[*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
		(trident/<YOUR-MODEL>.bin)
		(/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
</pre>}}

Below is a list of the firmware files needed for each family of cards:

No known firmware files are needed for any particular Trident card at this time.

=== Framebuffer (GRUB or LILO)===
video=tridentfb:1024x768-16@60

=== Driver ===
{{VIDEO_CARDS|trident}}

You can force X11 to use desired driver with:
{{VIDEO CARDS/xorg.conf|trident}}
