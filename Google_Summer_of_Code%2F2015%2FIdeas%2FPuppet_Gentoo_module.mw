|Puppet Gentoo module|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
[https://puppetlabs.com/ Puppet] is a tool for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management configuration management] â€” in other words, maintaining Gentoo by defining infrastructure as code rather than manually editing config files. This is extremely powerful for scaling servers up, and it greatly increases the efficiency of sysadmins. It further makes it easy to track changes to configurations over time, maintain them in git, do rollbacks, and more. The [https://github.com/gentoo/puppet-portage/ Puppet Portage module] supports a bunch of Gentoo specific operations (more info can be found in its [https://github.com/gentoo/puppet-portage/blob/master/README.markdown README] file). There are lots of issues and feature requests needed, that can be found in its [https://github.com/gentoo/puppet-portage/issues issue tracker] in Github that should be implemented. This is an extension of the [[Google Summer of Code/2013/Ideas/Puppet Portage module|Puppet Portage module]] project from previous year.
