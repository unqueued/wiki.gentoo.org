== Graphics Drivers ==

The Inspiron 3537 comes with an integrated Intel graphics chip and dedicated AMD Radeon graphics card.
It is possible to use hybrid switchable graphics with the use of PRIME.

For PRIME to work correctly, it is advised to compile both drivers [[Intel|intel]] and [[Radeon|radeon]] with DRI3 enabled.

Currently the Intel driver requires a patch to enable DRI3 as the ebuild ships with ''--disable-dri3'' due to users experiencing crashes. 
Instead of using a patch, it is recommended to use the x11 portage overlay, considering you have [[Layman|layman]] installed, this is done by running: 

{{RootCmd|layman -a x11}}

And then installing the drivers:

{{RootCmd|emerge -av xf86-video-intel xf86-video-ati}}

=== Configuring Xorg ===

A barebone config is needed:

{{CodeBox|title=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf|1=
Section "Device"
   Identifier "Intel Graphics"
   Driver "intel"
   Option "TearFree" "true"
   Option "DRI" "3"
   Option "AccelMethod" "SNA"
EndSection
}}

=== Hybrid Graphics ===

To offload applications to the dedicated GPU, add the PRIME prefix before the command:

{{Cmd|DRI_PRIME{{=}}1 ./some-application-you-want-to-offload}}

== Network ==

=== Ethernet ===

To enable Ethernet support make sure you have the following kernel options enabled:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable ethernet support|<pre>
Device Drivers --->
  Network device support --->
    Ethernet Driver Support --->
      [*] Realtek Devices
      [*] Realtek 8169 gigabit ethernet support
</pre>
}}

=== Wireless ===

Consult the [[wifi#Kernel|Wifi]] wiki page for enabling WiFi support in the kernel.

The Broadcom Wireless cards requires proprietary firmware and drivers which you can get by installing the [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-wireless/broadcom-sta broadcom-sta] package

{{RootCmd|emerge -av broadcom-sta}}

After that you can use a network manager like [[wpa_supplicant|WPA Supplicant]].

== Touchpad ==

First, install the synaptics driver
{{RootCmd|emerge -av xf86-input-synaptics}}

After that, create a configuration file

{{CodeBox|title=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-synaptics.conf|1=
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "Touchpad Catchall"
	Driver "synaptics"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
	Option "TapButton1" "1"
EndSection
}}
