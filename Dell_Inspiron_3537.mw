== Firmware ==

Due to errata in the processor, it is advised to install and keep the CPU microcode up-to-date. See [[Intel_microcode|intel microcode]].

== Kernel ==

Follow the [[Intel|intel]] and [[Radeon|radeon]] articles to enable the required kernel options.

== Configuration ==

=== Configuring Xorg ===

A barebone config is needed:

{{CodeBox|title=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf|1=
Section "Device"
   Identifier "Intel Graphics"
   Driver "intel"
   Option "TearFree" "true"
   Option "DRI" "3"
   Option "AccelMethod" "SNA"
EndSection
}}

=== Hybrid Graphics ===

To offload applications to the dedicated GPU, add the PRIME prefix before the command:

{{Cmd|DRI_PRIME{{=}}1 command_here}}

=== Configuring the touchpad ===

This enables horizontal scrolling. Tapping with two fingers acts as a rightclick, and a tap with three fingers acts as a middleclick.

{{CodeBox|title=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-synaptics.conf|1=
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "Touchpad Catchall"
	Driver "synaptics"
	MatchIsTouchpad "yes"
	Option "TapButton1" "1"
	Option "TapButton2" "3"
	Option "TapButton3" "2"
	Option "CornerCoasting" "1"
	Option "AccelFactor" "0.05"
	Option "HorizTwoFingerScroll" "1"
	Option "FingerHigh" "40"
	Option "CoastingSpeed" "0"
	Option "CoastingFriction" "0"
	Option "ClickTime" "15"
EndSection

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Wrong turbo multipliers ===

Dell seems to patch the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-specific_register MSR] and downclock the processor.
The stock Intel configuration is 30/27/27/27, Dell changes this to 27/25/25/25, ie. 2.7GhZ with a single core, and 2.5GhZ with 2+ cores.

This can be reverted back to the default with the use of [https://github.com/01org/msr-tools msr-tools].

{{Warning|The following is for experienced users only. Misuse of these tools can potentially damage/brick your CPU. Proceed only if you know what you are doing.}}

First, we use the <code>rdmsr</code> utility to read the current value of the MSR register:
{{RootCmd|sudo rdmsr 0x01ad}}
This should return the value <code>1919191b</code> which corresponds to 27/25/25/25.
Note that the order is reversed, the highest multiplier (for single core) in this case is last (1b).
Next, we write the new multiplier configuration:
{{RootCmd|sudo wrmsr 0x01ad 0x1b1b1b1e}}
This will set the multipliers to 30/27/27/27.

{{Note|Setting the wrong multiplier will downclock the CPU to its lowest multiplier. The current configuration can be viewed with [https://github.com/DimitryAndric/i7z i7z].}}
