{{c|badblocks}} is [[Article description::a small program for stress testing [[wikipedia:Block device#Block devices|block devices]].]] Similar to {{c|memtest86+}}, badblocks reads and writes small patterns of bytes to block devices.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

badblocks comes as part of the {{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}} package and should be available as part of the default system profile.

== Usage ==

=== Invocation ===

{{Invocation|badblocks|output=<pre>
Usage: /sbin/badblocks [-b block_size] [-i input_file] [-o output_file] [-svwnf]
       [-c blocks_at_once] [-d delay_factor_between_reads] [-e max_bad_blocks]
       [-p num_passes] [-t test_pattern [-t test_pattern [...]]]
       device [last_block [first_block]]
</pre>}}

=== Test a drive ===

To test a drive with visual progress use the <code>-s</code> and <code>-w</code> options followed by the path to the block device.

{{Warning|All data on the device will be completely overwritten and destroyed; be sure to create backups as needed to preserve data that should be saved!}}

{{RootCmd|badblocks -s -w /dev/<device>}}

Replace <code><device></code> in the command above with the block device that is to be tested. badblocks should run through a series of four tests and return output similar to the following:

{{GenericCmd|<pre>
Testing with pattern 0xaa: done
Reading and comparing: done
Testing with pattern 0x55: done
Reading and comparing: done
Testing with pattern 0xff: done
Reading and comparing: done
Testing with pattern 0x00: done
Reading and comparing: done
</pre>}}
