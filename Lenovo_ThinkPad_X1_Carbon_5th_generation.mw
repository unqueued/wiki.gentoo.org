These are my notes on getting my Thinkpad X1 Carbon 5th gen working under Gentoo.

Overall, it's been pretty straight forward and worked well. Be sure to check out [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_5) The ArchLinux wiki] for some information as well.

If this is useful, please contribute - I didn't write great notes as I went.

=== SSD ===
Worked well out of the box, but took me ten minutes to find it under [[NVMe|/dev/nvme0]].
I assume you need the "CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NVME", but I didn't test without.

=== Graphics ===
Using the i915 kernel module (which X11 calls "intel").

make.conf has VIDEO_CARDS="intel i965"

Currently DRI disabled with: Option "DRI" "false", not sure if I need that.

=== Wifi ===
Worked out of the box, iwlwifi module

=== 4G / LTE / "Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ X7 LTE-A" / EM7455 ===
I haven't got this working yet, but I've emailed the mbim developers for some information.

Uses the cdc_mbim module, device shows up under /dev/cdc-wdm0, mine's stuck in "sim-missing"

=== Webcam ===
Works well, can't compare quality or anything but no setup issues. Used the "uvcvideo" module.

=== Thunderbolt Dock - 40AC0135US ===
I've tested running multiple monitors (via displayport), and usb devices, over this dock.

It works great out of the box, and for hotplugging I needed to enable CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI in the kernel.
