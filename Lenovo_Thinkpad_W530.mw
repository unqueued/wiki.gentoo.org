The Lenovo Thinkpad W530 and its associated hardware components can (potentially) be difficult to configure properly in Gentoo. This article has been written as configuration guide to help users work out some of the gritty details needed to get this notebook working as it should while using Gentoo. 

{{Note|Do not expect to have exactly the same hardware listed in this guide in ''your'' W530. The hardware listed here is to be used as an example. Some of the components may be similar, but there are always variants in computers depending on what hardware was purchased. See the ThinkWiki.org link in the [[Lenovo_Thinkpad_W530#External_resources|External resources]] section for a review of possible factory hardware setups.}}

== Installation ==

=== Preparation ===

Things to be aware of when before installing Gentoo Linux on any machine:

# '''Backups:''' If the computer owner finds any value in being able to restore the factory existing operating system, make sure appropriate measures are taken to create a full system restoration. This is a nice fall back option in the case something goes wrong while installing Linux. 
# '''Time:''' Allot enough time for installing Gentoo. The length of the install process varies. Experienced Gentoo users are mostly limited by the speed of their current hardware where beginners are limited by the Gentoo learning curve.
# '''Diligence:''' Dedication is required in order to configure all parts of the hardware to work properly. Unfortunately most manufacturers do not deliver open source drivers for their hardware. Linux users go through great lengths in order to build or find open source drivers that are compatible with their hardware.

== Configuration ==

=== Kernel ===

For users new to Gentoo configuring the [[Kernel|kernel]] for a certain hardware platform can be among the trickiest tasks. Do not despair! There are many articles on the Wiki available to help with all kernel related things. The sections below provide information on the two main methods of kernel configuration. Currently no tool exists to automatically detect and configure hardware for all platforms, especially if experimental or new kernel features will be used.

==== Manual ====

Use the <tt>make menuconfig</tt> command to manually configure kernel features:

{{RootCmd|make menuconfig|}}

After configuration run the following commands in this to build and install the system's kernel and modules:

{{RootCmd
|make
|make modules
|make install
|make modules_install}}

==== genkernel ====

The [[genkernel]] tool can also be used to help build the kernel and the initramfs.

After downloading a kernel sources packages, start the build process by running the following command:

{{RootCmd|genkernel --install --menuconfig all}}

==== Additional help with kernel configuration ====

For additional help with kernel configuration see the [[Kernel#Configuration_help|configuration help section]] in the [[Kernel|kernel article]].

=== X11 ===

More information on configuring X11 can be found in the [[Xorg/Configuration|Xorg configuration article]].

==== Intel graphics ====

Want to configure the integrated graphics card (Intel GPU)? This is the section!

{{KernelBox|1=
Device drivers -->
  Graphics support -->
    Direct Rendering Manager -->
      <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
        [*] Enable modesetting on intel by default
}}

This {{Path|xorg.conf}} can make the integrated Intel GPU work properly:

{{fileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf|1=

Still to come...

}}

==== Nouveau & Intel graphics ====

Still to come...

==== NVidia proprietary graphics ====

Still to come...

=== USB ===

The Wiki's [[USB/Guide|USB guide]] can be helpful for configuring anything USB related on the system.

==== Power management ====

If the default USB power saving features are bothersome they can disabled by adding a configuration file to {{Path|/etc/modprobe.d/}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/modprobe.d/usb_auto_suspend_disable.conf|1=
#This example disables USB power saving altogether
options usbcore autosuspend=-1
}}

For more information visit Kernel.org's [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/power-management.txt USB Power Management page].

== Helpful tools ==

If learned how to use properly, these tools will help diagnose problems. They are included on the Gentoo-based SystemRescueCD, which is a good distribution when installing or troubleshooting Gentoo systems. Be sure to emerge them on the system after the install is complete. This will help with future troubleshooting.

=== Software ===

For more hardware detection tools see the [[Hardware_detection|hardware detection article]].

== Tips ==

==== Caching Portage in tmpfs ====

When using a SSD or HHD with a lot of RAM (16GB is more than enough) it is possible to both expand the life of the drive and speed up build time by caching the Portage {{Path|tmp}} directory entirely in RAM. Be sure to adjust to the amount of allocated memory. The example below allows Portage to use maximum of 10GBs of RAM (tmpfs) during compiles. Read more about caching Portage in [[tmpfs]] by traveling over to [[Portage_TMPDIR_on_tmpfs|this article]].

{{fileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|title=Adding Portage temp directory to 10GBs of tmpfs:|1=
tmpfs		/var/tmp/portage	tmpfs	uid=portage,gid=portage,mode=0775,size=10G,noatime	0 0
}}

After {{path|/etc/fstab}} has been modified, Portage's temp directory will be mounted in RAM on every boot. To mount Portage temp directory now simply run this command:

{{RootCmd|mount /var/tmp/portage}}
