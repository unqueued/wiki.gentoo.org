The Lenovo Thinkpad W530 and its associated hardware components can (potentially) be difficult to configure properly in Gentoo. This article has been written as configuration guide to help users work out some of the gritty details needed to get this notebook working as it should while using Gentoo. 

{{Note|Do not expect to have exactly the same hardware listed in this guide in ''your'' W530. The hardware listed here is to be used as an example. Some of the components may be similar, but there are always variants in computers depending on what hardware was purchased. See the ThinkWiki.org link in the [[Lenovo_Thinkpad_W530#External_resources|External resources]] section for a review of possible factory hardware setups.}}

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== Preparation ===

Adequate preparation should be established for the case something should go wrong in the middle of installing Gentoo. The following list does not only apply to the current hardware list in this article; it generally applies to whenever attempting to install Linux on any machine:

; Backups
: If the computer owner finds any value in being able to restore the ''existing'' factory operating system, make sure appropriate measures are taken to create a full system restoration before starting to install Linux. This is a nice fall back option in the case something goes terribly and unexpectedly wrong.
; Time
: Allot enough ''time'' for installing Gentoo. The length of the install process varies. Experienced Gentoo users are mostly limited by the speed of their current hardware setups, beginners are limited by the Gentoo learning curve (which can be a steep climb).
; Diligence
: Sometimes diligence is required in order to configure all parts of the hardware to properly. Unfortunately most manufacturers do not deliver open source drivers for their hardware. Linux users can go through great lengths in order to build or find open drivers that are compatible with the on their particular machine hardware. Depending on the machine, configuration could take the majority of the time. Thankfully Linux has become much more capable and, with the right knowledge, can actually be installed on more processor architectures than any other operating system. In this case user knowledge is the limiting factor.

== Configuration ==

=== Kernel ===

For users new to Gentoo configuring the [[Kernel|kernel]] for a certain hardware platform can be among the trickiest tasks. Do not despair! There are many articles on the Wiki available to help with all kernel related things. The sections below provide information on the two main methods of kernel configuration. Currently no tool exists to automatically detect and configure hardware for all platforms, especially if experimental or new kernel features will be used.

==== Manual ====

Use the {{c|make menuconfig}} command to manually configure kernel features:

{{RootCmd|make menuconfig|}}

After configuration run the following commands in this to build and install the system's kernel and modules:

{{RootCmd
|make
|make modules
|make install
|make modules_install
}}

==== genkernel ====

The [[genkernel]] tool can also be used to help build the kernel and the initramfs.

After downloading a kernel sources packages, start the build process by running the following command:

{{RootCmd|genkernel --install --menuconfig all}}

==== Additional help with kernel configuration ====

For additional help with kernel configuration see the [[Kernel#Configuration_help|configuration help section]] in the [[Kernel|kernel article]].

=== X11 ===

More information on configuring X11 can be found in the [[Xorg/Guide|Xorg guide]].

==== Intel graphics ====

Want to configure the integrated graphics card (Intel GPU)? This is the section!

{{KernelBox|1=
Device drivers -->
   Graphics support -->
      <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
         <*> Enable legacy fbdev support for your modesetting driver
      <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
}}

Set the <var>VIDEO_CARDS</var> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
VIDEO_CARDS="intel"
}}

The X server should be able to automatically detect the correct resolutions. No {{Path|xorg.conf}} should be required for this graphics mode. It is important to note that Intel's integrated graphics driver will only drive the attached laptop display. No external monitors can be ran unless the graphics are in discrete mode (see below).

Finally, when rebooting the system, press {{Key|F12}}, then {{Key|Tab}}, then scroll down three lines to enter the motherboard's firmware. Scroll over the right one frame, then choose {{Path|Display}}. Select {{Path|Integrated}} graphics mode and disable Operating System detection for Optimus.

==== Nouveau and Intel graphics ====

{{KernelBox|1=
Device drivers -->
   Graphics support -->
      <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
         <*> Enable legacy fbdev support for your modesetting driver
      <*> Nouveau (NVIDIA) cards
      <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
}}

When using both [[Intel]] and nouveau drivers, simply add both values to the <var>VIDEO_CARDS</var> variable and update the [[World set (Portage)|@world set]]:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
VIDEO_CARDS="intel nouveau"
}}

{{Emerge|params+=--update --deep --newuse|@world}}

==== NVidia Optimus graphics ====

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf|lang=xorg.conf|1=
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier "layout"
    Screen 0 "nvidia"
    Inactive "intel"
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier "nvidia"
    Driver "nvidia"
    BusID "01:00:0"
    Option "RegistryDwords" "EnableBrightnessControl=1"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "nvidia"
    Device "nvidia"
    Option "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration"
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier "intel"
    Driver "modesetting"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "intel"
    Device "intel"
EndSection
}}

Finally, enter the motherboard's firmware and select {{Path|Discrete}} graphics mode and disable Operating System detection for Optimus.

=== USB ===

The Wiki's [[USB/Guide|USB guide]] can be helpful for configuring anything USB related on the system.

==== Microphone ====

The USB Audio kernel driver must be enabled for the USB microphones to work properly. This is the case for most laptops since their microphones are connected on the USB bus.

{{KernelBox|title=Enable support for <var>SND_USB_AUDIO</var>|1=
Device Drivers -->
   Sound card support -->
      Advanced Linux Sound Architecture -->
         USB sound devices -->
            <*> USB Audio/MIDI driver
}}

==== Power management ====

If the default USB power saving features are bothersome they can disabled by adding a configuration file to {{Path|/etc/modprobe.d/}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/modprobe.d/usb_auto_suspend_disable.conf|1=
#This example disables USB power saving altogether
options usbcore autosuspend=-1
}}

== Tips ==

=== Become familiar with helpful tools ===

Many [[Software tools list|software tools]] and [[Hardware detection|hardware detection utilities]] are available in order to help troubleshoot a new Gentoo installation. Users who are knew to Gentoo have many options to choose from. Quite a few of the packages available in the Portage tree are utilities available on other Linux distributions. Other utilities are included on the Gentoo-based SystemRescueCD, which is a great distribution to use when installing or troubleshooting a Gentoo system.
