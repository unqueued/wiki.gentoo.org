The Lenovo Thinkpad W530 and its associated hardware components can be difficult to configure properly in Gentoo. This article is a configuration guide to help you work out some of the details in order to get your notebook working as it should be. Do not expect to have exactly the same hardware listed in this guide in your W530. The hardware listed here is to be used as an example. Some of the components might be similar, but there are always variants in computer manufacturing. 

== General Platform Notes ==

If you are using an SSD and you have a lot of RAM (16GB would be more than enough) you can expand the life of your SSD by caching your Portage temp directory completely in RAM:
{{file|/etc/fstab|Adding Portage temp directory to tmpfs:|
<pre>


</pre>
}}


== Kernel Configuration ==



In order to build your kernel properly use the <code>make menuconfig</code> command to start configure your kernel:
{{RootCmd|make menuconfig|}}

After configuration run these commands in this order to build and install your system's kernel and modules:
{{RootCmd|make|}}
{{RootCmd|make modules|}}
{{RootCmd|make install|}}
{{RootCmd|make modules_install|}}

== System Hardware ==

{{Important|As stated above, the hardware listed in the following commands might not match the hardware in your system verbatim.}}

{{RootCmd|lspci -nnk|output=<pre>

</pre>
}}

{{RootCmd|lsusb|output=<pre>

</pre>
}}


== X Display Configuration ==

=== Intel Graphics ===

This xorg.conf can make the integrated Intel GPU work properly:

{{file|/etc/X11/xorg.conf||
<pre>


</pre>
}}

=== Nouveau & Intel Graphics ===



=== NVidia Proprietary Graphics ===
