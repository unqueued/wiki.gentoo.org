|Gentoo support for oVirt - Engine|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
[http://www.ovirt.org/ oVirt] is a complete open sourced virtualization management platform working with KVM. ovirt-engine is the backend server that does the management, with client UI and RESTful API. Patches should be submitted to upstream oVirt projects, mainly ovirt-engine, to provide support to using Gentoo as operating system for the oVirt engine. This project includes the packaging of ovirt-engine itself and required dependencies.

Some initial packaging work:
