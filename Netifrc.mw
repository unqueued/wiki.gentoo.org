netifrc is a collection of modules created to configure and manage network interfaces via individual, per-interface scripts located in the {{Path|/etc/init.d/}} directory. In Gentoo Linux netifrc comes installed as part of the system profile. They can be uninstalled or simply not used in favorite of using another network manager.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

Since netifrc are simply a few scripts that integrate into OpenRC no USE flags exist for them.

=== Emerge ===

The netifrc modules come in standard stage3 tarballs so they should be already installed on the system. In the case they have been removed, they can be re-installed via:

{{Emerge|net-misc/netifrc||params+=--oneshot}}

== Configuration ==

=== Determine interface names ===

The first step in configuring netifrc is to get a list of the network interfaces present on the system. This is possible a couple different ways. The <tt>ifconfig</tt> command can be used to get a comprehensive list of available interfaces. It also be an used to detect if there is byte-activity on the interfaces which helps determine connectivity:

{{Cmd|ifconfig -a}}

For more information on <tt>ifconfig</tt> see the man page locally (<tt>man ifconfig</tt>) or [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ifconfig.8.html online].

Alternately, if <tt>[[dmesg]]</tt> is installed, a list of messages should be generated each time the system boots. Although the above method is better in practice, this approach can also be used to determine available network interfaces:

{{Cmd|<nowiki>dmesg | grep -i "network interface"</nowiki>}}

For more information on the use of <tt>dmesg</tt> see the man page locally (<tt>man dmesg</tt>) or [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html online].

{{Tip|If network interfaces cannot be discovered using the means above, but the physical system hardware indicates otherwise, it is likely the appropriate kernel drives for the network interface(s) have not been built for the currently running kernel or the system is lacking required firmware for interaction with the interface. Either the kernel will need to be configured to support the NIC driver and recompiled or the firmware will need to be installed; in some cases both changes will need to be performed For more information on how to perform these changes see the [[Kernel/Configuration|kernel configuration article]].}}

=== Adding interfaces ===

Provided in the {{Package|net-misc/netifrc}} package is a parent script called {{Path|net.lo}} which is installed to {{Path|/etc/init.d/net.lo}}. This parent script should be symlinked to create additional scripts for each network interface to be configured. For example, to create a script for a network interface called {{Path|eth0}}, run the following command:

{{RootCmd|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.lo /etc/init.d/net.<interface_name> }}

{{Tip|Use curly braces and commas to speed up the process when dealing with multiple interfaces:

{{RootCmd|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.{lo,<interface_name>} }} }}

Where <code><interface_name></code> in the example commands above is the appropriate name for the system's network interface: eno1, eth0, enp2s0, wlan0, ethernet0, wireless0, etc. Continue adding as many interfaces as needed. A system can have more than one interface connected to more than one network if the hardware is available.

Configuration of the interfaces is handled in the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}} file. A default (empty or missing) {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}} will automatically use DHCP to configure any network interface(s) started by {{Path|net.*}} scripts.
