netifrc is a collection of modules created to configure and manage network interfaces via individual, per-interface scripts located in the {{Path|/etc/init.d/}} directory. In Gentoo Linux netifrc comes installed as part of the system profile. They can be uninstalled or simply not used in favorite of using another network manager.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

Since netifrc are simply a few scripts that integrate into OpenRC no USE flags exist for them.

=== Emerge ===

The netifrc modules come in standard stage3 tarballs so they should be already installed on the system. In the case they have been removed, they can be re-installed via:

{{Emerge|net-misc/netifrc||params+=--oneshot}}

== Configuration ==

Provided in the {{Package|net-misc/netifrc}} package is a parent script called {{Path|net.lo}} which is installed to {{Path|/etc/init.d/net.lo}}. This parent script should be symlinked to create additional scripts for each network interface to be configured. For example, to create a script for a network interface called {{Path|eth0}}, run the following command:

{{RootCmd|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.lo /etc/init.d/net.${INTERFACE_NAME} }}

{{Tip|Use curly braces and commas to speed up the process when dealing with multiple interfaces:

{{RootCmd|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.{lo,${INTERFACE_NAME} } }} }}

where '''${INTERFACE_NAME}''' is the name of the network interface, e.g. eth0, wlan0, ethernet0, wireless0

Configuration of the interfaces is handled in the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}} file. A default (empty or missing) {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}} will automatically use DHCP to configure any network interfaces started by {{Path|net.*}} scripts.
