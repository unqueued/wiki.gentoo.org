netifrc is a collection of modules created to manage and configure network interfaces via individual per-interface scripts in {{Path|/etc/init.d}}. In Gentoo Linux netifrc comes installed by default as part of the system profile. They can be uninstalled or simply not used in favorite of using another network manager.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

Since netifrc are simply a few scripts that integrate into OpenRC no USE flags exist for them.

=== Emerge ===

The netifrc modules come in standard stage3 tarballs so they should be already installed on the system. In the case they have been removed, they can be re-installed via:

{{Emerge|net-misc/netifrc}}

== Configuration ==

Provided in the {{Package|net-misc/netifrc}} package is the a parent script called {{Path|net.lo}} (found in {{Path|/etc/init.d/net.lo}}) which should be symlinked to create additional scripts for each network interface to be configured. For example, to create a script for a network interface called {{Path|eth0}}, run the following command:

{{RootCmd|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.{lo,eth0} }}

Configuration of the interfaces is handled in the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}} file. A default (empty or missing) {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}} will automatically use DHCP to configure any network interfaces started by {{Path|net.*}} scripts.
