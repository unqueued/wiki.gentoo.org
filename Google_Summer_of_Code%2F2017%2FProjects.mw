"The goal of the project is to enable the user to efficiently manage a
local overlay (by adding new packages from external sources or
packages from the portage tree to make some edits, etc.)."

"Atom Gentoo, is the Idea which instantly caught my attention, and made
me decide to propose over, since I have always been interested to
further expand my knowledge on how Linux works, and more general, on the
fundamentals of operating systems."

"There are numerous MPI (Message Passing Interface) implementations available, but most of them can't be installed together as is. In HPC world it is often mandatory to provide for users different MPI implementations and/or versions of the same implementation, e.g. due to binary package dependencies, codebase or performance issues."
