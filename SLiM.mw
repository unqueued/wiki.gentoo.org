SLiM (Simple Login Manager) is a desktop-independent graphical login manager for X11. Being fast and having only a few dependencies, it is a popular choice amongst users of lightweight window managers. 

= Installation =
You can install SLiM using the following command:
{{Emerge|x11-misc/slim}}

Additional themes can also be installed:
{{Emerge|x11-themes/slim-themes}}


To make SLiM start automatically after boot, set the ''DISPLAYMANAGER'' in '''/etc/conf.d/xdm''' to ''slim'':
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
...
DISPLAYMANAGER="slim"
...
</pre>}}
You will also need to add xdm to the default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}


= Configuration =
All configuration is done in '''/etc/slim.conf'''


== Default configuration - no default session ==
By default, SLiM is configured to make all sessions in '''/etc/X11/Sessions/''' accessible -- you can cycle through them by pressing the '''F1''' key. This behavior is acquired by setting the options below:
{{File|/etc/slim.conf||<pre>
login_cmd            exec /bin/bash -login /usr/share/slim/Xsession %session
...
sessiondir           /etc/X11/Sessions
</pre>}}

When no other changes are made, users will need to press '''F1''' while logging-in to select the desired session. 
In following sections there are described several methods of setting one session as the default one.


== Setting a global default session ==
You can set a default session for all users of the computer, by setting the '''XSESSION''' variable. To do this, create and edit file '''/etc/env.d/90xsession'''
{{File|/etc/env.d/90xsession||<pre>
XSESSION="awesome"
</pre>}}
After saving the file run ''env-update'':
{{RootCmd|env-update}}


== Setting a default session for one user ==
Besides (or instead of) setting a global default session, you can let every user choose his default session. 

There are three approaches - you can either:
* use the SLiM session script ('''/usr/share/slim/Xsession''') to trigger session script from '''/etc/X11/Sessions/'''
* use the SLiM session script to trigger user-created session script
* force users to take care of setting everything by themselves

The first and second possibilities are generally preferred. However, if - for any reason - you do not want to set any defaults, you may choose the third approach. 


=== Per-user default session using bundled session files ===

The simplest way to set a default session for one user is to make a symbolic link from the session file to '''~/.xsession'''
{{Cmd|ln -s /etc/X11/Sessions/awesome ~/.xsession}}

An alternative is to put session command in the '''~/.xsession''' file:
{{File|~/.xsession||<pre>
/etc/X11/Sessions/awesome
</pre>}}
You will only need to make sure the file is executable:
{{Cmd|chmod u+x ~/.xsession}}


=== Per-user default session using only SLiM Xsession file ===


=== Per-user default session without using any default session files ===

== More tweaks ==
Theme selection is done by changing the following line:
{{File|/etc/slim.conf||<pre>
current-theme    slim-gentoo-simple
</pre>}}
You can easily find what themes are available on your system:
{{Cmd|ls /usr/share/slim/themes/}}


The NumLock key can be turned on or off by default:
{{File|/etc/slim.conf||<pre>
numlock    on
</pre>}}
