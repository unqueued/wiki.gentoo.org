SLiM (Simple Login Manager) is a desktop-independent graphical login manager for X11. Being fast and having only a few dependencies, it is a popular choice amongst users of lightweight window managers. 

= Installation =
You can install SLiM using the following command:
{{Emerge|x11-misc/slim}}

Additional themes can also be installed:
{{Emerge|x11-themes/slim-themes}}


To make SLiM start automatically after boot, set the ''DISPLAYMANAGER'' in '''/etc/conf.d/xdm''' to ''slim'':
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
...
DISPLAYMANAGER="slim"
...
</pre>}}
You will also need to add xdm to the default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}


= Configuration =
All configuration is done in '''/etc/slim.conf'''
{{Note|In the following paragraphs [[Awesome|Awesome WM]] is used as an example window manager.}}


== Default configuration - no default session ==
By default, SLiM is configured to make all sessions in '''/etc/X11/Sessions/''' accessible -- you can cycle through them by pressing the {{Key|F1}} key. This behavior is acquired by setting the options below:
{{File|/etc/slim.conf||<pre>
login_cmd            exec /bin/bash -login /usr/share/slim/Xsession %session
...
sessiondir           /etc/X11/Sessions
</pre>}}

When no other changes are made, users will need to press {{Key|F1}} while logging-in to select the desired session. 
In following sections there are described several methods of setting one session as the default one.


== Setting a global default session ==
You can set a default session for all users of the computer, by setting the '''XSESSION''' variable. To do this, create and edit file '''/etc/env.d/90xsession'''
{{File|/etc/env.d/90xsession||<pre>
XSESSION="awesome"
</pre>}}
After saving the file run ''env-update'':
{{RootCmd|env-update}}


== Setting a default session for one user ==
Besides (or instead of) setting a global default session, you can let every user choose his default session. 

There are three approaches - you can either:
* use the SLiM session script ('''/usr/share/slim/Xsession''') to trigger session script from '''/etc/X11/Sessions/'''
* use the SLiM session script to trigger user-created session script
* force users to take care of setting everything by themselves

The first and second possibilities are generally preferred. However, if - for any reason - you do not want to set any defaults, you may choose the third approach. 


=== Per-user default session using bundled session files ===

The simplest way to set a default session for one user is to make a symbolic link from the session file to '''~/.xsession'''
{{Cmd|ln -s /etc/X11/Sessions/awesome ~/.xsession}}


An alternative is to put session command in the '''~/.xsession''' file:
{{File|~/.xsession||<pre>
/etc/X11/Sessions/awesome
</pre>}}
You will only need to make sure the file is executable:
{{Cmd|chmod u+x ~/.xsession}}


=== Per-user default session using the customized ~/.xsession file ===

The default session triggered by '''/usr/share/slim/Xsession''' is '''/etc/X11/Sessions/Xsession''', which subsequently calls '''~/.xsession'''. Both '''Xsesssion''' files do some good and useful things (like reading '''~/.Xresources''' file and feeding xrdb with it), but they do not explicitly start any window manager. This way you can start some programs before the window manager itself, or start WM with a customized command.

To start your sessions this way, make sure you have no global default session set (or set XSESSION="Xsession" like described above). Then edit your '''~/.xsession''' file, putting your WM launcher at the end.

The file may look e.g. like this:
{{File|~/.xsession||<pre>
# Run urxvt daemon
urxvtd -q -o -f
# Set xserver parameters
xset s 0
xset dpms 0 0 1800
# Launch awesome
exec /usr/bin/awesome
</pre>}}

{{Note|You may look at the deafult WM session files in '''/etc/X11/Sessions''' to find "how things are done". Keep in mind, however, that the '''/etc/X11/Sessions/Xsession''' is sourced, so there is no need to duplicate entries from that file}}


=== Per-user default session without using any default session files ===

== More tweaks ==
Theme selection is done by changing the following line:
{{File|/etc/slim.conf||<pre>
current-theme    slim-gentoo-simple
</pre>}}
You can easily find what themes are available on your system:
{{Cmd|ls /usr/share/slim/themes/}}


The NumLock key can be turned on or off by default:
{{File|/etc/slim.conf||<pre>
numlock    on
</pre>}}
