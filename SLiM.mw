SLiM (Simple Login Manager) is a desktop-independent graphical login manager for X11.

== Installation ==
You can install SLiM using the following command:
{{Emerge|x11-misc/slim}}

Additional themes can also be installed:
{{Emerge|x11-themes/slim-themes}}


To make SLiM start automatically after boot, set the ''DISPLAYMANAGER'' in '''/etc/conf.d/xdm''' to ''slim'':
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
...
DISPLAYMANAGER="slim"
...
</pre>}}
You will also need to add xdm to the default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}


== Configuration ==
All configuration is done in '''/etc/slim.conf'''

By default, SLiM is configured to make all sessions in /etc/X11/Sessions/ accessible -- you can cycle through them by pressing the '''F1''' key. This behavior is acquired by setting the options below:
{{File|/etc/slim.conf||<pre>
login_cmd            exec /bin/bash -login /usr/share/slim/Xsession %session
...
sessiondir           /etc/X11/Sessions
</pre>}}

== More tweaks ==
Theme selection is done by changing the following line:
{{File|/etc/slim.conf||<pre>
current-theme    slim-gentoo-simple
</pre>}}
You can easily find what themes are available on your system:
{{Cmd|ls /usr/share/slim/themes/}}


The NumLock key can be turned on or off by default:
{{File|/etc/slim.conf||<pre>
numlock    on
</pre>}}
