On Saturday 2nd February and Sunday 3rd February 2019, the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting [https://fosdem.org/2019/ FOSDEM 2019] will take place in Brussels, Belgium.

Naturally a Gentoo crowd will be there; this page will collect public information about our presence, and help with organizing stuff.

== Gentoo stand ==

Gentoo will have a stand (but we don't know where yet, map and info to follow)

The following is an hour-by-hour schedule of who is running the stand. The plan is to have always two devs present, with overlapping two-hour slots (i.e., 10h-12h, 12h-14h, ... and 9h-11h, 11h-13h, 13h-15h, ...) (At start and end there are shorter slots, but these obviously also involve build-up and teardown.)

== Gentoo OpenPGP Web of Trust ==

Gentoo will not host a key signing party this year, but participants are encouraged to exchange and verify OpenPGP key data to build the Gentoo Web of Trust. Please bring printed information of the key fingerprint and various UIDs you want certified along with a valid governmental ID matching the UID. You can use a service like [https://openpgp.quelltextlich.at/slip.html openpgp.quelltextlich.at/slip.html] to generate such a key slip.
