== Gentoo dinner ==

=== Saturday ===

We'll meet (as every year) for the traditional Gentoo dinner on Saturday evening.


== Gentoo OpenPGP Web of Trust ==

Gentoo will not host a key signing party this year, but participants are encouraged to exchange and verify OpenPGP key data to build the Gentoo Web of Trust. Please bring printed information of the key fingerprint and various UIDs you want certified along with a valid governmental ID matching the UID. You can use a service like [http://openpgp.quelltextlich.at/slip.html] to generate such a key slip.
