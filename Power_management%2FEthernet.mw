This article describes the setup of [[power management]] of [[:Category:Network devices|Ethernet devices]].

== Disable Wake On LAN ==
With [[Wikipedia:Wake-on-LAN|Wake On LAN]] your network card will remain powered to monitor for a 'magic' packet that will instruct it to wake your computer.

To save some power WOL can be disabled.
{{Emerge|sys-apps/ethtool}}

The current setting can be checked with:
{{RootCmd|ethtool eth0 {{!}} grep -i wake| output=<pre>
        Supports Wake-on: pumbg
        Wake-on: g
</pre>}}

To disable:
{{RootCmd|ethtool -s eth0 wol d}}

=== BIOS ===
If you have an onboard device, you can most often disable WOL in the [[BIOS]].

=== ethtool ===
Add this string to /etc/conf.d/net file to disable WOL:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/net|lang=bash|1=
ethtool_change_eth0="wol d"
}}

== Throttle Gigabit-Ethernet ==
Gigabit-Ethernet needs more power than Fast-Ethernet. If you don't use the greater bandwidth, you can throttle your connection to Fast-Ethernet. For it install {{Package|sys-apps/ethtool}}:
{{Emerge|sys-apps/ethtool}}

Now you can throttle the connection:
{{RootCmd|ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off speed 100}}

If you want to always throttle the connection, add command to ethtool_change_''INTERFACE'' string in /etc/conf.d/net file.
