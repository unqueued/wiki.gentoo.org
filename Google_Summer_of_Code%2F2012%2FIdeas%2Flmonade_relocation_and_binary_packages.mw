|lmonade relocation and binary packages|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 

The [http://www.lmona.de lmonade] project is essentially a distribution of mathematical software based on [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/ Gentoo prefix]. This distribution can be installed without admistrative rights on different linux distributions or OSX.

For a user not familiar with Unix and the shell, the quickest solution to get a working copy of some software is to download a binary. Unfortunately, from the software developers point of view, the problem of binary distribution is hard to solve due to all the different flavors of GNU/Linux distributions or OSX.
Portage supports binary packages and Gentoo-prefix can handle basic rewriting of absolute paths encoded in binaries present in these packages. Though there are still [[#Improved_binary_package_support|quite a few rough edges]] that require attention before this can be used in production.

The goal of this project is to bring all these pieces together to form a polished, easy to use solution that will be useful to many software projects. The focus will be on getting something working instead of finding the right solution to every problem.
This task would involve 
* modifying eclasses to generate relocatable files, 
* writing scripts to fix absolute paths in binaries (e.g., [http://hg.sagemath.org/scripts-main/file/78a0b42fab1f/sage-make_relative 1] [http://hg.sagemath.org/scripts-main/file/78a0b42fab1f/sage-location 2]),
* package everything in a user friendly format and
* testing on lots of platforms.
