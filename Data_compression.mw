! scope="col" width="10%" | Name !! scope="col" width="20%" | Package !! Description
|-
| [[bzip2]] || {{Package|app-arch/bzip2}} || A high-quality data compressor that used to be the primary compression format used in distributing source code. It is slowly losing ground to the newer, tightly packable xz format.
|-
| [[gzip]] || {{Package|app-arch/gzip}} || The Standard GNU compressor. One of the oldest of the group, has less compression than bzip2 format.
|-
| [[tar]] || {{Package|app-arch/tar}}|| GNU's tarball generator software used extensively by Gentoo Linux. tar has the ability to create {{Path|.gz}}, {{Path|.bz2}}, and {{Path|.xz}} compression by passing different options. This is one tool all Linux users should have in their tool belt.
|-
| [[xz]]|| {{Package|app-arch/xz-utils}} || Includes utilities for managing LZMA compressed files.
|-
| [[zip]] || {{Package|app-arch/zip}} || Provides classic zip compression (this flavor created by Info ZIP). Nice for cross-platform compatibility with Microsoft operating systems. Must be built with the <code>crypt</code> USE flag in order to support encryption. Also supports the <code>unicode</code> USE flag.
