PowerTOP is a Linux utility that can monitor and display a system's electrical power usage. It is useful as a hardware monitoring and diagnostic tool. It is among the most powerful battery stretching utilities for notebook computers.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Both <code>CPU_FREQ_STAT</code> and <code>CPU_FREQ_STAT_DETAILS</code> must be enabled in the kernel for PowerTOP to work properly. Enabling <code>CPU_FREQ_STAT_DETAILS</code> might be a good idea as well.

{{KernelBox|title=Enable support for PowerTOP in kernel|1=
Power management and ACPI options  --->
   CPU Frequency scaling  --->
      [*] CPU Frequency scaling
      <*> CPU frequency translation statistics
      [*] CPU frequency translation statistics details
}}

If the above options have not properly been enabled Portage should display warning messages at the end of the emerge.
