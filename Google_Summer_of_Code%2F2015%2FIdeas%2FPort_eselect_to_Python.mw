|Port eselect to Python|
Eselect is currently using Bash, which was hit by Shellshock and other vulnerabilities last year. Gentoo Developer Flameeyes [https://blog.flameeyes.eu/2014/09/what-does-shellshock-mean-for-gentoo suggested on his weblog] to convert eselect to Python, as Bash is not a proper programming language.<br /><br />This task alone might not be enough for a complete Summer of Code project, but might be combined with the Gentoolkit rewriting to Python and the gcc-config part of Clang native support (think of integrating the improved gcc-config as a Python eselect module).|
