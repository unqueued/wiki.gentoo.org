This page intends to organize required actions to prepare the [http://google-opensource.blogspot.de/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html announced] shutdown of google code.

https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=544092


== List of packages ==

{{Cmd|qgrep -N googlecode.com {{!}} grep "URI{{=}}" {{!}} grep -v "^#" {{!}} cut -f1 -d":"}}

or use the md5 cache

{{Cmd|HERE{{=}}`pwd`; cd /usr/portage/metadata/md5-cache; grep "URI{{=}}" -R {{!}} grep "googlecode\.com"; cd $HERE}}

== Security ==
Many projects got forked several times during the shut down procedure and it is not always easy to find out which fork is the right one for  the gentoo ebuild.
While many packages need an update to a new URL it is easy to plant silently a link to malicious source code instead of the original source 
code. It is also possible that a gentoo developer uses a wrong fork by accident.

== Brainstorming ==
* first step, just 'clone' all SRC_URI to a random webserver, and fix the current one to point at it
* second step, figure out if the project has moved or has been frozen

== Statistics ==
In the case of [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=494678 BerliOS] it took about one year to fix 50 % of the ebuilds. Perhaps it is interesting to keep some statistics:

  # date NumberOfEbuilds
  2016-10-28 529


Command to collect date and number of packages with googlecode in the *URI variable:
{{Cmd|echo $(date --iso) $(grep "URI{{=}}.*googlecode\.com.*" -R /usr/portage/metadata/md5-cache {{!}} wc -l)}}

== Other repositories that were shut down ==
