== List of packages ==

{{Cmd|qgrep -N googlecode.com {{!}} grep "URI{{=}}" {{!}} grep -v "^#" {{!}} cut -f1 -d":"}}

== Security ==
Many projects got forked several times during the shut down procedure and it is not always easy to find out which fork is the right one for  the gentoo ebuild.
While many packages need an update to a new URL it is easy to plant silently a link to malicious source code instead of the original source code. It is also possible that a gentoo developer uses a wrong fork by accident. 

== Other repositories that were shut down ==
