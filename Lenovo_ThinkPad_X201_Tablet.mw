 ''Initial creation of the Lenovo ThinkPad X201 Tablet article. Show it some love by improving it!''

(Introductory paragraph goes here. Describe the hardware. It is okay to mention the hardware platforms friendliness to open source drivers. Optionally, it is nice provide a nice summary of why or why not a user would want to buy this hardware for use with Linux.)
