(Write the necessary steps to get Gentoo onto this system. Try to document any special step that each user will need to reproduce on their system. Includes getting special drivers or firmware from a manufacturer website, etc.)

=== Firmware ===

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}

=== Kernel ===

(Show what options are necessary in the kernel in order to get all device components functional for this hardware platform.)

{{KernelBox|title=ACPI|1=

=== Emerge ===

(Optional section. If the platform requires any user space packages or kernel patches, mention them here).

Touchscreen requires [[#Finger/Pen Input|inputtattach]] program from the following package.
{{Emerge|games-util/joystick}}

Fingerprint reader is recognized by the following library.
{{Emerge|sys-auth/libfprint}}

== Configuration ==

(Explain any additional configuration or special customization for this hardware platform. Could be anything from BIOS settings to assigning proper media key functionality.)

=== Finger/Pen Input ===

The following program has to be running for the functionality to work.
{{RootCmd|inputattach -w8001 /dev/ttyS0}}


For [[X11]] to work with finger/pen input, pull in {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-input-wacom}} by inserting <code>wacom</code> argument into the indicated variable in the file shown below and run the following command for the configuration to emerge.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|1=
INPUT_DEVICES="... wacom"
}}{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --deep --newuse @world}}

=== Example 1 ===

(Example: Do this in order to get these keys working.)

== Troubleshooting ==

(Optional section.)

(Troubleshoot issues in this section. Separate issues by best describing the error with a new section name. Remove this section and subsections if no issues are known.)

=== Issue 1 ===

When X happens, Y is how you fix it.

== See also ==

(Optional section.)

* [[Article_name]] - (Link to related Gentoo Wiki articles using bullet points for each link in this section; each link should be local to the Wiki. Use a dash to separate the link from a reason why the link was decided upon.)

== External resources ==
