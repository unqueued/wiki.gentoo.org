이 안내서에서는 강력한 명령행 전자메일 클라이언트 mutt 사용을 어떻게 시작하는지 보여드리겠습니다.

== Mutt 전자메일 클라이언트 ==

멋진 그래픽 사용자 인터페이스로 치장된 전자메일 클라이언트에 관심이 없거나 SSH 연결로 메일만 재빠르게 읽으려 한다면 콘솔 기반 메일 클라이언트 종류가 해당이 될지 모르겠습니다. 

Mutt는 아직도 활발히 개발중인 현재 콘솔 기반의 메일 클라언트중 하나이며, 엄청나게 많은 활동 지원자(그리고 사용자)가 있습니다. 강력하고, 이리저리 설정할 수 있으며, 작고 효율적입니다. 

Mutt는 처음에 로컬 mbox 메일 스풀(예: {{Path|/var/spool/mail/}} )로부터 메일을 읽는 용도로 설계했지만, 오늘날에는 폴더에 저장하는 Maildir을 지원하고, POP3 서버로부터 원격 가져오기가 가능하며, IMAP의 완벽한 관리가 됩니다. Mutt가 무얼 할 수 있는지에 대한 전체 설명을 보시려면 [http://www.mutt.org/ http://www.mutt.org/] Mutt 웹 사이트에 있는 Mutt 설명서를 보십시오. 

== Mutt 요청하기 ==

Mutt에 대한 모험을 시작하는데는 그냥 이머지 동작만 필요합니다. 애석하게도 Mutt에 각각의 기능을 활성화 하거나 비활성화 할 옵션이 꽤 많습니다. 이제 Mutt를 사용하겠다는 사실을 기반으로 하여 여러분이 원하는 기능을 활성화 하는 중요한 USE 플래그에 대해 이야기해보도록 하겠습니다. 참고로 대부분의 기능을 활성화 하는건 Mutt에 문제가 되지 않겠지만 Mutt 사용자가 이미 경험했고 좋아할 그 이상의 기능을 넣게 될지도 모릅니다. 

{{RootCmd|emerge -pv mutt|output=<pre>
[ebuild     N ] mail-client/mutt-1.5.21-r1 USE="gdbm gpg imap mbox nls nntp \
                  sidebar smime smtp ssl -berkdb -crypt -debug -doc -gnutls \
                  -idn -pop -qdbm -sasl -tokyocabinet"
</pre>
}}

처음 사용하시는 분들께는 아마도 <code>imap</code> USE 플래그가 가장 중요한게 아닌가 싶습니다. 이 플래그를 활성화 하면 그 어떤 문제로도 괴로워 하지 아니할 것이기에, Mutt로 사용할 계정이 어떤 방식인지 모르겠다면 그냥 활성화 하십시오. GMail같은 무료 서비스를 제공하는 대부분의 전자메일 서비스 제공 회사에서는 오늘날 각기 다른 장소에서 동시에 여러 클라이언트에서 전자메일을 살펴볼 수 있도록 저장하는 간편한 수단인 IMAP 방식을 사용합니다. IMAP은 서버의 메일을 그대로 두기 때문에 Mutt에서는 보고자 하는 메시지만 다운로드합니다. 

Often you happen to jump through a couple of messages a couple of times shortly after each other, which would require to download the same message over and over again. Since this simply is a waste, Mutt uses a so-called header cache (hcache) to keep the most important bits of messages that it needs. This hcache is backed by a db-library, of which four flavours exist: <code>gdbm</code> , <code>berkdb</code> , <code>qdbm</code> and <code>tokyocabinet</code> . If you don't have any preference yourself, pick gdbm or berkdb. Most likely you will have both already installed on your system. Enabling the USE-flags for more than one hcache backend will make Mutt choose one it likes best. It will always use at most one. 

While IMAP is important for reading mail, sending mail requires a mail server. Mutt can talk to a mail server that exists on the local system, but often that's not the case, or simply not a good solution for e.g. laptop users that often travel around. Mutt comes with SMTP support which gets enabled by the <code>smtp</code> USE-flag. Again, enabling it if you're not sure doesn't harm. Mutt's SMTP support allows you just to send mail over a mail server of your choice; usually the one that you are given by your email provider. 

Both IMAP and SMTP mostly go over encrypted channels these days, hence if you enabled any of both, it is wise to also enable either of the <code>ssl</code> or <code>gnutls</code> USE-flags. Both just add the secure variants (imaps and smtps) to Mutt's list of supported protocols using either OpenSSL's or GNUTLS' implementation. If you don't have a strong preference for either, just go for <code>ssl</code> . Most likely this is in your global USE already anyway. If you intend to authenticate yourself when sending e-mail, be sure to also include <code>sasl</code> in your USE-flags, since that's a prerequisite for that. 

Last but not least, there is the <code>sidebar</code> USE-flag. It enables an extension to Mutt that can show a navigation pane of available mailboxes on the left hand side of the screen. While this is not a recommended feature for absolute newcomers (it is nowhere mentioned in any official docs, since it simply isn't official), more experienced users might like its functionality. Luckily, just enabling the USE-flag doesn't make it visible at all, meaning you don't even notice it's enabled. 

== Mutt 설정 ==

After you emerged mutt with your USE-flags of choice, the only necessary step is to create a {{Path|.muttrc}} file in your home directory. Muttrc's are to be found in many places on the web and in Mutt's documentation. In {{Path|/usr/share/doc/mutt-<version>/samples}} you can find some muttrc samples that are from the official distribution. We discuss a very minimal {{Path|.muttrc}} for an IMAP based account with SMTP mail delivery below. 

{{File|~/.muttrc|.muttrc 예제 파일|<pre>

{{Note|It is good practice to review all settings from the example above. There are many more, and some preferences may actually not match yours. Keep that in mind when you feel that Mutt at first doesn't really work the way you like.}}

The example {{Path|.muttrc}} above sets up an IMAP account, uses an SMTP server to send mail, stores its cache in {{Path|/var/tmp/.mutt}} , reads the known address aliases (think of it as an address book) from {{Path|~/.aliases}} and appends the signature from {{Path|~/.signature}} when composing new mail. For some IMAP servers it may be necessary to change the spool, record and postponed directories, as the folders {{Path|Sent}} and {{Path|Drafts}} may be under a folder called {{Path|INBOX}} . Simply trying this out with Mutt is the simplest way to figure this out. 

Once your {{Path|.muttrc}} is setup, you are ready to launch Mutt by just running <code>mutt</code> . If you entered a valid IMAP server url, Mutt will prompt you for your password and afterwards load all messages for you. Note that the first time entering your mailbox may take a while if you have quite some messages, since Mutt's header cache is still empty. If this succeeds you're in your IMAP mailbox ready to go. 

Navigation is intuitive, as is reading messages by just pressing the enter key or space bar. Mutt is quite Vim alike in that it uses key strokes to perform most of its actions. You best read Mutt's manual on the web to get yourself known with all existing functions (or press ? in Mutt) and what key they are bound to, or better, what key you like it to be bound to. Some essential keys are <code>m</code> (for message) to start composing a new message, <code>q</code> for quit, <code>r</code> for reply, <code>s</code> for save and <code>p</code> for print. 

One of the features that Mutt has that is still not in today's most savvy email clients is the ability to display attachments inline through some viewer. The auto_view directive in the .muttrc file tells Mutt which attachments (based on their MIME-type) it should view inline. To figure out how to do that, Mutt uses mailcap files to lookup how to display a certain MIME-type. Usually the system wide mailcap file isn't sufficient here, so you better start a {{Path|~/.mailcap}} file to put items in there for <code>copiousoutput</code> that Mutt can display inline. 

In the example {{Path|.muttrc}} above <code>auto_view</code> is enabled for <code>application/msword</code> and <code>application/pdf</code> files. These two show the extreme usefulness of this capability, because it means meeting notes sent as doc file now are perfectly fine readable without having to save the attachment and open it in LibreOffice. Instead the text just shows up in the message reader, that is, if you have a matching entry in your {{Path|~/.mailcap}} file.

{{File|~/.mailcap|.mailcap 예제 파일|<pre>
application/msword; antiword '%s'; copiousoutput; description=Word Document;
nametemplate=%s.doc
application/pdf; pdftotext '%s' -; copiousoutput; description=PDF Document;
nametemplate=%s.pdf
</pre>
}}

The above {{Path|.mailcap}} example tells mutt what to do to "view" <code>msword</code> and <code>pdf</code> files. For the former it should run a program called <code>antiword</code> (emerge <code>app-text/antiword</code> ), for the latter the program <code>pdftotext</code> (emerge <code>app-text/poppler</code> ). You can go wild with these to for example display rendered HTML (give <code>app-text/vilistextum</code> a try), render vcards, or show ASCII representation of attached images. All you need to do is define how to call the program in your {{Path|.mailcap}} , and tell Mutt to try to view it inline using the <code>auto_view</code> directive. 

== 마무리 ==

Mutt is a very versatile console email client. If you like the concept, Mutt can be altered to behave in nearly any way through its configuration. Search the web to find others explaining how they did "it", or find one of the many patches that exist to make Mutt do even more. Gentoo applies a couple of very popular patches to Mutt, so make sure to check <code>mutt -v</code> if you want something more to make sure it is not yet already at your disposal. While learning Mutt is not necessarily easy, once it is in your fingers, it can make your mail experience much faster and efficient than with other clients. Searching for example is quite powerful if you know how to hit the right flags and know which regular expression narrows your search down. Enjoy Mutting!
