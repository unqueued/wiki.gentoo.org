== Touchpad ==
=== Kernel ===
==== Finding the good modules names ====
A Devuan Live Session was used to debug the issue,because the Touchpad was perfectly working on that session.
===== Step 1: Find the needed modules names =====
To find the used module names, a trial and error way was used, the idea is to find all loaded modules and unload them one by one to see if the Touchpad behavior changes.
Because we can't unload the modules used by other modules we'll only unload the unused ones.
{{CodeBox|lang=bash|<nowiki>
#!/usr/bin/env bash
for  MOD in $(lsmod | awk '$3 ~ 0 {print $1}' | sort -h);
 do echo "$MOD";
 sudo modprobe -r "$MOD"; echo "Reload $MOD?";
 read -r ANS;
 test "$ANS" = "y" && sudo modprobe "$MOD";
 done
</nowiki>
 }}
Based on this method, the needed modules are:
{{CodeBox|1=hid_multitouch
i2c_designware_platform
i2c_hid
intel_lpss_pci
}}
===== Step 2: Find the modules that are using those modules =====
To find the other used modules by the Touchpad we can use the below commands:
{{Cmd|1=lsmod {{!}} grep -E "hid_multitouch{{!}}i2c_designware_platform{{!}}i2c_hid{{!}}intel_lpss_pci"
|output=<pre>
 intel_lpss_pci
 intel_lpss
 i2c_hid
 i2c_designware_platform
 i2c_designware_core
 hid_multitouch
 hid
</pre>
}}
