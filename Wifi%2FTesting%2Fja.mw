After a reboot with the new kernel or after loading the modules, the device can be checked for availability by using following methods:
* Using the [[#.2Fsys_file_system|{{Path|/sys}} file system]]
* Using the [[#ip command|{{c|ip}} command]]
* Using the [[#ifconfig command|{{c|ifconfig}} command]]
* Using the [[#iw command|{{c|iw}} command]]

=== /sys file system ===

{{:Sysfs/network devices/en}}

=== ip command ===

To obtain the device name and verify that the wireless card is detected, execute the following [[Iproute2|{{c|ip}} command]]:

{{Cmd|ip addr|output=<pre>
3: wlan0:   ...
</pre>}}

=== ifconfig command === 

The {{c|ifconfig}} command is provided through the {{package|sys-apps/net-tools}} package. Use {{c|ifconfig -a}} to list all detected network cards, even those that are not enabled/active yet:

{{Cmd|ifconfig -a|output=<pre>
wlan0     ...
</pre>}}

A network card can be activated as follows:

{{RootCmd|ifconfig -v wlan0 up|output=<pre>
SIOCSIFFLAGS: Operation not possible due to RF-kill
WARNING: at least one error occurred. (-1)
</pre>}}

In this example, enabling the wireless card failed as a radio frequency kill state is set (usually to keep power consumption at bay and not connect by accident to a wireless network).

=== iw command ===

If the wireless network card driver supports the nl80211 stack, then the {{c|iw}} command as offered by the {{Package|net-wireless/iw}} package can show the detected wireless cards:

{{RootCmd|iw dev|output=<pre>
   phy#0
	Interface wlan0
		ifindex 4
		type managed
</pre>}}
