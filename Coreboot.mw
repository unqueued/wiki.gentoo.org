'''Coreboot''' is a free and opensource firmware which aims to be fast, secure and flexible replacement for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface UEFI]. 
In this guide you will learn how to install coreboot on supported devices, handling of userspace tools and the use of flashrom.

== Supported Hardware ==
There are different types of architectures and supported hardware. If you want to take a look at the full table, please follow this [http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Motherboards link]. In the table below you can find well supported devices which are more or less new devices. If you want to use older laptop's which are blob free, use the [http://libreboot.org/ libreboot] guide.

== The Basics ==
In general you begin to find the spi chip on the board of your selected hardware. This is important because of the vendor which locks the spi via soft lockdown. 

=== Flasher ===
As flasher you can easily use a Raspberry PI B+ or v2 with a [http://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/Pomona-Electronics/5250/?qs=q2OAyjihNMzqkARxZuX5AQ%3D%3D pomona SOIC-8 testclip] for 40€. But there also many other [http://flashrom.org/Supported_programmers programmers].

=== SPI flash ===

There are different types of SPI chips ([http://flashrom.org/Supported_hardware list]). The most common package for these chips is SOIC-8 which can be flashed via testclip. Sometimes you will find chips with a WSON-8 package, then you need to desolder the WSON-8 chip and resolder a new SOIC-8. If you need help with soldering ask [https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_Hacker_Spaces hackerspaces] near your location. SPI chips are common in sizes from 2MB - 16MB. Often vendors solder two chips to save money. A flash chip contains a flash descriptor that can be seen as a partition table for the SPI flash with some additional properties.

Now you will install flashrom on your system.
