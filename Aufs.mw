Another Union File System ('''Aufs''') is an advanced multi-layered unification filesystem. Aufs was originally a re-design and re-implementation of the popular [[UnionFS]], however after adding many new original ideas it became entirely separate from UnionFS. '''Aufs''' is considered a UnionFS alternative as it supports many of the same features. Currently '''Aufs''' is in version 3.

__TOC__

== Features ==
* The ability to unite several directories into a single virtual filesystem. Calling the member directory as a branch;
* Specification of the permission flags on each branch (readonly, readwrite, and whiteout-able);
* Via upper writable branch, internal copyup and whiteout is possible (files and directories on the readonly branch are logically modifiable);
* Dynamic branch manipulation (add, delete, etc.).

== Installation ==
There are two ways to obtain support for aufs in the kernel.
# Emerge '''aufs3 patch set'''. This will download and install aufs support to the ''existing'' kernel allowing the user to keep using the ''same'' kernel.
# Emerge the '''pre-patched aufs kernel'''. This will download and install a new aufs kernel to {{Path|/usr/src/linux}} The kernel will then need to be (re)configured.

If the system has an old kernel and aufs support is needed, then it might be best to choose the second option, however the package might need to be unmasked. If the system already has an up to date kernel, then the first option will probably work out better.

Currently, the Aufs3 package ({{Package|sys-fs/aufs3}}) is the only version of '''Aufs''' in the Portage tree. For anything older than 3.x, search the net. Why would anyone desire to use an older version?!

From here on out, this article will suppose the first option ({{Package|sys-fs/aufs3}}) was chosen. See [[Kernel/Overview#aufs-sources|the aufs-sources entry in the kernel overview]] for more information concerning the {{Package|sys-kernel/aufs-sources}} package.

To install the '''Aufs''' patch-set run:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/aufs3}}

{{Important|'''Aufs3''' will not emerge properly unless there is an existing {{Path|.config}} file in the system's current kernel directory. When upgrading kernels, be sure the old {{Path|.config}} is copied to the new kernel's directory before emerging this package. For more information on kernel configuration see the [[Kernel/Configuration|kernel configuration page]].}

There are several '''USE''' flag options for Aufs:
{{USEflag
|debug
|doc
|fuse+++Enables fuse support
|hfs+++Enables hfs support
|inotify
|kernel-patch+++Patch the current kernel for aufs3 support
|nfs+++Enable support for nfs export
|pax_kernel+yes++Apply patch needed for pax enabled kernels
|ramfs+++Enable initramfs/rootfs support
}}

== Configuration ==
In order to work with Aufs, the {{Package|sys-fs/aufs-util}} package is needed; utilities are always necessary for Aufs:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/aufs-util}}

===Kernel configuration ===

Aufs must be enabled in the kernel.
