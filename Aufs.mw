'''Aufs''' ('''A'''nother '''U'''nion '''F'''ile '''S'''ystem) is [[Article description::an advanced multi-layered unification filesystem.]] Aufs was originally a re-design and re-implementation of the popular [[UnionFS]], however after adding many new original ideas it became entirely separate from UnionFS. Aufs is considered a UnionFS alternative since it supports many of the same features.

__TOC__

== Features ==

* The ability to unite several directories into a single virtual filesystem. Calling the member directory as a branch;
* Specification of the permission flags on each branch (readonly, readwrite, and whiteout-able);
* Via upper writable branch, internal copyup and whiteout is possible (files and directories on the readonly branch are logically modifiable);
* Dynamic branch manipulation (add, delete, etc.)

== Installation ==

Emerge the pre-patched ({{Package|sys-kernel/aufs-sources}}) package. This will install another set of kernel sources that have had the Aufs4 patches applied. The new sources will show up in {{Path|/usr/src}} using a ''aufs'' suffixed name scheme.

If aufs sources are not yet emerged on the system, do so presently:

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/aufs-sources}}

After the {{c|emerge}} process is finished, list the available sources:

{{RootCmd|eselect kernel list|output=<pre>
  [1]   linux-4.14.91-gentoo
  [2]   linux-4.14.91-aufs
</pre>}}

Use {{c|eselect}} to set the symlink to the aufs kernel sources:

{{RootCmd|eselect kernel set 2}}

=== Kernel configuration ===

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling support for Aufs|1=
File systems  --->
   Miscellaneous filesystems  --->
      [*] Aufs (Advanced multi layered unification filesystem) support
            Maximum number of branches (127)  --->
      [*]   Detect direct branch access (bypassing aufs)
              method (fsnotify)  --->
      [ ]   NFS-exportable aufs
      [*]   support for XATTR/EA (including Security Labels)
      [*]   File-based Hierarchical Storage Management
      [ ]   Readdir in userspace
      [ ]   Workaround for rename(2)-ing a directory
      [ ]   Show whiteouts
      [*]   Ramfs (initramfs/rootfs) as an aufs branch
      [ ]   Debug aufs
}}

After the features have been set, build the kernel:

{{RootCmd|make}}

{{Note|Depending on the speed of the CPU(s) available, building the kernel could take a while. If the number of CPU cores in the system are known the <code>-jN</code> (where <code>N</code> is a number) option can be used to speed up the complication process. See the [[Kernel/Configuration#Build|build section of the manual kernel configuration article]] for more information.}}

== Configuration ==

In order to work with Aufs, the {{Package|sys-fs/aufs-util}} package is needed; utilities are always necessary for Aufs. This packages should be pulled in when emerging {{Package|sys-kernel/aufs-sources}}. In the case that it is not, run:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/aufs-util}}

== Usage ==

Check {{c|[http://aufs.sourceforge.net/aufs4/man.html man aufs]}}
