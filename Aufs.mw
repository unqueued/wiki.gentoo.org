Another Union File System (Aufs) is an advanced multi-layered unification filesystem. Aufs was originally a re-design and re-implementation of the popular [[UnionFS]], however after adding many new original ideas it became entirely separate from UnionFS. Aufs is considered a UnionFS alternative as it supports many of the same features. Currently Aufs is in version 3.

'''Features'''
* The ability to unite several directories into a single virtual filesystem. Calling the member directory as a branch.
* Specification of the permission flags on each branch (readonly, readwrite, and whiteout-able.)
* Via upper writable branch, internal copyup and whiteout is possible (files and directories on the readonly branch are logically modifiable).
* Dynamic branch manipulation (add, delete, etc.).

__TOC__

== Installation ==
Currently, the Aufs3 ({{Package|sys-fs/aufs3}}) package is the only version of '''Aufs''' in the Portage tree.

{{Emerge|sys-fs/aufs3}}

Alternatively, it is possible to emerge the {{Package|sys-kernel/aufs-sources}} in order to build a kernel with the Genpatchset and aufs3 support already applied:

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/aufs-sources}}

See [[Kernel/Overview#aufs-sources|the aufs-sources entry in the kernel overview]] for more information.

There are several '''USE''' flag options for Aufs:
{{USEflag
|debug
|doc
|fuse+++Enable fuse support
|hfs+++Enable hfs support
|inotify
|kernel-patch+++Patch the current kernel for aufs3 support
|nfs+++Enable support for nfs export
|pax_kernel+yes++Apply patch needed for pax enabled kernels
|ramfs+++Enable initramfs/rootfs support
}}
