Gentoo is able to run smoothly on this hardware, however it is recommended to SPEND some time in the BIOS to know its hardware and get familiar with is names.


== Hardware ==

The following is the hardware as listed by BIOS. '''It is strongly recommended that you update the BIOS before installing Gentoo''' , there is an option to update it without the need to install an operative system, you just need to adjust network settings inside BIOS.

* System Board ID: 2216
* BIOS Version: M71 Ver. 01.27
* Bios Release Date: July 12th 2018
* BIOS Revision: INTEL(R) VBIOS (5.5.1040)
* Processor Type: Intel Core i7-5600U 
* Processor Speed: 2.60 GHz
* Memory Size: 8192 MB RAM
* Memory Slot Information: 2x Samsung 4096 MB RAM @ 1600 MHz
* HDD Model: SanDisk SD7SB2Q-512G-1006
* HDD Size: 512GB
* WLAN
* Bluetooth
* Ethernet



== BIOS ==
Inside BIOS there are three "Boot Modes" available:
# Legacy
# UEFI Hybrid (With CSM)
# UEFI Native (Without CSM)
:
For some unknown reason I wasn't able to boot Linux in "Legacy mode", internet pointed out that may be related to HDD Model listed in section above, so I selected "UEFI Hybrid" and it could be booted correctly.  
You just need to take note that "UEFI Hybrid"  allows you to have MBR/DOS partition layout.

== Partition Layout ==

As stated in the previous version, installation was done using MBR/DOS partition layout. If using such layout, it is recommended that first partition starts at sector 2048
