{{c|shellinabox}} [[Article description::allows access to the command-line from web based terminal emulator.]] It is useful for web-based administrator access to a system. It is accessible to any JavaScript and CSS enabled web browser and does not require any additional browser plugins.<ref>https://code.google.com/archive/p/shellinabox/</ref>. shellinabox is not secured by default unless SSL/TLS certificates have been installed or generated.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

== Configuration ==

=== Securing the connection ===

The default configuration exposes a login shell with SSL disabled on the localhost interface only.

Information about the procedure for generating self-signed SSL certificates is [https://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/issues/detail?id=59#c15 explained here].

To generate an SSH certification for use shellinabox the following commands can be issued:

{{RootCmd
|cd /etc/shellinabox/cert
|openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
|openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
|cp server.key server.key.org
|openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
|openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
|cat server.crt server.key > certificate.pem
}}

For Gentoo user convenience, the ebuild maintainer has provided the above commands in a file located here: {{Path|/etc/shellinabox/cert/gen_ssl_cert.bash}}

This script can simply be executed in order to generate the SSL certificate:

{{RootCmd
|cd /etc/shellinabox/cert
|bash gen_ssl_cert.bash
}}

=== Files ===

* {{Path|/etc/global_file_example}} - Global (system wide) configuration file.
* {{Path|~/.local_file_example}} - Local (per user) configuration file.

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

Add the service to the default runlevel

{{RootCmd|rc-update add shellinaboxd default}}

Start the service now:

{{RootCmd|rc-service shellinaboxd start}}

== Usage ==
