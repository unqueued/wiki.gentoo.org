upmpdcli is [[Article description::a free and open source UPnP media renderer front-end for Music Player Daemon (MPD).]] It allows MPD to be controlled with a UPnP control point (e.g. [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1118891 BubbleUPnP]). upmpdcli also allows a single UPnP library to be shared between UPnP control points/renderers and MPD, meaning MPD can be run without a database.

== Prerequisites ==

This article assumes that [[MPD]] and a UPnP media server such as [[Gerbera]] have been previously configured.

== Installation ==

=== USE Flags ===

{{USEflag|package=media-sound/upmpdcli}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|media-sound/upmpdcli}}

== Configuration ==

Below is a snippet of the default upmpdcli configuration file. Options prefixed with <code>#</code> are commented out because they are set to default values. The options that need to be set are <code>upnpiface</code> or <code>upnpip</code> and <code>mpdhost</code>. If the UPnP or MPD ports have been changed from their defaults, then <code>upnpport</code> and <code>mpdport</code> should be set accordingly.
