upmpdcli is [[Article description::a free and open source UPnP media renderer front-end for Music Player Daemon (MPD).]] It allows MPD to be controlled with a UPnP control point (e.g. [https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1118891 BubbleUPnP]). upmpdcli also allows a single UPnP library to be shared between UPnP control points/renderers and MPD, meaning MPD can be run without a database.

== Prerequisites ==

This article assumes that [[MPD]] and a UPnP media server such as [[Gerbera]] have been previously configured.

== Installation ==

=== USE Flags ===

{{USEflag|package=media-sound/upmpdcli}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|media-sound/upmpdcli}}

== Configuration ==

Below is a snippet of the default upmpdcli configuration file. Options prefixed with <code>#</code> are commented out because they are set to default values. The options that need to be set are <var>upnpiface</var> or <var>upnpip</var> and <var>mpdhost</var>. If the UPnP or MPD ports have been changed from their defaults, then <var>upnpport</var> and <var>mpdport</var> should be set accordingly.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/upmpdcli.conf|1=
# upmpdcli general parameters
#logfilename = /var/log/upmpdcli.log
#loglevel = 2
#pkgdatadir=/usr/share/upmpdcli
#pidfile = /var/run/upmpdcli.pid

# upnp network parameters
#upnpiface =
upnpip = 192.168.0.1
#upnpport =

# media renderer parameters
#friendlyname = UpMpd
#upnpav = 1
#openhome = 1
#lumincompat = 0
#saveohcredentials = 1
#checkcontentformat = 1
#iconpath = /usr/share/upmpdcli/icon.png
#cachedir = /var/cache/upmpdcli
#presentationhtml = /usr/share/upmpdcli/presentation.html

# mpd parameters
mpdhost = 192.168.0.1
#mpdport = 6600
#mpdpassword =
#ownqueue = 1
}}

upmpdcli relies on MPD's curl input plugin which should be enabled by default. It can be explicitly enabled by adding the following to the MPD configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/mpd.conf|1=
input {
	plugin			"curl"
	enabled			"yes"
}
}}

Restart MPD for the changes to take effect:

{{RootCmd|rc-service mpd restart}}

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

Start upmpdcli:

{{RootCmd|rc-service upmpdcli start}}

Start upmpdcli at boot:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add upmpdcli default}}
