|imapfw, the next mail framework|

OfflineIMAP is a python program included in Gentoo to synchronize emails via IMAP. Since some months, the '''imapfw''' project was started to become the '''next generation tool''' with a ''new approach'' and ''extended features''.

There are various features that can be written for imapfw like:
* enable syncing of mail between a local Maildir and a remote IMAP server
* rewrite the offlineimap program with the framework
* start a new in-house IMAP library


A more [http://offlineimap.org/gsoc/ detailed page] dedicated to the GSoC can be found on the OfflineIMAP website.
