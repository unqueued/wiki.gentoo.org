On Saturday 31 January 2015 and Sunday 1 February 2015, the [http://fosdem.org/2015/ Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting FOSDEM 2015] will take place in Brussels, Belgium.

Naturally a Gentoo crowd will be there; this page is intended to collect public information about our presence and help organizing stuff.

We've requested to get the Distributions devroom Saturday after end of the official program, for informal Gentoo discussions. Afterwards, as always, we'll go to the dinner together (but the dinner still needs to be organized).
