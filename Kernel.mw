The ''Linux kernel'' is the core of the operating system and offers an interface for programs to access the hardware. The kernel contains most of the device drivers.

== Installation ==

To create a kernel you have to install the kernel source code. The recommend kernel sources for a desktop system at Gentoo Linux are {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}. These are maintained by the Gentoo developers and patched, to fix security vulnerabilities or functional problems and to improve compatibility with rare system architectures.

Before installing check the active [[USE flag]]s. The USE flags of '''gentoo-sources''' are:

* ''deblob'' - Remove binary blobs from kernel sources to provide [[Wikipedia:Free software|free software]] compliance.

* ''build'' - (Not recommended) Only for creating stages. Never set this USE flag yourself.

* ''symlink'' - Sets the <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> symlink for these kernel sources.

Now [[emerge|install]] '''gentoo-sources''':
{{RootCmd|emerge gentoo-sources}}

Alternative the [[Portage tree]] has more kernel sources:

* {{Package|sys-kernel/vanilla-sources}} - The unchanged kernel sources by Linus Torvald. Because these kernel sources will not be changed by the Gentoo developers, they are not offering support for such kernels.

* To get a full list with short descriptions, search with emerge:
: {{RootCmd|emerge --search sources}}

== Configuration ==

=== genkernel: automatic configuration and setup ===

'''genkernel''' is a tool to automatically configure and setup a kernel. The needed drivers for your system are detected and loaded at boot time. See the [[genkernel]] article.

=== Manual configuration and setup ===

This the perceived silver bullet and enables you with quiet some effort to create a custom-fit kernel configuration. See:

* [[Kernel/Configuration|kernel configuration]]

* [[Kernel/Upgrade|kernel upgrade]]

== Removing ==

See the [[Kernel/Removal|kernel removal]] article.
