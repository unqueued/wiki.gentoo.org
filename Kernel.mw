<!--T:1-->
The '''Linux kernel''' is the core of the operating system and offers an interface for programs to access the hardware. The kernel contains most of the device drivers.

== Installation == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
To create a kernel, it is necessary to install the kernel source code first. The recommended kernel sources for a desktop system are {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}. These are maintained by the Gentoo developers, and patched to fix security vulnerabilities, functional problems, as well as to improve compatibility with rare system architectures.

<!--T:4-->
Before installing, check the active [[USE flag]]s:

</translate>
{{USEflag|package=sys-kernel/gentoo-sources
|build++no
|deblob
|symlink
}}
<translate>

<!--T:6-->
Now install '''gentoo-sources''':

</translate>
{{Emerge|gentoo-sources}}
<translate>

<!--T:7-->
There are various alternative kernel sources in the Portage tree:

<!--T:8-->
* {{Package|sys-kernel/vanilla-sources}} - The official, non-patched Linux kernel sources. Note that because they are left as is, and do not contain any additional patches, they are not supported by Gentoo developers.

<!--T:9-->
* A full list with short descriptions can be found by searching with emerge:

; [[Kernel/Configuration|Manual configuration]]: Manual configuration enables you, with some effort, to create a custom-fit kernel configuration.

<!--T:24-->
; [[genkernel|Automatic configuration]]: '''genkernel''' is a tool to automatically configure and setup a kernel. The needed drivers for your system are detected and loaded at boot time. 

<!--T:25-->
; [[Kernel/Upgrade|Upgrade]]: Steps to upgrade to a new kernel using an existing configuration.
