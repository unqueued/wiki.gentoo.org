'''Firefox''' is Mozilla's solution to the web browser.

'''Aurora''' is the "unbranded" version of Mozilla's Firefox.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=www-client/firefox}}

The above list of USE flag is not comprehensive. Use <tt>equery</tt> (part of {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}) for a full list:

{{Cmd|equery uses www-client/firefox}}

=== Emerge ===

To compile the source version of Firefox, issue:

{{Emerge|www-client/firefox}}

Emerging the source version of Firefox can be a long process; a pre-compiled (binary) version does exist in the Portage tree, however users of the pre-built package should note the warning below. To emerge the Firefox binary, issue:

{{Emerge|www-client/firefox-bin}}

== Configuration ==

=== Disabling percent-encoding ===

Normally, URLs that are copied from the address bar get percent-encoded. This may cause an annoyance when certain non-Latin symbols (such as Cyrillic) get encoded, as they become unreadable to humans.

To disable percent-encoding when copying from the address bar, set the <code>about:config</code> option <code>network.standard-url.escape-utf8</code> to <code>false</code>.

{{Note|Unfortunately Firefox does not support non-Latin symbols in anchors, those remain encoded (not percent-encoded, though).}}

=== Special URLs ===

Firefox includes a few dozen special URLs that can be helpful in determining more information about various Firefox settings. These URLs can be entered into the Super Bar (via copy and paste) to view the special pages. A few of the more significant ones include:

* <code>about:addons</code>
* <code>about:config</code>
* <code>about:crashes</code>
* <code>about:memory</code>
* <code>about:networking</code>
* <code>about:plugins</code>
* <code>about:support</code>
* <code>about:telemetry</code>

A full list of special pages can be viewed on the [http://kb.mozillazine.org/About_protocol_links Mozilla Zine wiki].

=== HTML 5 video support ===

{{Important|The disadvantage of using pre-compiled {{Package|www-client/firefox-bin}} package is that most USE flags in the list above ''cannot'' be set. Be aware that setting flags while using this package will not alter the binary. To include support for gstreamer or full support for HTML 5 emerge the source package.}}

'''Problem:''' Audio plays, but no video is visible.

'''Solution:''' Check, if flash block is enabled. Some websites like YouTube for example still require flash to play HTML 5 videos properly. (This is the situation on 2016-07-29 and may change in future.)

=== XDG integration ===

In order to make Firefox use XDG file associations set Content Type's Action to {{Path|/usr/bin/xdg-open}}

<gallery>File:Firefox'_file_associations.png|Firefox file associations</gallery>

To ensure Firefox is being used by other applications for handling HTTP and HTTPS links, run the following commands:

{{Cmd|xdg-mime default firefox.desktop x-scheme-handler/http
|xdg-mime default firefox.desktop x-scheme-handler/https
|xdg-mime default firefox.desktop text/html}}

=== Running in sandbox ===

The [[Simple sandbox]] article explains why »Sandboxing Firefox is mandatory«.

=== Safer browsing with Add-ons ===

Firefox has a massive community behind it and a result many Add-ons have been created to aid with specific interests of users. Many users are concerned about their privacy (tracking, bubbling, targeting, etc) while web browsing. Installing Add-ons can aid in adding an extra level of privacy to their browsing.

The Add-on menu can be accessed by navigating the following menus: {{Path|Hamburger button (top right under the X) → Add-ons}}

==== Adblock ====

To block annoying ads use Adblock. Adblock does include an "acceptable ads" list (advertisers pay for that), so some advertisements are still displayed.<ref>https://adblockplus.org/en/features#acceptable</ref> For an Add-on that blocks all ads, see uBlock Origin.

Mozilla Add-ons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/

Homepage: https://adblockplus.org/en/

==== uBlock Origin ====

A new ad blocker with lower resource usage, using same lists as Adblock. Very versatile and configurable.

Mozilla Add-ons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/

GitHub: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock

==== NoScript ====

NoScript blocks JavaScript that is normally enabled by default. It can keep users safe and speed up web browsing.

Mozilla Add-ons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/

Homepage: https://noscript.net/

==== RefControl ====

RefControl is an extension that lets you control what gets sent as the HTTP Referer on a per-site basis.

Mozilla Add-ons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refcontrol/

Homepage: http://www.stardrifter.org/refcontrol/

Known problems:

* LiveJournal: commenting post via OpenID leads to CAPTHA form, that didn’t work with “wrong” HTTP Referer (or maybe a problem in the commenting form itself).

==== uMatrix ====

Point and click to forbid/allow any class of requests made by your browser. Use it to block scripts, iframes, ads, Facebook, etc.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Crashes ===

If Firefox crashes for no apparent reason every few minutes with an error message like <code>ABORT: X_GLXDestroyContext: GLXBadContext; 15 requests ago</code> it might help to add the Firefox user(s) to the video group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> video}}
