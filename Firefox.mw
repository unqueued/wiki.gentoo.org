'''Firefox''' is [[Article description::Mozilla's solution to the web browser.]] It is not the same thing as [[Firefox OS]], which was a full operating system.

'''Aurora''' is the "unbranded" version of Mozilla's Firefox.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=www-client/firefox}}

The above list of USE flag is not comprehensive. Use {{c|equery}} (part of {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}) for a full list:

{{Cmd|equery uses www-client/firefox}}

=== Emerge ===

To compile the source version of Firefox, issue:

{{Emerge|www-client/firefox}}

Emerging the source version of Firefox can be a long process; a pre-compiled (binary) version does exist in the Gentoo repository, however users of the pre-built package should note the warning below. To emerge the Firefox binary, issue:

{{Emerge|www-client/firefox-bin}}

{{Important|The disadvantage of using pre-compiled {{Package|www-client/firefox-bin}} package is that almost all of the USE flags in the list above ''cannot'' be set. Be aware that setting these flags while using this package will not alter the binary.}}

== Configuration ==

=== Enabling multitouch ===

==== Xinput2 scrolling ====

This brings touch scrolling and multitouch support for Firefox:

<var>MOZ_USE_XINPUT2</var> [[Handbook:X86/Working/EnvVar|environment variable]] has to be set to a value of <code>1</code> in {{Path|/etc/env.d/80firefox}}, or just before launching {{c|firefox}} in a shell. for example:

{{Cmd|MOZ_USE_XINPUT2{{=}}"1" firefox}}

This also ''eliminates'' the predefined ''scroll step size'' for touchpad scrolling! All scrolling will be ''really'' smooth.

Wacom tablets/touchscreens may need [[Wacom#Xinput2_multitouch|extra configuration]] so they emit true touch events for [[X]].

==== Multitouch zoom ====

This only works when the multitouch events reach Firefox, therefore the <code>Xinput2</code> activation above has to be done first.

{| class="table table-striped table-condensed"
! Description
! about:config option
! Value
|-
| Multitouch activation
| <code>gestures.enable_single_finger_input</code>
| <code>False</code>
|-
| Zoom in
| <code>browser.gesture.pinch.in</code>
| <code>cmd_fullZoomReduce</code>
|-
| Zoom out
| <code>browser.gesture.pinch.out</code>
| <code>cmd_fullZoomEnlarge</code>
|}

=== Middle mouse scroll (autoscroll) ===

Traditionally in Linux, the middle mouse button is used to paste the currently selected (highlighted) text into a text field. On Windows systems, the middle mouse button in Firefox is used for click-and-drag scrolling up and down the page. This functionality can be enabled in Firefox by opening <code>about:config</code> and setting the following value<ref>https://askubuntu.com/a/95333</ref>:

* <code>general.autoScroll = true</code>

Middle click-and-drag scrolling should now be enabled.

Although not necessary, sometimes it is desirable to disable all other middle-click functionality within Firefox when using click-and-drap scrolling. Open <code>about:config</code> and set the following values to disable middle-click functionality:

* <code>middlemouse.contentLoadURL = false</code>
* <code>middlemouse.openNewWindow = false</code>
* <code>middlemouse.paste = false</code>

=== Threads ===

Firefox >= 54 has 4 threads enabled by default. Theads can be adjusted by modifying the following in the <code>about:config</code> interface:

{| class="table table-striped table-condensed"
! Description
! about:config option
! Value
|-
| Increase the threads
| <code>dom.ipc.processCount</code>
| <code>N</code>
|}

Where <code>N</code> is a integer number.

=== Disabling percent-encoding ===

Normally, URLs that are copied from the address bar get percent-encoded. This may cause an annoyance when certain non-Latin symbols (such as Cyrillic) get encoded, as they become unreadable to humans.

To disable percent-encoding when copying from the address bar, set the <code>about:config</code> option <code>network.standard-url.escape-utf8</code> to <code>false</code>.

{{Note|Unfortunately Firefox does not support non-Latin symbols in anchors, those remain encoded (not percent-encoded, though).}}

=== Disable enforced digital signatures verification in Firefox >=48 ===

This concerns mandatory [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Extension_Signing add-ons signature] in Firefox and can lead to security issues.

==== Method 1 ====

Create this file:
{{FileBox|filename=/usr/lib/firefox/config.js|lang=javascript|1=
//
try {
  Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm", {})
    .eval("SIGNED_TYPES.clear()");
}
catch(ex) {}
END
}}
Then insert this:
{{FileBox|filename=/usr/lib/firefox/defaults/pref/channel-prefs.js|lang=javascript|1=
pref("general.config.obscure_value", 0);
pref("general.config.filename", "config.js");
}}

The set <code>xpinstall.signatures.required</code> to false.

=== Special URLs ===

Firefox includes a few dozen special URLs that can be helpful in determining more information about various Firefox settings. These URLs can be entered into the Super Bar (via copy and paste) to view the special pages. A few of the more significant ones include:

* <code>about:addons</code>
* <code>about:config</code>
* <code>about:crashes</code>
* <code>about:memory</code>
* <code>about:networking</code>
* <code>about:plugins</code>
* <code>about:support</code>
* <code>about:telemetry</code>

Finally, <code>about:about</code> will display the whole list of Firefox' “about” pages.

See also [https://superuser.com/questions/392471/firefox-chrome-document-urls Firefox chrome:// document URLs].

=== XDG integration ===

In order to make Firefox use XDG file associations set Content Type's Action to {{Path|/usr/bin/xdg-open}}

<gallery>File:Firefox'_file_associations.png|Firefox file associations</gallery>

To ensure Firefox is being used by other applications for handling HTTP and HTTPS links, run the following commands:

{{Cmd|xdg-mime default firefox.desktop x-scheme-handler/http
|xdg-mime default firefox.desktop x-scheme-handler/https
|xdg-mime default firefox.desktop text/html}}

== Security ==

=== Running in sandbox ===

The [[Simple sandbox]] article explains why »Sandboxing Firefox is mandatory«.

=== SSL/TLS Security Enhancements ===

Some <code>about:config</code> SSL/TLS security options which are not defaults (Firefox 52.2.0). Two of them rarely break access to websites.

{| class="table table-striped table-condensed"

=== Safer browsing with Add-ons ===

Firefox has a massive community behind it and a result many Add-ons have been created to aid with specific interests of users. Many users are concerned about their privacy (tracking, bubbling, targeting, etc) while web browsing. Installing Add-ons can aid in adding an extra level of privacy to their browsing.

The Add-on menu can be accessed by navigating the following menus: {{Path|Hamburger button (top right under the X) → Add-ons}}

==== uBlock Origin ====

A new ad blocker with lower resource usage, using same lists as Adblock. Very versatile and configurable.

Mozilla Add-ons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/

GitHub: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock

==== NoScript ====

NoScript blocks JavaScript that is normally enabled by default. It can keep users safe and speed up web browsing.

Mozilla Add-ons page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/

Homepage: https://noscript.net/

==== uMatrix ====

Point and click to forbid/allow any class of requests made by your browser. Use it to block scripts, iframes, ads, Facebook, etc.  uMatrix can also be used for spoofing HTTP referrer, spoofing User Agent strings, blocking hyperlink auditing and forcing strict HTTPS.  Note, uMatrix can break many websites and most websites need configuration changes to work correctly.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== gtk+:3 pulls in DBUS ===

Since version ≥53.0 Firefox has dropped [[GTK+|gtk+]]:2 support urging [[Larry the cow|Larry]] to use gtk+:3. This however by default pulls-in annoyances like [[D-Bus|DBUS]]. This can be avoided by using a [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1060964-start-38-highlight-BSD%20maintain%20a%20patch.html patch from BSD] available in [https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/mv/tree/master/x11-libs/gtk%2B mv overlay].

=== Crashes ===

If Firefox crashes for no apparent reason every few minutes with an error message like <code>ABORT: X_GLXDestroyContext: GLXBadContext; 15 requests ago</code> it might help to add the Firefox user(s) to the video group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> video}}

=== Latest adobe-flash-23 does not work ===

It is possible to use PPAPI NPAPI plugin adapter. For more info read [https://github.com/i-rinat/freshplayerplugin/blob/master/README.md here]

{{RootCmd|emerge freshplayerplugin}}

=== Lack of sound ===

If Firefox built with the <code>gstreamer</code> USE flag does not play sounds, and some web sites tell you to install Flash to play music, make sure that the necessary codecs are installed:

{{RootCmd|emerge gst-plugins-meta:1.0}}
