'''Firefox''' is Mozilla's solution to the web browser.

'''Aurora''' is the "unbranded" version of Mozilla's Firefox.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=www-client/firefox|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|www-client/firefox}}:
|bindist
|dbus
|debug
|gmp-autoupdate+++Allow Gecko Media Plugins (binary blobs) to be automatically downloaded and kept up-to-date in user profiles
|gstreamer
|hardened
|jit
|ldap
|lightning+++Enable calendar support
|minimal
|pulseaudio
|startup-notification
|system-cairo+++Use the system-wide x11-libs/cairo instead of bundled.
|system-icu+++Use the system-wide dev-libs/icu instead of bundled.
|system-jpeg+++Use the system-wide media-libs/libjpeg-turbo instead of bundled.
|system-libvpx+++Use the system-wide media-libs/libvpx instead of bundled.

}}

The above list of USE flag is not comprehensive. Use <tt>equery</tt> (part of {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}) for a full list:

{{Cmd|equery uses www-client/firefox}}

=== Emerge ===

To compile the source version of Firefox, issue:

{{Emerge|www-client/firefox}}

Emerging the source version of Firefox can be a long process; a pre-compiled (binary) version does exist in the Portage tree, however users of the pre-built package should note the warning below. To emerge the Firefox binary, issue:

{{Emerge|www-client/firefox-bin}}

{{Important|The disadvantage of using pre-compiled {{Package|www-client/firefox-bin}} package is that most USE flags in the list above ''cannot'' be set. Be aware that setting flags while using this package will not alter the binary. To include support for gstreamer or full support for HTML5 use the <u>source</u> package.}}

== Configuration ==

=== Tips and tricks ===

==== Disable percent-encoding ====

Problem: URL copied from address bar is percent-encoded, so if URL contains non-Latin symbols (for example, Cyrillic) it is unreadable for humans.

Solution: To disable percent-encoding when URL coping from address bar, set <code>network.standard-url.escape-utf8</code> {{Path|about:config}} option to <code>false</code>.

Possible pitfalls: Non-Latin letter symbols is not supported by standard for HTTP(S) URLs, but virtually fine for all modern browsers. Space symbol (%20) stay percent-encoding, so copied URL don’t “breaks”.

{{Note|Unfortunately Firefox does not support non-Latin letter symbols in anchors, so it remain encoded (not percent-encoded, though).}}

==== Special URLs ====

Firefox includes a few dozen special URLs that can be helpful in determining more information about various Firefox settings. These URLs can be entered into the Super Bar to view the special pages. A few of the more significant ones include:

* <code>[http://about:addons about:addons]</code>
* <code>[http://about:config about:config]</code>
* <code>[http://about:crashes about:crashes]</code>
* <code>[http://about:memory about:memory]</code>
* <code>[http://about:networking about:networking]</code>
* <code>[http://about:plugins about:plugins]</code>
* <code>[http://about:support about:support]</code>
* <code>[http://about:telemetry about:telemetry]</code>

A full list of options can be viewed on the [http://kb.mozillazine.org/About_protocol_links Mozilla Zine wiki].


==== XDG integration ====

In order to make Firefox use XDG file associations set Content Type's Action to {{Path|/usr/bin/xdg-open}}

<gallery>File:Firefox'_file_associations.png|Firefox file associations</gallery>

To ensure Firefox is being used by other applications for handling HTTP and HTTPS links, run the following commands:

{{Cmd|xdg-mime default firefox.desktop x-scheme-handler/http
|xdg-mime default firefox.desktop x-scheme-handler/https
|xdg-mime default firefox.desktop text/html}}

=== Safer browsing with Add-ons ===

Firefox has a massive community behind it and a result many Add-ons have been created to aid with specific interests of users. Many users are concerned about their privacy (tracking, bubbling, targeting, etc) while web browsing. Installing Add-ons can aid in adding an extra level of privacy to their browsing.

The Add-on menu can be accessed by navigating the following menus:
{{Path|Hamburger button (top right under the X) → Add-ons}}

==== Adblock ====

To block annoying ads use Adblock. Adblock does include an "acceptable ads" list, so some advertisements are still displayed.<ref>https://adblockplus.org/en/features#acceptable</ref> For an Add-on that blocks all ads, see Adblock Edge.

==== Adblock Edge ====

Adblock Edge is a fork of Adblock. Its purpose is to follow the "keep it simple sir" philosophy by blocking all ads.<ref>http://adstomper.bitbucket.org/index.html</ref>

==== NoScript ====

NoScript blocks JavaScript that is normally enabled by default. It can keep users safe and speed up web browsing.
