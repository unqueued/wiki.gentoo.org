== Purpose ==

The main purpose of this wiki page is to guide fellow UNIX Network
Admins/SRE/DevOps into configuring a fully-fledged swiss-army knife Gentoo for
making the Network debugging much more easier.

{{Note|This guide assumes you're already familiar with the Networking terminology and won't go into further details explaining for example what DNS is, what's an IP Address, what are the OSI Layers et. al.}}

== Useful tools ==

=== DNS debugging ===

{{c|net-dns/bind-tools}} contains most of the DNS debugging tools you'll need,
such as {{c|nslookup}}, {{c|dig}} and {{c|host}}.

{{Emerge|net-dns/bind-tools}}

=== SSL/TLS/PKI troubleshooting ===

{{c|s_client}}, {{c|ocsp}}, {{c|x509}} and others
{{Emerge|dev-libs/openssl}}

=== Port knocking/scanning ===

Most popular command for {{c|netcat}} is <code>nc -zv <host> <port></code>

{{Emerge|net-analyzer/netcat}}

Check which ports are open, which services are running with {{c|nmap}}.

{{Emerge|net-analyzer/nmap}}

=== Traffic analysers ===

Listen on an interface and show src/dest traffic + speed
{{Emerge|net-analyzer/iftop}}

Inspect incoming/outgoing packets
{{Emerge|net-analyzer/tcpdump}}

=== IP troubleshooting (L3) ===

{{c|MyTraceroute}} does a traceroute by probing with ICMP packets
{{Emerge|net-analyzer/mtr}}

In case ICMP is blocked by some firewall in your LAN, you can try {{c|tcptraceroute}}
{{Emerge|net-analyzer/tcptraceroute}}

=== L1 troubleshooting ===

Link detection, WOL support, Link modes et. al.
{{Emerge|sys-apps/ethtool}}

==== Others ====

Copy logs, file contents et. al. without leaving terminal <code>cat
/var/log/emerge.log | xclip -sel clip</code>
{{Emerge|x11-misc/xclip}}
