The '''X.Org server''', part of the X.Org releases, is the main component of the X Window system, which abstracts the hardware and provides the foundation for most graphical user interfaces, like [[:Category:Desktop environment|Desktop environments]] or [[:Category:Window manager|Window manager]], and its applications.

== Installation ==
{{Note|If you're only updating, check the [[/upgrade|upgrade subpage]].}}

Before installing xorg-server check and setup it's depends.

=== global USE flag ===
Portage knows the global USE flag ''X'' for enabling support for X in other packages (default in all ''desktop'' [[profile]]s):
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
USE="... X ..."
</pre>}}

=== xorg-drivers ===
{{Package|x11-base/xorg-drivers}} is a meta package to pull in the wanted drivers:
* [[:Category:Graphics Adapters|Graphics adapters]]
* [[:Category:Input devices|Input devices]]
Follow the links for information how to set up these devices.

=== mesa ===
{{Package|media-libs/mesa}} (see [[Wikipedia:Mesa 3D (OpenGL)|Wikipedia]]) is a graphic library that provides a generic OpenGL implementation.

Now install {{Package|x11-base/xorg-server}}.<br />
Alternatively you can install the {{Package|x11-base/xorg-x11}} meta package, which installs the full X.Org release with additional fonts and utilities. They're not necessary for a working desktop.

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== xorg.conf ===
The X server is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit Xorg's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

=== Boot service ===
Usually the X server is started by starting a [[display manager]] automatically on boot.

== x11 overlay ==
The Gentoo X11 team maintains the ''[http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/x11.git;a=summary x11]'' [[overlay]]. It contains X.Org versions in preparation to be moved to the portage tree, pre versions of the next main version and live versions for trunk. Use [[layman]] to setup the overlay.
