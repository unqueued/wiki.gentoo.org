The '''X.Org server''', part of the X.Org releases, is the main component of the X Window system, which abstracts the hardware and provides the foundation for most graphical user interfaces, like [[:Category:Desktop environment|Desktop environments]] or [[:Category:Window manager|Window managers]], and their applications.

== Installation ==

This page will provide you with useful information but the [[Xorg/Guide|Xorg guide]] details the installation of Xorg in a more convenient manner.

{{Note|If you're only updating, check the [[/upgrade|upgrade sub-article]].}}

=== USE flags ===

Portage knows the <code>X</code> USE flag for enabling support for X in other packages (default in all ''desktop'' [[Profile (Portage)|profile]]s). Make sure this USE flag is added to the USE flag list to ensure X compatibility system wide: 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|1=
USE="X"
}}

=== xorg-drivers ===

{{Package|x11-base/xorg-drivers}} is a meta package to pull in the wanted drivers:

* [[:Category:Graphics Adapters|Graphics adapters]], see [[:/etc/portage/make.conf#VIDEO_CARDS|VIDEO_CARDS]]
* [[:Category:Input devices|Input devices]] and [[:/etc/portage/make.conf#INPUT_DEVICES|INPUT_DEVICES]]

Follow the links for information how to set up these devices.

=== mesa ===

{{Package|media-libs/mesa}} (see [[Wikipedia:Mesa 3D (OpenGL)|Wikipedia]]) is a graphic library that provides a generic OpenGL implementation.

{{USEflag|package=media-libs/mesa}}

=== xorg-server ===

Now install {{Package|x11-base/xorg-server}}.

Alternatively you can install the {{Package|x11-base/xorg-x11}} meta package, which installs the full X.Org release with additional fonts and utilities. They're not necessary for a working desktop.

{{USEflag|package=x11-base/xorg-server}}

{{Emerge|xorg-server}}

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===

{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== xorg.conf ===

The X server is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit Xorg's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

=== Boot service ===

Usually the X server is started by starting a [[display manager]] automatically on boot.

== x11 overlay ==

The Gentoo X11 team maintains the ''[https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/x11.git x11]'' [[overlay]]. It contains X.Org versions in preparation to be moved to the portage tree, pre versions of the next main version and live versions for trunk. Use [[layman]] to setup the overlay.
