'''LXQt''' is a lightweight desktop environment based on the Qt toolkit. It is the result of the merge between the LXDE-Qt and the Razor-qt projects.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Get the complete LXQt desktop environment by installing the {{Package|lxqt-base/lxqt-meta}} package:

{{Emerge|lxqt-base/lxqt-meta}}

=== Keywords ===

Since LXQt has not yet been marked stable on Gentoo, it may be necessary to add the necessary packages create a keyword file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.keywords/lxqt|1=
dev-qt/*
lxqt-base/*
media-gfx/lximage-qt
x11-misc/obconf-qt
x11-misc/pcmanfm-qt
x11-misc/sddm
}}

== Applications ==

Any Qt application can be used with LXQt, but if Qt applications that do not depend on any component of KDE are preferred please see the [[Qt Desktop applications]] article.

== Support ==

Support for LXQt on Gentoo can be found in the {{IRC|gentoo-qt}} Freenode IRC channel. Bugs should be reported at the [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ Gentoo's Bugzilla].
