'''LXQt''' is a lightweight desktop environment based on the Qt toolkit. It is the result of the merge between the LXDE-Qt and the Razor-qt projects.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Get the complete LXQt desktop environment by installing the {{Package|lxqt-base/lxqt-meta}} package:

{{Emerge|lxqt-base/lxqt-meta}}

=== Keywords ===

Since LXQt has not yet been marked stable on Gentoo, it is necessary to add a few packages to {{Path|package.accept_keywords}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/lxqt|1=
lxqt-base/*
media-gfx/lximage-qt
x11-misc/obconf-qt
x11-misc/pcmanfm-qt
}}

You may need to keyword other packages; {{c|emerge}} will tell you if it is the case.

== Configuration ==

=== Launching LXQt with startx ===

The {{c|startlxqt}} command launches LXQt.

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec ck-launch-session startlxqt
}}

{{c|ck-launch-session}} is needed to be able to shutdown or reboot the system from the LXQt menu.

You may also need to start [[D-Bus]] manually, for example if notifications are not working or if there are several {{c|dbus-launch}} processes in the output from {{c|pstree}}:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch --exit-with-session startlxqt
}}

Alternatively, the {{c|dbus}} service can be [[D-Bus#Services|started at boot time]].

{{Note|Script execution will stop after the first line starting with {{c|exec}}, so put any other command you want to run '''above''' it.}}

=== Changing the GTK+ themes ===

The LXQt appearance settings GUI has no support for changing GTK+ themes, so you may want to install {{Package|lxde-base/lxappearance}} to take care of that.

Alternatively, you can change the themes manually, for example using the GTK2_RC_FILES variable:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
export GTK2_RC_FILES=/home/user/.themes/Drakfire\ Black/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
exec startlxqt
}}
The [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GTK%2B GTK+ page of the Arch Linux wiki] has more information for configuring GTK+2 and GTK+3 themes.

If you want Qt 4 applications to use your GTK+2 theme, make sure that {{Package|dev-qt/qtgui}} is installed with the <var>gtkstyle</var> USE flag, and select the {{c|GTK+}} widget style in the LXQt appearance settings. For Qt 5 applications you will need (since the update to Qt 5.7) to install {{c|x11-themes/qtstyleplugins}} from the {{c|abendbrot}} overlay to get the GTK+ style.

=== Automounting volumes ===

By default, LXQt tries to automount every attached disk at startup and when they are plugged in. It may result in unwanted popup windows asking for the root password to mount disks.

The automount options are located in the PCManFM file manager settings:
* In the applications menu, open {{c|Accessories->PCManFM File Manager}}.
* Select the {{c|Edit->Preferences}} menu item.
* Click on {{c|Volume}}.
* Disable or enable the desired features.

=== Adding custom actions to PCManFM-Qt ===

PCManFM-Qt supports the [http://www.nautilus-actions.org/?q=node/377 desktop file specification extension] so it is possible to add custom actions to the contextual menu for files and directories.

{{Package|x11-libs/libfm}} and {{Package|x11-libs/libfm-extra}} v1.2.4 or above are required, and the <var>vala</var> USE flag must be enabled:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/lxqt|1=
x11-libs/libfm vala
}}

Rebuilding the package can be done with:
{{RootCmd|emerge -1a libfm}}

Once this is done, special .desktop files can be created in {{Path|~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/}}. For example here is a simple action that will pop up a notification with the path to the selected file or folder:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/test.desktop|1=
[Desktop Entry]
Name = Test action
Profiles = on_icon;

[X-Action-Profile on_icon]
Exec = notify-send "You selected %f"
}}

PCManFM-Qt needs to be restarted to become aware of any change made to the custom actions. The safest and simplest way is to logout and login again (restart LXQt).

Alternatively it is possible to exit all instances of PCManFM-Qt with {{c|pcmanfm-qt -q}} before launching it again, but be aware that it will likely switch to a different set of settings (it can use two different config directories, one "default" and one "lxqt", as you can see in {{Path|~/.config/pcmanfm-qt/}}) and for example automount volumes which may cause issues if you are not careful.

== Applications ==

Any Qt application can be used with LXQt, but if Qt applications that do not depend on any component of KDE are preferred please see the [[Qt Desktop applications]] article.

== Support ==

Support for LXQt on Gentoo can be found in the {{IRC|gentoo-qt}} Freenode IRC channel. Bugs should be reported at the [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ Gentoo's Bugzilla].

The official IRC channel for LXQt is {{IRC|lxde}} on Freenode.
