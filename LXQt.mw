'''LXQt''' is a lightweight desktop environment based on the Qt toolkit. It is the result of the merge between the LXDE-Qt and the Razor-qt projects.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Get the complete LXQt desktop environment by installing the {{Package|lxqt-base/lxqt-meta}} package:

{{Emerge|lxqt-base/lxqt-meta}}

=== Keywords ===

Since LXQt has not yet been marked stable on Gentoo, it may be necessary to add the necessary packages create a keyword file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.keywords/lxqt|1=
dev-qt/*
lxqt-base/*
media-gfx/lximage-qt
x11-misc/obconf-qt
x11-misc/pcmanfm-qt
x11-misc/sddm
}}

== Configuration ==

=== Launching LXQt with startx ===

The {{c|startlxqt}} command launches LXQt.

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec startlxqt
}}

{{Note|Script execution will stop after the first line starting with {{c|exec}}, so put any other command you want to run above it.}}

=== Changing the GTK+ themes ===

The LXQt appearance settings GUI has no support for changing GTK+ themes, so you may want to install {{Package|lxde-base/lxappearance}} to take care of that.

Alternatively, you can change the themes manually, for example using the GTK2_RC_FILES variable:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
export GTK2_RC_FILES=/home/user/.themes/Drakfire\ Black/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
exec startlxqt
}}
The [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GTK%2B GTK+ page of the Arch Linux wiki] has more information for configuring GTK+2 and GTK+3 themes.

If you want Qt applications to use your GTK+2 theme, make sure that {{Package|dev-qt/qtgui}} is installed with the <var>gtkstyle</var> USE flag, and select the {{c|GTK+}} widget style in the LXQt appearance settings.

== Applications ==

Any Qt application can be used with LXQt, but if Qt applications that do not depend on any component of KDE are preferred please see the [[Qt Desktop applications]] article.

== Support ==

Support for LXQt on Gentoo can be found in the {{IRC|gentoo-qt}} Freenode IRC channel. Bugs should be reported at the [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ Gentoo's Bugzilla].
