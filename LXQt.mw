'''LXQt''' is a lightweight desktop environment based on the Qt toolkit. It is the result of the merge between the LXDE-Qt and the Razor-qt projects.

== Installation ==

You can get the complete LXQt desktop environment by installing the {{Package|lxqt-base/lxqt-meta}} package:

{{Emerge|lxqt-meta}}

Since LXQt has not yet been marked stable on Gentoo, you may need to add the necessary packages to your keywords file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.keywords/lxqt|1=
dev-qt/*
lxqt-base/*
media-gfx/lximage-qt
x11-misc/obconf-qt
x11-misc/pcmanfm-qt
x11-misc/sddm
}}

Also, the qt5 useflag is masked on stable, so you may need to do:

{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/portage/profile && echo -qt5 >> /etc/portage/profile/use.stable.mask}}

== Applications ==

Any application can be used with LXQt, but if you prefer Qt applications that don't depend on any component of KDE please see the [[Qt Desktop applications]] article.

== Support ==

Support for LXQt on Gentoo can be found in the #gentoo-qt Freenode IRC channel. Bugs should be reported at the [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ Gentoo Bugzilla].
