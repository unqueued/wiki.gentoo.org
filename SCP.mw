'''SCP''' ('''S'''ecure '''C'''opy '''P'''rogram) is an interactive file transfer program, similar to the {{c|copy}} command, it copies files over an encrypted SSH transport. It uses many features of [[SSH]], such as public key authentication and compression.<ref>http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/scp.1?query=scp&sec=1</ref>

== Installation ==

On the majority of Gentoo mediums {{c|scp}} should be installed as part of the default system profile. To verify installation run the {{c|scp}} command. A usage statement should appear:

{{Cmd|scp|output=<pre>
usage: scp [-12346BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
           [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
           [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2
</pre>}}

If no usage statement is displayed then {{c|scp}} is not installed or has been corrupted. Follow the installation instructions beginning at [[SSH#Emerge|Emerge section]] in the [[SSH]] article to install SCP.

== Configuration ==

For configuration see [[SSH#Configuration|the configuration section in the SSH article]].
