scp ('''s'''ecure '''c'''opy '''p'''rogram) is an interactive file transfer program, similar to the <tt>copy</tt> command, it copies files over an encrypted SSH transport. It uses many features of SSH, such as public key authentication and compression.<ref>http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/scp.1?query=scp&sec=1</ref>

== Installation ==
On the majority of Gentoo mediums <tt>scp</tt> should be installed as part of the default system profile. To verify installation run the <tt>scp</tt> command. A usage statement should appear:
{{Cmd|scp|output=<pre>
usage: scp [-12346BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
           [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
           [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2
</pre>}}

If no usage statement is displayed then <tt>scp</tt> is not installed or has been corrupted. Follow the installation instructions beginning at [[SSH#USE_flags|the USE flag section in the SSH article to install SCP]].

== Configuration ==
For configuration see [[SSH#Configuration|the configuration section in the SSH article]].
