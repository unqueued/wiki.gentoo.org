{{c|eix}} is [[Article description::a set of utilities for searching and diffing local ebuild repositories using a binary cache.]]

It is made to be more efficient and flexible than the {{c|emerge --search}} command. {{c|eix}} comes with colorized output which helps users easily find the needed package information.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-portage/eix}}:

{{Emerge|app-portage/eix}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

* {{Path|/etc/eix-sync.conf}} - Stores commands and configurations for {{c|eix-sync}}
* {{Path|/etc/eixrc}} - {{c|eix}}'s global configuration file.
* {{Path|~/.eixrc}} - {{c|eix}}'s per-user configuration file.

=== Environment variables ===

* <var>EIXRC</var> - If this variable can set a new location for {{c|eix}}'s global configuration file (see above).
* <var>EIX_SYNC_OPTS</var>, <var>EIX_SYNC_CONF</var>, <var>EIX_REMOTE_OPTS</var>, <var>EIX_LAYMAN_OPTS</var>, <var>EIX_TEST_OBSOLETE_OPTS</var> - Security relevant variables. See the man page for more details.

=== Managing the cache ===

==== Updating the cache manually ====

After the installation has finished, it is important to update the cache to index all packages on the system. Running following command will update the local {{c|eix}} cache:

{{RootCmd|eix-update}}

==== Updating the cache with each sync ====

After each update of the Portage tree the cache needs to be updated. Additionally, one may want to see a diff of the changes since the last sync: 

{{RootCmd
|cp -a /var/cache/eix/portage.eix /var/cache/eix/previous.eix
|eix-update
|eix-diff
}}

The following 2 methods are used to automatically update the cache with each sync. 
{{Note|Method 1 is preferred, as it is able to work in combination with all possible {{c|emaint sync}} commands (see [[Project:Portage/Sync|Portage plug-in sync system specification]]).}}

===== Method 1: Using Portage's postsync hook =====

After each sync all executable scripts in the directory {{Path|/etc/portage/postsync.d/}} are called: 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/postsync.d/eix|1=
#!/bin/sh
if [[ -e /var/cache/eix/portage.eix ]]; then 
    cp -a /var/cache/eix/portage.eix /var/cache/eix/previous.eix; 
fi
eix-update
if [[ -e /var/cache/eix/previous.eix ]]; then 
    eix-diff; 
fi
}}

If additional ebuild repositories are used, {{c|eix-update}} can become quite slow, as many of them do not provide pregenerated caches. To speed up the process of {{c|eix-update}}, one can hook portage to regenerate the cache for each repository after each sync. An example for this is given in the file {{Path|/etc/portage/repo.postsync.d/example}}. We can copy this example to {{Path|/etc/portage/repo.postsync.d/egencache}} and make it executable. 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/repo.postsync.d/egencache|1=
#!/bin/sh

# The repository name.
repository_name=${1}
# The URI to which the repository was synced.
sync_uri=${2}
# The path to the repository.
repository_path=${3}

# Portage assumes that a hook succeeded if it exits with 0 code. If no
# explicit exit is done, the exit code is the exit code of last spawned
# command. Since our script is a bit more complex, we want to control
# the exit code explicitly.
ret=0

if [ -n "${repository_name}" ]; then
        # Repository name was provided, so we're in a post-repository hook.
        echo "* In post-repository hook for ${repository_name}"
        echo "** synced from remote repository ${sync_uri}"
        echo "** synced into ${repository_path}"

        # Gentoo comes with pregenerated cache but the other repositories
        # usually don't. Generate them to improve performance.
        if [ "${repository_name}" != "gentoo" ]; then
                if ! egencache --update --repo="${repository_name}" --jobs=8
                then
                        echo "!!! egencache failed!"
                        ret=1
                fi
        fi
fi


# Return explicit status.
exit "${ret}"
}}

===== Method 2: Using eix-sync =====

Alternatively, one can use {{c|eix-sync}} tool from {{c|eix}} itself:

{{RootCmd|eix-sync}}

The above command is a shorthand way to running these commands sequentially:

{{RootCmd
|emerge --sync
|cp -a /var/cache/eix/portage.eix /var/cache/eix/previous.eix
|eix-update
|eix-diff
}}

If [[ebuild repository|ebuild repositories]] are used, it is recommended to configure {{c|eix}} to synchronize them too:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/eix-sync.conf|1=
*
}}

To speed up {{c|eix-update}} in case of large repositories have a look at [[Ebuild repository/eix-sync|this page]].

=== Adding remote repositories to the cache ===

To search all available repositories (and not only the checked out repositories), add them to the cache with the command:

{{RootCmd|eix-remote update}}

To have the above command be run automatically on each eix-sync, a solution is to use a postsync hook:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/postsync.d/eix|1=
#!/bin/sh
eix-remote update
}}
Do not forget to make the file executable:
{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/portage/postsync.d/eix}}

=== Using tmpfs cache ===

This breaks {{c|eix}} because {{Path|/var/cache/eix}} is missing when {{Path|/var/cache}} is mounted:

{{RootCmd|grep /var/cache /etc/fstab|output=<pre>
none /var/cache tmpfs size=512m 0 0
</pre>}}

The simple solution is to move the {{c|eix}} cache file away from the default location:

{{RootCmd|echo "EIX_CACHEFILE{{=}}%{EPREFIX}/var/cache/eix-portage.eix" >> /etc/eixrc/00-eixrc
|eix --dump {{!}} grep EIX_CACHEFILE|output=<pre>
EIX_CACHEFILE=%{EPREFIX}/var/cache/eix-portage.eix
# EIX_CACHEFILE=%{EPREFIX}/var/cache/eix/portage.eix</pre>}}

One side effect is needing to run {{c|eix-update}} after reboot which will take a few seconds.

==== Searching for installed packages ====

Search for installed packages using the <code>-I</code> option:

{{Cmd|eix -I kernel|output=<pre>
[I] sys-kernel/genkernel
     Available versions:  3.4.16 (~)3.4.16.1 3.4.20 (~)3.4.21.2 (~)3.4.22.1 (~)3.4.23.1 (~)3.4.24 3.4.24_p1 (~)3.4.25.1 (~)3.4.26 (~)3.4.27 (~)3.4.28 (~)3.4.29 (~)3.4.32 (~)3.4.33.1 (~)3.4.34 (~)3.4.35 (~)3.4.36 **9999 {{crypt cryptsetup ibm selinux}}

     Description:         Gentoo automatic kernel building scripts
</pre>}}

==== Searching in package descriptions ====

To search in package descriptions use the <code>-S</code> option. It is possible to print out results in a compact list using <code>-c</code>:

{{Cmd|eix -S -c corba|output=<pre>
[N] dev-ada/polyorb (~2.1.0): A CORBA implementation for Ada
[I] dev-libs/libIDL (0.8.14{tbz2}@07/10/11): CORBA tree builder

[I] gnome-base/orbit (2.14.19-r1(2){tbz2}@07/10/11): ORBit2 is a high-performance CORBA ORB
[N] net-misc/mico (~2.3.13-r5): A freely available and fully compliant implementation of the CORBA standard
[N] net-misc/omniORB (4.1.4-r1): A robust, high-performance CORBA 2 ORB
</pre>}}

==== Searching in package categories ====

Search for certain category using the <code>-C</code> option and print out the results in a compact list (<code>-c</code>):

{{Cmd|eix -C -c app-officeext|output=<pre>
[N] app-officeext/barcode (1.3.5.0): Extension for reading barcodes

[N] app-officeext/texmaths (0.35): LaTeX Equation Editor for LibreOffice
</pre>}}

==== Searching by license ====

Search for packages that are licensed under a specific license or subset of licenses using the <code>-L</code> option. For example's sake let the license be an End-User License Agreement (a type of proprietary license), or EULA and let's limit the results to the games-rpg category (as without a category limitation the results would be too long to fit comfortably in this article):

{{Cmd|eix -Cc games-rpg -L "EULA"|output=<pre>
[N] games-rpg/arx-fatalis-data ((~)1.21-r3): Arx Fatalis data files
[N] games-rpg/nwn (1.69-r1): role-playing game set in a huge medieval fantasy world of Dungeons and Dragons
[N] games-rpg/nwn-data (1.29-r5): Neverwinter Nights Data Files
[N] games-rpg/runescape-launcher (2.2.4): Official RuneScape NXT client launcher
</pre>}}

==== Excluding results ====

One can exclude results that, for example, have EULA in their license field using the <code>--not</code> option:

{{Cmd|eix --not -L "EULA"}}

(output not shown as it is too long).

==== Searching for installed obsolete packages ====

Search for obsolete packages on the system using the {{c|eix-test-obsolete}} command (If will in fact search for packages not installed but mentioned in the config files.):

{{Cmd|eix-test-obsolete|output=<pre>

=== Format strings ===

This is probably the most powerful aspect of {{c|eix}}, but the documentation is hard to understand. {{c|eix}} has a mini-language for specifying more precise queries and output formats than are possible using only the basic options. The format string is specified as the option argument to the <code>--format</code> option. There are basically two major concepts: properties and variables.

* '''Properties:''' Each package has a set of associated properties that can either be printed or used as part of a predicate in a conditional block.
* '''Variables:''' A variable can be any environment variable set in the environment of eix, or any of the variables printed from the output of {{c|eix --dump}}.

==== Category/name-version and license ====

When creating distributed media {{c|eix}} can be used to output a versioned package list along with the associated license information:

{{Cmd|NAMEVERSION{{=}}"<category>/<name>-<version>" eix -I --format 'Package: <installedversions:NAMEVERSION> {{!}} License: <licenses>\n'}}

==== Conditional blocks ====

Conditional blocks take can 3 forms, each with an optional RHS, each of which can be optionally negated:

{{CodeBox|title=If-then string comparison|<pre>{[!]PROPERTY=RHS}TCODE{}</pre>}}
{{CodeBox|title=If-then predicate|<pre>{[!]PROPERTY}TCODE{}</pre>}}
{{CodeBox|title=If-then-else string comparison|<pre>{[!]PROPERTY=RHS}TCODE{else}FCODE{}</pre>}}
{{CodeBox|title=If-then-else predicate|<pre>{[!]PROPERTY}TCODE{else}FCODE{}</pre>}}
{{CodeBox|title=Assignment|<pre>{[!]*VARIABLE=RHS}</pre>}}
{{CodeBox|title=Assign 1 or empty string|<pre>{[!]*VARIABLE}</pre>}}

== Tips ==

=== Tmux and Screen users should disable status line updates ===

When using {{c|tmux}} with automatic window renaming enabled (that is <code>set -g automatic-rename on</code> has been ran in the {{c|tmux}} configuration file) or {{c|screen}}, status line updates should be disabled. Otherwise, every time {{c|eix-update}} is ran the title of the window will be renamed to something like "eix-update: Finished*".

To disable status line updates, run the following command:

{{RootCmd|<nowiki>echo "NOSTATUSLINE=true" >> /etc/eixrc/00-eixrc</nowiki>}}
