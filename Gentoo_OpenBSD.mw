Gentoo OpenBSD (or Gentoo/OBSD, or G/OBSD) was an effort to create a complete OpenBSD-based Gentoo system, sharing the complete administration facilities of Gentoo with the reliability of the OpenBSD kernel and userland.

Official Gentoo OpenBSD logo can be found [[Project:Artwork/Artwork#Gentoo.2FOpenBSD_logo|here]].

A stage3 was offered for Gentoo OpenBSD, so installation was possible without the need for a regular OpenBSD installation. To attempt to install Gentoo OpenBSD, see the [[Gentoo OpenBSD/Install Guide|install guide]].
