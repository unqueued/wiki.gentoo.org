This article is based on a [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-965190.html posting in the Gentoo Forums] and explains how to use dhcpcd for complete network stack management.

== 设置 ==

Make sure [[Dhcpcd|dhcpcd]] is installed. Next, add it to the default runlevel and start the service:

{{RootCmd
|rc-update add dhcpcd default
|/etc/init.d/dhcpcd start
}}

This setup deviates from the default networking instructions in the Gentoo Handbook. It has the advantage that it provides automatic switching between wired and wireless network interfaces.

== 无线 ==

For wireless use {{c|wpa_supplicant}}. Either
* [https://gentoo.org/support/news-items/2016-01-08-some-dhcpcd-hooks-are-now-examples.html copy the 10-wpa_supplicant] hook into the {{Path|dhcpcd-hooks}} directory and restart dhcpcd, or
* have [[wpa_supplicant]] configured with the [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1036958-start-9.html CONFIG_MATCH_IFACE] option and run it as a service

To install the hook:

{{RootCmd|cp /usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks/10-wpa_supplicant /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks|/etc/init.d/dhcpcd restart}}

{{Important|Do not add wpa_supplicant to any runlevel if using the hook.}}

To use the {{c|wpa_supplicant}} approach, see the [[Wpa_supplicant#Setup_for_dhcpcd_as_network_manager|wpa_supplicant's Gentoo wiki page]].

== Testing ==

Stop {{c|dhcpcd}} and {{c|wpa_supplicant}}, then start {{c|dhcpcd}} with debugging enabled and in the foreground to see {{c|dhcpcd}} starting the connection.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dhcpcd stop
|killall wpa_supplicant
|dhcpcd -dB
|output=<pre>
dhcpcd[23772]: version 6.4.5 starting
dhcpcd[23772]: udev: starting
dhcpcd[23772]: dev: loaded udev
...
...
</pre>}}

== Static IP address ==

In case the network interface card should be configured with a [[Static_Routing|static IP address]], type it into the [[dhcpcd-ui#Usage|graphical user interface]].  Without the [[dhcpcd-ui#Usage|graphical user interface]], entries can also be [http://roy.marples.name/man/html5/dhcpcd.conf.html manually added] to {{Path|/etc/dhcpcd.conf}} as described in [[Dhcpcd#Static_IP_addresses]].

== Migration from Gentoo net.* scripts ==

When migrating from [[netifrc|Gentoo's net.* scripts]] it is essential to remove the {{Path|net.*}} scripts from the runlevels.

{{Cmd|rc-config list {{!}} grep 'wpa_supplicant\{{!}}dhcpcd\{{!}}net.'|output=<pre>
  net.wlp8s0                default
  dhcpcd                    default</pre>}}

Any match starting with <code>net.</code> must not have a runlevel assigned. In the above example, {{Path|net.wlp8s0}} needs to be removed.

{{RootCmd|rc-update del net.wlp8s0
|/etc/init.d/net.wlp8s0 stop}}

Once the network setup works well, it is possible to completely remove the old Gentoo {{Path|net.*}} scripts. To do so, disable the <code>netifrc</code> useflag, re-emerge OpenRC and finally unmerge {{Package|net-misc/netifrc}}:

{{RootCmd|echo 'sys-apps/openrc -netifrc' >> /etc/portage/package.use
|emerge --ask --newuse --oneshot sys-apps/openrc
|emerge --ask --depclean net-misc/netifrc}}

Also the old configuration files and symlinks can be removed:

{{RootCmd|rm /etc/conf.d/net
|rm /etc/init.d/net.*}}

== Network dependent services ==

Manipulating [[Network_dependent_services|network dependent services]] by {{c|dhcpcd}} is no longer supported since openrc-0.16.4.

== Graphical User interface ==

A [[dhcpcd-ui|dhcpcd graphical user interface]] is provided by {{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd-ui}}.
