'''Deepin Desktop Environment''' is an elegant, easy to use and reliable domestic desktop evironment released by Deepin Technology Co., Ltd. It is primarily written in Golang and Qt5. It was originally written for Deepin Linux, and is ported to Gentoo. 

== Prerequisites ==
=== Add deepin Overlay to your system ===
{{c|DDE}} currently resides in the {{c|deepin}} ebuild repository. There are three primary methods for installing repositories in Gentoo:
==== Option 1: Install by eselect repository ====
First emerge {{Package|app-eselect/eselect-repository}} and {{Package|dev-vcs/git}}:

{{Emerge|--noreplace app-eselect/eselect-repository dev-vcs/git}}
     
Then add the overlay and sync:
{{RootCmd
|eselect repository add deepin git https://github.com/zhtengw/deepin-overlay.git
|emerge --sync deepin
}}

==== Option 2: Install by layman ====
First emerge and configure [[layman]], with the {{c|git}} USE flag enabled.

Then add the deepin overlay:
{{RootCmd|layman -L && layman -a deepin}}

==== Option 3: Manually add repos.conf ====
Create a file in the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf/|/etc/portage/repos.conf/]]}} directory (create the {{Path|repos.conf}} directory first if it does not exist) called {{Path|deepin.conf}}. Fill the file's contents with the following code:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/repos.conf/deepin.conf|lang=ini|1=
[deepin]
location = /usr/local/overlay/deepin
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/zhtengw/deepin-overlay.git
auto-sync = yes
}}
