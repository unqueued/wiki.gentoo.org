'''Ansible''' is a configuration management system written in [[Python]]. It can be used for automating machine deployments.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-admin/ansible}}:

{{Emerge|app-admin/ansible}}

== Configuration ==

The app-admin/ansible-1.9.4 ebuild will not generate the basic configuration. The default inventory file is named hosts should be in the /etc/ansible directory

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /etc/ansible
|nano /etc/ansible/hosts
}}

This file contains the managed computers organized in groups.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/ansible/hosts|title=Sample inventory file|1=
[all:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python2.7  # IMPORTANT

[servers]
myserver01
myserver02
myserver03

[workstations]
evapc ansible_ssh_user=myuser ansible_ssh_port=9000
joepc ansible_ssh_user=myuser
mypc ansible_ssh_user=myuser ansible_connection=local
}}

With <code>ansible_ssh_user=</code> and <code>ansible_ssh_port=</code> remote users and ssh ports can be specified per hosts. From 2.0 version they are deprecated, use <code>ansible_user</code> and <code>ansible_port</code> instead.
The first two lines are crucial to explicitly set Ansible's python interpreter for all hosts, Ansible only works with python 2.7, and even is the <code>python_targets_python2_7</code> flag is set, it will use your system python by default. It is unnecessary if your system python is 2.7, but still recommended to avoid unexpected failure if you change it.  

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg|title=Default configuration|1=
# Default remote user
remote_user = root
# SSH timeout in seconds
timeout = 10
}}

=== Roles for Gentoo ===

Over 40 roles specifically for Gentoo can be found in the https://github.com/gentoo-ansible project.

== Usage ==

Check is ansible can manage remote machine with given user:

{{RootCmd|ansible evapc -u myuser -m ping}}

Get info from remote machine, what can be used later in playbooks:

{{RootCmd|ansible evapc -u myuser -m setup}}

Run {{c|emerge --sync}} on evapc under myuser via {{c|sudo}}:

{{RootCmd|ansible evapc -s -u myuser -m command -a "emerge --sync"}}

|-
! Option
! Description
|-
| <code>-u</code>
| Specifies the user, if absent ansible will search in your inventory file for default user associated to the given host, if not any it will use the default specified in the {{Path|/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg}} file, if there is no such an entry it will use the current username. 
|-
| <code>-m</code>
| Specifies the module to be invoked.
|-
| <code>-a</code>
| Specifies the arguments to passed to the module.
|}

The {{c|ansible-doc}} command can be used to read module documentation. For example, to list available modules:

{{Cmd|ansible-doc -l}}

To print out info about the ping module:
{{Cmd|ansible-doc ping}}
