<noinclude><languages/></noinclude><translate>Network device names <code>eth0</code>, <code>eth1</code>, etc. as provided by the kernel could be changed on boot (see {{c|dmesg}}) by the {{Path|/lib/udev/rules.d/80-net-name-slot.rules}} udev rule.

To keep the classic  naming this rule can be overwritten with an equally named empty file in the {{Path|/etc/udev/rules.d}} directory:
{{RootCmd
|touch /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-name-slot.rules
}}</translate>
