'''avahi''' is a zeroconf service discovery and publishing program.

== Installation ==

=== Server ===

==== USE flags ====

{{USEflag|package=net-dns/avahi}}

==== Emerge ====

Install {{Package|net-dns/avahi}}:

{{Emerge|net-dns/avahi}}

=== Client ===

==== Emerge ====

Gentoo contains the client component of Avahi that enables one to test this service. 

Install {{Package|sys-auth/nss-mdns}}:

{{emerge|sys-auth/nss-mdns}}

== Configuration ==

=== Server ===

==== Services ====

===== systemd =====

Enable the server to start whenever {{c|systemd}} thinks it is appropriate:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service}}

If you want to use it right away, also start the service:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start avahi-daemon.service}}

===== OpenRC =====

Be sure to add the service to the default runlevel for the server daemon to start on system boot. Do so with the {{c|rc-update}} command:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add avahi-daemon default}}

Start the service (without restarting) with the {{c|rc-service}} command:

{{RootCmd|rc-service avahi-daemon start}}
Add the appropriate mdns into the hosts line in {{Path|/etc/nsswitch.conf}}, An example line looks like:

=== Client ===

==== Files ====

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/nsswitch.conf|1=
hosts:       files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4
}}

To also enable IPv6 support, change the line to:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/nsswitch.conf|1=
hosts:       files mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns
}}

Once this is installed it should be possible to ping the hostname of the machine appending <code>.local</code>. For example: 

{{RootCmd|ping hostname.local}}
