These are my notes on getting Gentoo fully functional on the Lenovo X1 Carbon, 3rd generation.

== Kernel ==
=== Suspend / Resume ===
In order for suspend / resume (particularly the resume) to work properly, you must enable the following:
 Device Drivers ->
   Character devices ->
     <Y|M> TPM Hardware Support ->
       <Y|M> TPM Interface Specification 1.2 Interface / TPM 2.0 FIFO Interface

=== Resetting chip after gpu hang error ===
Error messages like the following:
 drm/i915: Resetting chip after gpu hang
...seem to be caused by the enablement of Intel DMA remapping devices.  To fix, you can either <b>not</b> enable them by default in your kernel:
 Device Drivers ->
   IOMMU Hardware Support ->
     Support for Intel IOMMU using DMA Remapping Devices ->
       <N> Enable Intel DMA Remapping Devices by default

...or (probably easier) disable them on the kernel command line with the following option:
 intel_iommu=off
