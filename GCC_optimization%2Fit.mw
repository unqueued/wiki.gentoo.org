Questa guida costituisce un'introduzione all'ottimizzazione del codice compilato utilizzando valori sicuri per le variabili CFLAGS e CXXFLAGS. Inoltre viene descritta la teoria a fondamento dell'ottimizzazione in generale.

== Introduzione ==

=== Cosa sono CFLAGS e CXXFLAGS? ===

<var>CFLAGS</var> and <var>CXXFLAGS</var> are environment variables that are used to tell the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) what kinds of switches to use when compiling source code. The <var>CFLAGS</var> variable is used for compiling code written in C, while the <var>CXXFLAGS</var> variable is for code written in C++. 

Possono essere usate per ridurre la quantità di messaggi per il debug, per incrementare i livelli dei messaggi di avvertimento e ovviamente per ottimizzare il codice prodotto. Il [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Invoking-GCC.html#Invoking-GCC manuale GCC] contiene una lista completa delle opzioni disponibili, e per ciascuna di esse viene fornita una spiegazione del motivo per cui vengono usate.

=== Come vengono usate? ===

<var>CFLAGS</var> and <var>CXXFLAGS</var> can be used in two ways. First, they can be used per-program with Makefiles generated by the {{c|automake}} program. 

However, this should not be done when installing packages found in the Portage tree. Instead, for Gentoo-based machines, set the <var>CFLAGS</var> and <var>CXXFLAGS</var> variables in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} This way all packages will be compiled using the options specified in {{Path|make.conf}}

{{CodeBox|title=Setting CFLAGS in /etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-march=athlon64 -O2 -pipe"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
}}

{{Important|While it is possible to have multiple lines in '''USE''' flags, having multiple lines in <var>CFLAGS</var> can and ''will'' result in problems with programs such as {{c|cmake}}. Make sure the CFLAGS declaration is on a single line, with as little whitespace as possible to avoid issues. See {{Bug|500034}} as an example.}}

As seen in the example above the <var>CXXFLAGS</var> variable is set to use all the options present in <var>CFLAGS</var>. Most every system should be configured in this manner; additional options for <var>CXXFLAGS</var> are ''extremely rare'' in common use cases.

=== Convinzioni errate ===

While <var>CFLAGS</var> and <var>CXXFLAGS</var> can be very effective means of getting source code to produce smaller and/or faster binaries, they can also impair the function of the code, bloat its size, slow down its execution time. Setting them incorrectly can even cause compilation failures! 

<var>CFLAGS</var> are not a magic bullet; they will not automatically make the system run faster or reduce the size of binaries on the disk. Adding too many flags in an attempt to optimize (or "rice") the system is a sure recipe for failure. The point of diminishing returns is reached rather quickly when dealing with <var>CFLAGS</var>. 

Despite the boasts and brags found on the internet, aggressive <var>CFLAGS</var> and <var>CXXFLAGS</var> are far more likely to harm binaries than to do any good. Keep in mind the flags are designed to be used at ''specific'' places for ''specific'' purposes. Few flags work as intended globally.

=== Pronto? ===

Being aware of the risks involved, take a look at some sane, safe optimizations. These will hold in good stead and will be endearing to developers the next time a problem  is reported on [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ Bugzilla]. (Developers will usually request the user to recompile a package with minimal <var>CFLAGS</var> to see if the problem persists. Remember: aggressive flags can ruin code!) 

== Ottimizzazione ==

=== Le basi ===

The goal behind <var>CFLAGS</var> and <var>CXXFLAGS</var> is to create code tailor-made to your system; it should function perfectly while being lean and fast, if possible. Sometimes these conditions are mutually exclusive, so this guide will stick to combinations known to work well. Ideally, they are the best available for any CPU architecture. For informational purposes, aggressive flag use will be covered later. Not every option listed on the GCC manual (there are hundreds) will be discussed, but basic, most common flags will be reviewed. 

{{Note|When unaware of what a flag does refer to the relevant chapter of the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options GCC manual]. If still stumped after viewing the manual, try a search engine or check out the [http://gcc.gnu.org/lists.html GCC mailing lists].}}

=== -march ===

The first and most important option is <code>-march</code>. This tells the compiler what code it should produce for the system's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture processor architecture] (or ''arch''); it tells GCC that it should produce code for a certain kind of CPU. Different CPUs have different capabilities, support different instruction sets, and have different ways of executing code. The <code>-march</code> flag will instruct the compiler to produce specific code for the system's CPU, with all its capabilities, features, instruction sets, quirks, and so on. 

Even though the <code>CHOST</code> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} specifies the general architecture used, <code>-march</code> should still be used so that programs can be optimized for the system specific processor. x86 and x86-64 CPUs (among others) should make use of the <code>-march</code> flag. 

What kind of CPU does the system have? To find out, run the following command: 

{{Cmd|cat /proc/cpuinfo}}

To get more details, including <code>march</code> and <code>mtune</code> values, use:

{{Cmd|<nowiki>gcc -c -Q -march=native --help=target</nowiki>}}

Now lets see <code>-march</code> in action. This example is for an older Pentium III chip: 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Pentium III example|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-march=pentium3"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
}}

Questo è invece un esempio per una CPU AMD a 64-bit: 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=AMD64 example|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-march=athlon64"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
}}

If the type of CPU is undetermined, or if the user does not know what setting to choose, it is possible use the <code>-march=native</code> setting. When this flag is used, GCC will attempt to detect the processor and automatically set appropriate flags for it. '''However, this should not be used when intending to compile packages for different CPUs!''' 

{{Warning|Do '''not''' use <code>-march{{=}}native</code> or <code>-mtune{{=}}native</code> in the <var>CFLAGS</var> or <var>CXXFLAGS</var> variables of {{Path|make.conf}} when compiling with {{c|[[Distcc#-march.3Dnative|distcc]]}}.}}

If compiling packages on one computer in order to run them on a different computer (such as when using a fast computer to build for an older, slower machine), then ''do not'' use <code>-march=native</code>. "Native" means that the code produced will run ''only'' on that type of CPU. The applications built with <code>-march=native</code> on an AMD Athlon 64 CPU will '''''not''''' be able to run on an old VIA C3 CPU. 

Also available are the <code>-mtune</code> and <code>-mcpu</code> flags. These flags are normally only used when there is no available <code>-march</code> option; certain processor architectures may require <code>-mtune</code> or even <code>-mcpu</code>. Unfortunately, GCC's behavior isn't very consistent with how each flag behaves from one architecture to the next. 

On x86 and x86-64 CPUs, <code>-march</code> will generate code specifically for that CPU using its available instruction sets and the correct ABI; it will have no backwards compatibility for older/different CPUs. Consider using <code>-mtune</code> when generating code for older CPUs such as i386 and i486. <code>-mtune</code> produces more generic code than <code>-march</code>; though it will tune code for a certain CPU, it does not take into account available instruction sets and ABI. Do not use <code>-mcpu</code> on x86 or x86-64 systems, as it is deprecated for those arches. 

Only non-x86/x86-64 CPUs (such as Sparc, Alpha, and PowerPC) may require <code>-mtune</code> or <code>-mcpu</code> instead of <code>-march</code>. On these architectures, <code>-mtune</code> / <code>-mcpu</code> will sometimes behave just like <code>-march</code> (on x86/x86-64) but with a different flag name. Again, GCC's behavior and flag naming is not consistent across architectures, so be sure to check the GCC [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Submodel-Options.html#Submodel-Options manual] to determine which one should be used. 

{{Note|For more suggested <code>-march</code> / <code>-mtune</code> / <code>-mcpu</code> settings, please read chapter 5 of the appropriate [[HandBook:Main_Page|Gentoo Installation Handbook]] for the arch. Also, read the GCC manual's list of [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Submodel-Options.html#Submodel-Options architecture-specific options], as well as more detailed explanations about the differences between <code>-march</code>, <code>-mcpu</code>, and <code>-mtune</code>.}}

=== -O ===

Next up is the <code>-O</code> variable. This variable controls the overall level of optimization. Changing this value will make the code compilation take more time and will use much more memory, especially as the level of optimization is increased. 

There are seven <code>-O</code> settings: <code>-O0</code>, <code>-O1</code>, <code>-O2</code>, <code>-O3</code>, <code>-Os</code>, <code>-Og</code>, and <code>-Ofast</code>. Only use one of them in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}

Con la sola eccezione di <code>-O0</code>, ciascuna delle impostazioni <code>-O</code> attiva alcune opzioni aggiuntive. Assicurarsi quindi di leggere il capitolo del manuale GCC sulle [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options opzioni per l'ottimizzazione] per capire quali opzioni vengono attivate per ciascuno dei livelli <code>-O</code> e qual'è la loro funzione. 

Let us examine each optimization level: 

*  <code>-O0</code>: This level (that is the letter "O" followed by a zero) turns off optimization entirely and is the default if no <code>-O</code> level is specified in <var>CFLAGS</var> or <var>CXXFLAGS</var>. This reduces compilation time and can improve debugging info, but some applications will not work properly without optimization enabled. This option is not recommended except for debugging purposes.

*  <code>-O1</code>: the most basic optimization level. The compiler will try to produce faster, smaller code without taking much compilation time. It is basic, but it should get the job done all the time.

*  <code>-O2</code>: A step up from <code>-O1</code>. The ''recommended'' level of optimization unless the system has special needs. <code>-O2</code> will activate a few more flags in addition to the ones activated by <code>-O1</code>. With <code>-O2</code>, the compiler will attempt to increase code performance without compromising on size, and without taking too much compilation time.

*  <code>-O3</code>: the highest level of optimization possible. It enables optimizations that are expensive in terms of compile time and memory usage.  Compiling with <code>-O3</code> is not a guaranteed way to improve performance, and in fact, in many cases, can slow down a system due to larger binaries and increased memory usage. <code>-O3</code> is also known to break several packages. Using <code>-O3</code> is not recommended.

*  <code>-Os</code>: optimizes code for size. It activates all <code>-O2</code> options that do not increase the size of the generated code. It can be useful for machines that have extremely limited disk storage space and/or CPUs with small cache sizes.

* <code>-Og</code>: Questa opzione è stata introdotta con GCC 4.8. Essa soddisfa il bisogno di ridurre i tempi della compilazione e quello di migliorare la capacità di effettuare il debug mantenendo però un ragionevole livello prestazionale in fase di esecuzione. Complessivamente con <code>-Og</code> l'attività di sviluppo dovrebbe risultare migliore rispetto a <code>-O0</code>. Si noti che <code>-Og</code> non implica <code>-g</code>; <code>-Og</code> si limita semplicemente a disattivare le ottimizzazioni che hanno ripercussioni negative sull'attività di debug.

* <code>-Ofast</code>: Si tratta di un'opzione introdotta con GCC 4.7. Essa consiste della somma di <code>-O3</code> con <code>-ffast-math</code>, <code>-fno-protect-parens</code> e <code>-fstack-arrays</code>. <code>-Ofast</code> viola la conformità stretta agli standard e pertanto non è consigliata.

As previously mentioned, <code>-O2</code> is the recommended optimization level. If package compilation fails and while not using <code>-O2</code>, try rebuilding with that option. As a fallback option, try setting the <var>CFLAGS</var> and <var>CXXFLAGS</var> to a lower optimization level, such as <code>-O1</code> or even <code>-O0 -g2 -ggdb</code> (for error reporting and checking for possible problems).

=== -pipe ===

A common flag is <code>-pipe</code>. This flag has no effect on the generated code, but it makes the compilation process ''faster''. It tells the compiler to use pipes instead of temporary files during the different stages of compilation, which uses more memory. On systems with low memory, GCC might get killed. In those cases do not use this flag. 

=== -fomit-frame-pointer ===

This is a very common flag designed to reduce generated code size. It is turned on at all levels of <code>-O</code> (except <code>-O0</code>) on architectures where doing so does not interfere with debugging (such as x86-64), but it may need to activated. In that case add it to the flags. Though the GCC manual does not specify all architectures, it is turned on by using the <code>-O</code> option. It's still necessary to explicitly enable the <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code> option, to activate it on x86-32 with GCC up to version 4.6, or when using <code>-Os</code> on x86-32 with any version of GCC. However, using <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code> will make debugging hard or impossible. 

In particular, it makes troubleshooting applications written in Java much harder, though Java is not the only code affected by using this flag. So while the flag can help, it also makes debugging harder; backtraces in particular will be useless. When not doing software debugging and no other debugging-related <var>CFLAGS</var> such as <code>-ggdb</code> have been used, then try using <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>. 

{{Important/it|''Non'' combinare <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code> con l'opzione <code>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</code>. L'uso di quest'ultima è scoraggiato in quanto la prima svolge già da sola la propria funzione in modo corretto. Inoltre <code>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</code> è nota per avere conseguenze negative sulle prestazioni del codice.}}

=== -msse, -msse2, -msse3, -mmmx, -m3dnow ===

These flags enable the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions Streaming SIMD Extentions] (SSE), [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2 SSE2], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSSE3 SSE3], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set) MMX], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dnow 3DNow!] instruction sets for x86 and x86-64 architectures. These are useful primarily in multimedia, gaming, and other floating point-intensive computing tasks, though they also contain several other mathematical enhancements. These instruction sets are found in more modern CPUs. 

{{Important|Be sure to see if the CPU supports these instruction sets by running <kbd>cat /proc/cpuinfo</kbd>. The output will include any supported additional instruction sets. Note that '''pni''' is just a different name for SSE3.}}

Normally none of these flags need to be added to {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}, as long as the system is using the correct <code>-march</code> (for example, <code>-march=nocona</code> implies <code>-msse3</code>). Some notable exceptions are newer VIA and AMD64 CPUs that support instructions not implied by <code>-march</code> (such as SSE3). For CPUs like these additional flags will need to be enabled where appropriate after checking {{Path|/proc/cpuinfo}}. 

{{Note|Check the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html list of x86 and x86-64-specific flags] to see which of these instruction sets are activated by the proper CPU type flag. If an instruction is listed, then it does not need to be separately specified; it will be turned on by using the proper <code>-march</code> setting.}}

== Domande frequenti ==

=== Ma ottengo migliori prestazioni con -funroll-loops -fomg-optimize! ===

No, you only ''think'' you do because someone has convinced you that more flags are better. Aggressive flags will only hurt applications when used system-wide. Even the GCC [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options manual] says that using <code>-funroll-loops</code> and <code>-funroll-all-loops</code> will make code larger and run more slowly. Yet for some reason, these two flags, along with <code>-ffast-math</code>, <code>-fforce-mem</code>, <code>-fforce-addr</code>, and similar flags, continue to be very popular among ricers who want the biggest bragging rights. 

La verità è che si tratta di opzioni aggressive e pericolose. Si invita il lettore a controllare il [[https://forums.gentoo.org/ forum]] e il [[https://bugs.gentoo.org/ bugzilla]] di Gentoo per vedere quali sono le conseguenze di queste opzioni. Niente di buono! 

You do not need to use those flags globally in <var>CFLAGS</var> or <var>CXXFLAGS</var>. They will only hurt performance. They may make you sound like you have a high-performance system running on the bleeding edge, but they don't do anything but bloat the code and get your bugs marked INVALID or WONTFIX. 

Non c'è bisogno di utilizzare tali opzioni. '''Non usarle'''. Limitarsi alle opzioni di base: <code>-march</code>, <code>-O</code> e <code>-pipe</code>.

=== Livelli per -O maggiori di 3 ===

Alcuni utenti si vantano di ottenere prestazioni maggiori usando <code>-O4</code>, <code>-O9</code> e simili. In realtà i livelli per <code>-O</code> maggiori di 3 non hanno alcun effetto. Il compilatore accetta CFLAGS come <code>-O4</code>, ma in questi casi esso si limita ad applicare le ottimizzazioni del livello <code>-O3</code> e niente di più. 

Need more proof? Examine the [https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc/trunk/gcc/opts.c?view=markup source code]: 

{{CodeBox|title=-O source code|lang=bash|1=
if (optimize >= 3)
    {
      flag_inline_functions = 1;
      flag_unswitch_loops = 1;
      flag_gcse_after_reload = 1;
      /* Allow even more virtual operators.  */
      set_param_value ("max-aliased-vops", 1000);
      set_param_value ("avg-aliased-vops", 3);
    }
}}

Il lettore può osservare che i valori maggiori di 3 sono trattati allo stesso modo che per <code>-O3</code>.

=== What about compiling outside the target machine? ===

Some readers might wonder if compiling outside the target machine with a strictly inferior CPU or GCC sub-architecture will result in inferior optimization results (compared to a native compilation). The answer is simple: '''No'''.  Regardless of the actual hardware on which the compilation takes place and the CHOST for which GCC was built, as long as the same arguments are used <small>(except for <code>-march=native</code>)</small> and the same version of GCC is used <small>(although minor version might be different)</small>, the resulting optimizations are strictly the same.

To exemplify, if Gentoo is installed on a machine whose GCC's CHOST is ''i686-pc-linux-gnu'', and a [[Distcc]] server is setup on another computer whose GCC's CHOST is ''i486-linux-gnu'', then there is no need to be afraid that the results would be less optimal because of the strictly inferior sub-architecture of the remote compiler and/or hardware. The result would be as optimized as a native build, as long as the same options are passed to both compilers (and the <code>-march</code> parameter doesn't get a <code>native</code> argument).  In this particular case the target architecture needs to be specified explicitly as explained in [[Distcc#-march.3Dnative|Distcc and -march=native]].

The only difference in behavior between two GCC versions built targeting different sub-architectures is the implicit default argument for the <code>-march</code> parameter, which is derived from the GCC's CHOST when not explicitly provided in the command line.

=== Opzioni ridondanti ===

Spesso le CFLAGS e le CXXFLAGS che sono attivate ai vari livelli di <code>-O</code> vengono specificate in modo ridondante nel file {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. Alcune volte lo si fa per ignoranza, ma in altri casi lo scopo è quello di aggirare la sostituzione o il filtraggio delle opzioni. 

Il filtraggio e la sostituzione delle opzioni vengono svolti da molti ebuild. Solitamente lo si fa perché alcuni pacchetti non possono essere compilati a determinati livelli di <code>-O</code>, oppure perché il codice sorgente è troppo sensibile per permettere l'uso di opzioni aggiuntive. Tali ebuild possono filtrare alcune CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS o possono sostituire <code>-O</code> con un livello differente. 

Il [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/functions/src_compile/build-environment/index.html Gentoo Developer Manual] spiega nel dettaglio in che modo funziona il filtraggio e la sostituzione delle opzioni e dove essi hanno luogo. 

È possibile aggirare il filtraggio delle opzioni attivate ad un certo livello di <code>-O</code>, come ad esempio <code>-O3</code>, nel seguente modo: 

{{CodeBox|title=Specifying redundant CFLAGS|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-O3 -finline-functions -funswitch-loops"
}}

Questa, tuttavia, '''non è affatto una buona idea'''. Le CFLAGS sono filtrate per una ragione ben precisa! Tali opzioni vengono filtrate perché altrimenti non si è sicuri di riuscire a compilare un pacchetto correttamente. Ovviamente ''non'' è sicuro compilare l'intero sistema con <code>-O3</code> se alcune delle opzioni attivate da tale livello causano problemi con certi pacchetti. Il lettore non dovrebbe cercare di "raggirare" gli sviluppatori che mantengono questi pacchetti. ''Occorre fidarsi degli sviluppatori''. Il filtraggio e la sostituzione delle opzioni viene fatto ad esclusivo vantaggio dell'utente finale. Se un ebuild specifica opzioni alternative non bisogna pertanto provare ad aggirarle. 

Se si sceglie di compilare un pacchetto con opzioni inaccettabili è molto probabile che si avranno ulteriori problemi successivamente. Quando l'utente segnala un problema sul Bugzilla le opzioni che si usano in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} sono chiaramente visibili a tutti e gli sviluppatori chiederanno senz'altro di ricompilare il pacchetto senza le opzioni problematiche. Si può evitare il fastidio di dover ricompilare tali pacchetti se si evita in primo luogo di utilizzare opzioni ridondanti in questa maniera. Non si deve assumere di saperne di più rispetto agli sviluppatori.

=== LDFLAGS ===

The Gentoo developers have already set basic, safe <var>LDFLAGS</var> in the base profiles, so they do not need to be changed.

=== Opzioni specifiche per un singolo pacchetto ===

{{Warning/it|Utilizzare opzioni specifiche per un singolo pacchetto rende più complicato il debug e l'assistenza. Se si sceglie di continuare per questa strada e si vuole segnalare un problema agli sviluppatori si faccia esplicito riferimento al fatto che si sta utilizzando questa funzionalità, e si indichino inoltre le modifiche che sono state apportate.}}
