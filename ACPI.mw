'''ACPI''' ('''A'''dvanced '''C'''onfiguration and '''P'''ower Management '''I'''nterface) is a [[power management]] system. It is part of the [[BIOS]].

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Power management and ACPI options  --->
    [*] Power Management support

== Software ==
[[:Category:Desktop environment|Desktop environments]] react on the common events generated by ACPI. If you don't use a desktop environment or want to react on special events, install {{Package|sys-power/acpid}}:
{{Emerge|acpid}}

== Configuration ==
The scripts in {{Path|/etc/acpi}} define how to react on ACPI events. You can edit them or add more.

=== Service ===
You can now start acpid:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/acpid start}}
To start acpid at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add acpid}}
