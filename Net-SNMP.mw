From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

'' '''Net-SNMP''' is a suite of software for using and deploying the '''SNMP''' protocol (v1, v2c and v3 and the AgentX subagent protocol). It supports IPv4, IPv6, IPX, AAL5, Unix domain sockets and other transports. It contains a generic client library, a suite of command line applications, a highly extensible SNMP agent, perl modules and python modules.''

This document describes how to install and to configure SNMP '''Read Only''' access to your equipment. 
The SNMP version used in the configuration below is '''SNMP v2c'''.

== Installation ==
Portage knows the global USE flag ''snmp'' for enabling support for SNMP in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|net-analyzer/net-snmp}} automatically:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="... snmp ..."
}}

The USE flags of net-snmp are:
{{USEflag
|package=net-analyzer/net-snmp
|X+yes+no
|bzip2+yes
|doc
|elf
|ipv6+yes
|lm_sensors
|mfd-rewrites
|minimal++yes
|perl+yes
|python+yes
|rpm+yes
|selinux
|ssl+yes
|tcpd+yes
|ucd-compat
|zlib+yes
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

You want to install net-snmp yourself, if it isn't already pulled in:
{{Emerge|net-snmp}}

== Configuration ==
Edit {{Path|/etc/snmpd/snmpd.conf}} and add the ''community'' and the ''IP access list''.

{{Warning|NEVER use the default communities which are called '''public''' and '''private''', these are considered a potential security risk, also if SNMP access is secured by an IP access list}}

* Substitute the SNMP community ''my-own-SNMP-community'' with your own SNMP community.
* Substitute the ''10.255.255.0/24'' network with your own IP network where SNMP access should be allowed from.
* Substitute the ''syslocation'' and ''syscontact'' with your own valid data.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf|1=
com2sec local     127.0.0.1/32          my-own-SNMP-community
com2sec local     10.255.255.0/24       my-own-SNMP-community
#
group MyROGroup v1         local
group MyROGroup v2c        local
group MyROGroup usm        local
view all    included  .1                               80
access MyROGroup "" any     noauth    exact  all    none   none
#
syslocation London
syscontact Admin {Admin@example.com}
}}

It is suggested to put valid data into the ''syslocation'' and ''syscontact'' fields, so in a support case when your hardware is monitored by a NMS (Network Management System) the responsible staff has the data right there where it is needed (in the NMS). 

In a large networks or enterprises it is hard to describe for the network staff where particular network equipment has been placed. Sometimes there is a high fluctuation of the network staff, and after some time network equipment gets lost because nobody knows anymore where it has been placed, or whom to contact when a network equipment has failed. 

Be aware to put valid data in there, your network staff will be thankful if you do so. It helps to resolve network outages quicker.

== Starting the daemon ==
To start the SNMP daemon use  following command:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/snmpd start}}

== Testing SNMP access ==
To test SNMP access or rather to poll SNMP data your SNMP client has to be within the allowed IP range of the previously configured access list (here 10.255.255.0/24).
* Substitute the IP '''192.168.10.254''' with the target host where SNMP access has been enabled
* Substitute the SNMP community '''my-own-SNMP-community''' with your own SNMP community

{{Cmd|snmpwalk -v2c -c my-own-SNMP-community 192.168.10.254}}

== Troubleshooting ==
Verify the SNMP daemon is running on a particular host:
{{RootCmd|netstat -tulpen {{!}} grep 161|output=<pre>
udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:161             0.0.0.0:*                           0          4307       2393/snmpd
</pre>}}

* SNMP v1 and SNMP v2c uses UDP
* SNMP v3 uses TCP
