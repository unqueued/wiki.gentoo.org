== overview ==
The ''Dell XPS 13 (9365)'' is a 2-in-1 convertible ultrabook released by Dell in early 2017 and has excellent Linux compatability with only two minor outstanding issues.

The following is a list of all PCI devices connected to the machine.

== updating the BIOS ==
As of July 2018, the current version of the BIOS is 1.5.0. Instructions to update the system BIOS are as follows:
# Download the latest version of the BIOS from the Dell support website [https://www.dell.com/support/home/ca/en/cabsdt1/drivers/driversdetails?driverId=F04F3 here].
# Copy the downloaded file to the '''root''' of the EFI System Partition.
{{Note|In this example, we will assume the EFI partition is at <kbd>/dev/nvme0n1p2</kbd> and that this partition is mounted to <kbd>/boot</kbd>. This may change based on the chosen partition layout chosen at the time of installation.{{Cmd|lsblk --paths|output=<pre>

# Reboot the system, pressing the F12 button when the ''Dell'' logo appears to enter the BIOS configuration menu.
# On the main menu of the UEFI screen, select the red '''BIOS Update''' button.
# You will be presented with the ''Flash BIOS'' menu. Select '''Flash from file'''.
# You will be prompted to select a file using a file browser. Select the EFI system partition that you copied the update file to, and select the update file.
# Once you have selected the correct BIOS update file, select the blue '''Submit''' option. You will be taken back to the previous ''Flash BIOS'' menu.
# After verifying that the correct BIOS update file has been selected, select '''Update BIOS!'''. You will be prompted with one last confirmation. Select '''Confirm Update BIOS!'''
# This step will take several minutes to flash the new BIOS. The system will reboot automatically when the process has completed. Once the system has finished rebooting, you may remove the BIOS update file from the EFI partition.
