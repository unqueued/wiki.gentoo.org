{{Important|As of December 2018, Alacritty is still in its alpha stage of development<ref>[https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/master/README.md alacritty/README.md at master Â· jwilm/alacritty], github.com. Retrieved on December 6, 2018</ref>.}}

'''Alacritty''' [[Article description::is a [[Terminal emulator|terminal emulator]] focused on simplicity and performance.]] The performance goal means it should be faster than any other terminal emulators available. The simplicity goal means it doesn't have features such as tabs or splits (which can be better provided by a [[Window manager|window manager]])<ref>Joe Wilm, [https://jwilm.io/blog/announcing-alacritty/ Announcing Alacritty, a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator], jwilm.io. Retrieved on December 6, 2018</ref>.

Alacritty is written in [[Wikipedia:Rust (programming language)|Rust]] and GPU-accelerated using [[Wikipedia:OpenGL|OpenGL]].

== USE fags ==

{{USEflag|package=x11-terms/alacritty}}

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|x11-terms/alacritty}} package:

{{Emerge|x11-terms/alacritty}}

== Configuration ==

Following paths are searched for configuration:

* {{Path|$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml}}
* {{Path|$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.yml}}
* {{Path|$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml}}
* {{Path|$HOME/.alacritty.yml}}

If no configuration is found then {{Path|$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml}} is created on the first run. On most systems this path defaults to: {{Path|$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml}}.

The default configuration file get installed into {{Path|/usr/share/doc/alacritty-<version>/}} directory.

{{Note|The configuration file is [[:wikipedia:YAML|YAML]] -formatted.
You '''need''' to preserve the indentation.}}

Many configuration options will take effect immediately upon saving the config file. Exception are the <code>font</code> and <code>dimensions</code> sections which requires Alacritty to be restarted.

For detailed explanation of the config file, please consult the comments in the default config file.

=== Choosing a font ===
Since alacritty is configured by editing a configure file by hand users can't just choose a font from a submenu. This might cause some problems since one needs to supply the exact font name for Alacritty.
To make things easier users of alacritty can run following command and just copy+paste the desired font name: {{Cmd|fc-list -f '%{family}\n' {{!}} awk '!x[$0]++'}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Font is too small or big ===

Status of this caveat can be tracked under: [https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/1501 Issue #1501].

=== Colors are weird ===
By default alacritty has not the font colors users would normally expect. Users need to configure Alacritty's color settings to the desired effect.
Here's a good starting point which some users may find sufficient:{{FileBox|filename={{Path|~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml}}|title=part of the config file|lang=ini|1=
# All the color setting are under the "color" section.
colors:

  # Normal colors
  normal:
    black:   '0x000000'
    red:     '0xBB2222'
    green:   '0x22BB22'
    yellow:  '0xBBBB22'
    blue:    '0x2222BB'
    magenta: '0xBB22BB'
    cyan:    '0x22BBBB'
    white:   '0xDDDDDD'

  # Bright colors
  bright:
    black:   '0x888888'
    red:     '0xFF2222'
    green:   '0x22FF22'
    yellow:  '0xFFFF22'
    blue:    '0x2222FF'
    magenta: '0xFF22FF'
    cyan:    '0x22FFFF'
    white:   '0xFFFFFF'}}
