Alacritty is focused on simplicity and performance. The performance goal means it should be faster than any other terminal emulator available. The simplicity goal means that it doesn't have features such as tabs or splits (which can be better provided by a window manager or terminal multiplexer) nor niceties like a GUI config editor.<sup>[1]</sup>

Alacritty is build on [https://github.com/rust-lang/rust Rust (programming language)] and is GPU accelerated.<sup>[2]</sup>

== USE fags ==

== Installation ==

== Configuration ==

There is a default `alacritty.yml` and `alacritty_macos.yml` at the git repository root for Linux and macOS respectively.

Alacritty looks for the configuration file at the following paths:

# <b>{{Path|$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml}}</b>
# <b>{{Path|$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.yml}}</b>
# <b>{{Path|$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml}}</b>
# <b>{{Path|$HOME/.alacritty.yml}}</b>

If none of these paths are found then <b>{{Path|$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml}}</b> is created once alacritty is first run. On most systems this often defaults to <b>{{Path|$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml}}</b>.

Many configuration options will take effect immediately upon saving changes to the config file. The only exception is the `font` and `dimensions` sections which requires Alacritty to be restarted. For further explanation of the config file, please consult the comments in the default config file.

== Tips and tricks ==

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Font is too big ===

#  Changing `font` variable in `font` does not affect alacritty if killed and invoked.
# Changing `background` in colors, primary does affect alacritty in real-time == Possible bug with text size?
