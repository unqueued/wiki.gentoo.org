LightDM is a cross-desktop display manager whose aim is to be the standard display manager for the X.org X server. The key features ( as listed by upstream ) are:
* A well-defined greeter API allowing multiple GUIs
* Support for all display manager use cases, with plugins where appropriate
* Low code complexity
* Fast performance
* No dependencies on Gnome libraries

== Installation ==
LightDM is available on Gentoo Linux and supports the following USE flags:
{{USEflag
|branding
|gtk+yes
|qt4
|introspection+yes
}}

You can install lightdm using the following command:
{{Emerge|x11-misc/lightdm}}

== Configuration ==
Configuration files of interest are:
* /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
* /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf (when gtk useflag is enabled)
* /etc/lightdm/lightdm-qt-greeter.conf (when qt4 useflag is enabled)


To have lightdm start at boot set the '''DISPLAYMANAGER''' in /etc/conf.d/xdm to ''lightdm'', as examlped below:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm|Set xdm to start lightdm|<pre>
...
DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"
</pre>}}
Finally add xdm to default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm}}
