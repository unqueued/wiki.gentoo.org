'''LightDM''' is a cross-desktop [[display manager]] whose aim is to be the standard display manager for the X.org X server. The key features (as listed by upstream) are:
* A well-defined greeter API allowing multiple GUIs
* Support for all display manager use cases, with plugins where appropriate
* Low code complexity
* Fast performance

== Installation ==

=== Stable version ===
Install {{Package|x11-misc/lightdm}}:
{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/lightdm
|branding+yes
|gtk+yes
|introspection+yes
|qt4+yes
|test++no
}}
{{Emerge|lightdm}}

=== Testing version ===
Starting from version 1.1.3, LightDM does not build any greeter, so you need to install them separately. The following greeters are available:
* {{Package|x11-misc/lightdm-gtk-greeter}} - A GTK+ based greeter for [[GNOME]] or [[Xfce]]
* {{Package|x11-misc/lightdm-kde}} - A [[KDE]] greeter
* {{Package|razorqt-base/razorqt-lightdm-greeter}} - A [[Razor-qt]] greeter

Installing a greeter, e.g the GTK+ greeter, will also pull in LightDM itself. The USE flags of {{Package|x11-misc/lightdm}} are:
{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/lightdm
|introspection+yes
|qt4+yes
}}
{{Emerge|lightdm-gtk-greeter}}

== Configuration ==
The configuration file for LightDM itself is: {{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf}}

=== GTK+ ===
{{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf}}

=== KDE ===
{{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm-kde-greeter.conf}}

The LightDM KDE greeter also provides a KCM (KDE Control Module), which appears in the System Settings under ''System Administration'' → ''Login Screen (LightDM)''

Due to LightDM currently assuming GTK+ greeter as the default, in case you want to use the KDE greeter, you need to explicitly specify it in the {{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf}}:
{{File|/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf||<pre>
[SeatDefaults]
…
greeter-session=lightdm-kde-greeter
</pre>}}

=== RazorQt ===
The RazorQt greeter currently does not offer any configuration options.

=== Boot service ===
To have LightDM start at boot change your {{Path|/etc/conf.d/xdm}}:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"
</pre>}}

Finally, add xdm to default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}
