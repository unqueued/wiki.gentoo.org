== LightDM on Gentoo ==

LightDM is available on Gentoo Linux and supports the following useflags

* ''branding'' = Installs a Gentoo specific background and requires the '''gtk''' useflag
* ''gtk'' = Installs the gtk greeter
* ''qt4'' = Installs the Qt4 greeter
* ''introspection'' = Uses the ''dev-libs/gobject-introspection'' for introspection

You can install lightdm using the following command:
{{ShellRoot|emerge -av lightdm}}

The configuration files are located in

{{Code|Lightdm Configuration Files|<pre>
/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf (when gtk useflag is enabled)
/etc/lightdm/lightdm-qt-greeter.conf (when qt4 useflag is enabled)</pre>}}

=== Start Lightdm automatically on every boot ==
If you want lightdm to start automatically you need to install the ''x11-apps/xdm'' package and configure it like this

{{ShellRoot|emerge -av xdm}}

The open the configuration file
{{Code|Xdm Configuration File|<pre>/etc/conf.d/xdm</pre>}}
and edit the '''DISPLAYMANAGER''' variable to look like this
{{Code|Set the DISPLAYMANAGER variable|<pre>DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"</pre>}}

Then add xdm to default runlevel
{{ShellRoot|rc-update add xdm default}}
