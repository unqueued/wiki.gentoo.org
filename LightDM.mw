LightDM is a cross-desktop display manager that aims is to be the standard display manager for the X.org X server. The key features ( as listed by upstream ) are:

* A well-defined greeter API allowing multiple GUIs
* Support for all display manager use cases, with plugins where appropriate
* Low code complexity
* Fast performance

== LightDM on Gentoo ==

LightDM is available on Gentoo Linux and supports the following useflags

* ''branding'' = Installs a Gentoo specific background and requires the '''gtk''' useflag
* ''gtk'' = Installs the gtk greeter
* ''qt4'' = Installs the Qt4 greeter
* ''introspection'' = Uses the ''dev-libs/gobject-introspection'' for introspection

You can install lightdm using the following command:
{{RootCmd|emerge -av lightdm}}

The configuration files are located in

{{Code|Lightdm Configuration Files|<pre>
/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf (when gtk useflag is enabled)
/etc/lightdm/lightdm-qt-greeter.conf (when qt4 useflag is enabled)</pre>}}

=== Start Lightdm automatically on every boot ===
Open the xdm configuration file
{{Code|Xdm Configuration File|<pre>/etc/conf.d/xdm</pre>}}
and edit the '''DISPLAYMANAGER''' variable to look like this
{{Code|Set the DISPLAYMANAGER variable|<pre>DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"</pre>}}

Then add xdm to default runlevel
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm}}
