[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech_G19 The Logitech G19] keyboard is a gaming keyboard that has extra keys and a built-in LCD color display. Its display is small and its resolution is rather low (320x240 pixels), but it's enough to do a lot of useful and cool things, considering it's connected with USB 2.0.
