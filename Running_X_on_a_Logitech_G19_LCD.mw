[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech_G19 The Logitech G19] keyboard is a gaming keyboard that has extra keys and a built-in LCD color display. Its display is small and its resolution is rather low (320x240 pixels), but it's enough to do a lot of useful and cool things, considering it's connected with USB 2.0.

For example, you can start/stop/restart the G19 X while your main X is running.

== Kernel Preparation ==

{{git clone https://github.com/CMoH/lg4l.git}}

{{$ grep CONFIG_FB_DEFERRED_IO /usr/src/linux/.config
CONFIG_FB_DEFERRED_IO=y}}

There isn't a way to directly set this from the kernel makemenu, but I did manage to enable it by enabling something that selects it:

{{Kernel|<pre> Device Drivers --->  
    HID Devices (HID_SUPPORT [=y]) --->  
       Special HID drivers --->
          <M> PicoLCD (graphic version)</pre>}}
