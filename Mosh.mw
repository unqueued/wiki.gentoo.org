'''Mosh''' is a SSH client server that is aware of connectivity problems of the original SSH implementation. Mosh can migrate physical connections and IP addresses while staying connected. Mosh depends on [[SSH]].

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-misc/mosh}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|net-misc/mosh}}:

{{Emerge|net-misc/mosh}}

== Configuration ==

Mosh requires [[UTF-8]] [[Localization/Guide#Locale_system|locales]] to be set in order to run. To check, run:

{{Cmd|locale -a}}

In case it does not return the [[UTF-8]] locale see [[UTF-8#Setting up UTF-8 with Gentoo Linux]].

Once the remote host has SSH running, mosh installed, and the UFT8 locale set connection is possible:

{{Cmd|mosh user@remote-host.com}}
