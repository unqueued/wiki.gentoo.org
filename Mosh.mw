'''Mosh''' is a SSH client server that is aware of connectivity problems of the original SSH implementation. Mosh can migrate physical connections and IP addresses while staying connected. Mosh depends on [[SSH]].

{{USEflag|package=net-misc/mosh}}

{{Emerge|net-misc/mosh}}

== Configuration ==

Mosh requires UTF8 locales to be set in order to run:

{{RootCmd
|echo "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen
