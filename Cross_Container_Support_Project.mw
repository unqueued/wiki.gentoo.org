==Running Qemu-user on Chroot==

This section updates the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/embedded/handbook/index.xml?part=1&chap=5 qemu-user] and describes how to build a chroot with qemu-user on x86 machine.

===Host Configuration===

In order to take advantage of qemu-user mode we need to do a few things. First we need to merge the main package we are going to need. Note the use of the static use flag.
Python is needed during qemu-user compiling.

{{RootCmd|echo "{{=}}app-emulation/qemu-user-1.0 ~x86" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
|eselect python set python2.7
|USE{{=}}"static" emerge -b1 app-emulation/qemu-user
}}




===Enter/Exit the Chroot===
