This article describes the removal and clean up of [[KDE]].

== 도입부 ==

It is recommended to begin with a clean environment in order to minimize issues, especially when considering one of the following actions:

* Downgrading KDE (eg. from snapshots/live ebuilds to the Portage version).
* Fully upgrading from KDE 3 to KDE 4.
* Moving from an old [[overlay]] to a different one or to the official packages.

== KDE 설치 취소 및 제거 ==

=== KDE에 원격으로 의존하는 모든 꾸러미 설치 취소 ===

A possible way to completely remove an old KDE installation is by explicitly uninstalling all kde-base packages and software depending on {{Package|kde-base/kdelibs}}:

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|kde-base/kdelibs $(qlist -IC 'kde-base/*') $(for name in $(qlist -IC {{!}} grep -v '^kde-base/') ; do ( qdepends -C $name {{!}} grep -q kdelibs ) && echo $name ; done)}}

Note that this will not just remove KDE but also all other packages depending on it (unconditionally or through a USE flag dependency), such as e.g. libreoffice[kde].

=== KDE 오버레이에서 제공한 KDE 꾸러미 설치 취소 ===

Removing KDE is also possible through sets (as provided by the [[KDE/Overlay|kde overlay]]):

{{Emerge|params+=-C|@kde-4.X @kdebase-4.X @kde-3.5}}

=== 오버레이 선택 취소 ===

If any old overlays are still defined, deselect them so that there are no conflicts with the KDE ebuilds.

=== 포티지 정의 정리 ===

Look in {{Path|/etc/portage}} for any KDE specific settings in {{Path|package.mask}}, {{Path|package.unmask}}, {{Path|package.keywords}} and {{Path|package.accept_keywords}}. Clean up those definitions pertaining to KDE packages.

=== 불필요한 의존성 제거 ===

After uninstalling KDE packages, ask Portage to uninstall any now unneeded dependencies:

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|&nbsp;}}

== 남아있는 KDE 정리 ==

If the system uses the ''desktop/kde'' [[Profile (Portage)|profile]], change to the ''desktop'' profile. Also check in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} and other configurations files what the active USE flags are.

Remove the remaining KDE configuration files and app data in the following folders:

* {{Path|~/.kde}} - Configuration files and app data of KDE 3.
* {{Path|~/.kde4}} - Configuration files and app data of KDE 4.
* {{Path|/usr/kde/}} - App data of KDE 3.
* {{Path|/var/lib/kde}} - Configuration files of KDE 4.
* {{Path|/var/lib/kdm}} - Configuration files of KDM.
* {{Path|/var/log/kdm.log}} - KDM log file.

The following folders are shared folders. Only remove the KDE related files:

* {{Path|~/.config}} - Configuration files of KDE apps.
* {{Path|~/.local}} - App data of KDE apps.
* {{Path|/etc/conf.d/xdm}} - XDM configuration file.
