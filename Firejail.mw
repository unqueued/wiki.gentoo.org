'''Firejail''' ({{Package|sys-apps/firejail}}, {{Package|sys-apps/firejail-lts}}) is a SUID '''sandboxing program''' that reduces the risk of security breaches by restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using, ''inter alia'', [[Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide/Sandboxing_the_Firefox_Browser_with_Firejail#Resource_Isolation_via_Linux_Namespaces|Linux namespaces]] and [[Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide/Sandboxing_the_Firefox_Browser_with_Firejail#Permitted_Syscall_Management_via_Seccomp-BPF|seccomp-bpf]]. The software includes security profiles for a large number of Linux programs: Mozilla Firefox, Chromium, VLC, Transmission etc.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/firejail}}

The <code>x11</code> USE flag sandbox replaces the regular X11 server with Xpra or Xephyr server. This prevents X11 keyboard loggers and screenshot utilities from [[Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide/Sandboxing_the_Firefox_Browser_with_Firejail#Demonstrating_the_X11_Vulnerability|accessing the main X11 server]] but introduces a lot of additional dependencies. 

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|sys-apps/firejail}}

Alternatively {{Package|sys-apps/firejail-lts}} can be used.

== Configuration ==

Firejail comes with numerous default profiles for many popular applications located in {{Path|/etc/firejail/}}.  In many cases the default profile configuration is sufficient. In addition to configuring a profile users may wish to set up a shortcut to enable firejail to be run by default for their selected application.

=== Profiles ===

The list of preconfigured profiles is available in {{Path|/etc/firejail/}}.

If you wish to make customizations for an existing profile simply copy it to your home directory and edit as necessary:
{{Cmd|cp /etc/firejail/firefox.profile ~/.config/firejail/firefox.profile}}

To make a profile for an application without a preconfigured profile you can use the default profile as a basis:
{{Cmd|cp /etc/firejail/default.profile ~/.config/firejail/''app-name''.profile}}

Here are some example options you may wish to include in a custom profile:

{{FileBox|title=Custom profile example|filename=~/.config/firejail/''app-name''.config|lang=ini|1=
whitelist ~/pictures/

whitelist ~/share/
read-only ~/share/

whitelist ~/dev/WebExtensions/
read-only ~/dev/WebExtensions/

whitelist ~/.cache/fish/

blacklist /mnt
blacklist /opt
}}

=== Using Firejail by default ===

A  symbolic  link to {{Path|/usr/bin/firejail}} under the name of a program, will start the program in Firejail sandbox.  A good place is {{Path|/usr/local/bin directory}}. For example to run Firefox with firejail by default:

{{RootCmd|ln -s /usr/bin/firejail /usr/local/bin/firefox}}

This works for clicking on desktop environment icons, menus etc. Use {{c|firejail --tree}} to verify the program is sandboxed.

{{Cmd|firejail --tree|output=<pre>
23615:gentoouser:firejail /usr/bin/firefox 
  23616:gentoouser:firejail /usr/bin/firefox 
    23618:gentoouser:/usr/bin/firefox
</pre>}}

Alternatively you can create the following file instead and make it executable:

{{FileBox|title=Firejail Desktop Integration|filename=/usr/local/bin/firefox|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/bash
firejail /usr/bin/firefox $@ 
}} 

This method allows command line options to be passed to firejail. Remember to make it executable with {{c|chmod +x /usr/local/bin/firefox}}.

=== System-wide Configuration ===

System-wide configuration is set in {{Path|/etc/firejail/firejail.config}}. If you have executables in {{Path|/usr/local/bin}} corresponding to one of your firejailed applications combined with the <code>private-bin</code> profile option then make sure <code>private-bin-no-local</code> is set to <code>yes</code>

{{FileBox|title=System-wide settings example|filename=/etc/firejail/firejail.config|lang=ini|1=
# Remove /usr/local directories from private-bin list, default disabled.
private-bin-no-local yes
}}

=== Kernel ===

Optionally you can enable user namespaces in the kernel so they can be utilized by firejail:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling user namespaces|1=
General setup --->
  Namespaces support --->
    <*>  User namespace
}}

== Usage ==

Usage is simple as:

{{Cmd|firejail firefox}}

Private mode can be used as a quick way of hiding all the files in your home directory from sandboxed programs. It is enabled using <code>--private</code> command line option:

{{Cmd|firejail --private firefox}}

Additionally, {{c|firejail}} can provide full graphical isolation for X11-based programs like {{c|firefox}}; an in-depth tutorial for doing so may be read [[Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide/Sandboxing_the_Firefox_Browser_with_Firejail|here]].

== Troubleshooting ==

=== firemon ===

firejail comes with a tool '''firemon''' which can be used to help with troubleshooting. To use it run {{c|firemon}} as root then in a separate terminal start the application you wish to troubleshoot with {{c|firejail ''application''}}.

=== not all executables from --private-bin list were found. ===

Either disable the <code>private-bin</code> option in your application profile or ensure <code>private-bin-no-local yes</code> is set in {{Path|/etc/firejail/firejail.config}}.

=== user namespaces not available in the current kernel. ===

Make sure user namespaces are set in the kernel. <code>CONFIG_USER_NS=y</code>
