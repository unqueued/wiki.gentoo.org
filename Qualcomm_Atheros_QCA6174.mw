The [[wikipedia:Qualcomm Atheros|Qualcomm Atheros]] QCA6174 is a [[wikipedia:IEEE_802.11ac|802.11ac]] Wireless Network Adapter which is used in some laptops.

To make it work it needs the kernel driver and firmware.

== Hardware detection ==

With {{c|lspci}} the PCI based hardware can be searched through:

{{RootInvocation|lspci -k|output=<pre>
3a:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 32)
        Subsystem: Bigfoot Networks, Inc. QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter
        Kernel driver in use: ath10k_pci
        Kernel modules: ath10k_pci
</pre>}}

In case it does not display '''ath10k_pci''' it has to be set up in the kernel
{{:Wifi/IEEE 802.11/en}}

The Qualcomm Atheros Killer N1525 Wireless-AC requires Linux firmware files.

{{RootCmd|emerge sys-kernel/linux-firmware }}

At the time of writing, '''=sys-kernel/linux-firmware-20161205''' doesn't seem to work with the Atheros wireless card.
One manual step is still required to update to a working firmware.
First backup the previous one.
{{RootCmd|mv /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board.bin /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board.bin.bak}}

Then download the [https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/ath10k/firmware?s%5b%5d{{=}}qca6174 working one].
{{RootCmd|wget  https://github.com/FireWalkerX/ath10k-firmware/raw/master/QCA6174/hw3.0/board-2.bin -O /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board.bin}}

This is what you should end up having.
{{Cmd|sha256sum /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board.bin*|output=<pre>
94f69f28b8901bc7e655347decc26d4bb9cd8cd1ec5e60c44a9bdd9a4023017e  /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board.bin
1a8d225818b46986fc4f615594fbe448fa820618590d6902c8f844bb37cda667  /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board.bin.bak
</pre>

Last step is to enable the ath10k module in the kernel configuration.
