== Overview ==
{{Important|This Page Has Been Tested Once and found to WFM.  It Might Still Drink All The Beer in Your Fridge ... or Worse}} 
=== History ===
Its been about a year since the Raspberry Pi3 with a 64bit capable CPU became available.  At the outset, it was difficult to install Gentoo on the Pi 3 in 64 bit mode.  A lot of work by a lot of people has almost brought a 64 bit Gentoo install on the Pi 3 down to almost a standard handbook install.

The Gentoo arm64 offering is experimental at the time of writing.  That means that very little is marked stable. Expect to use ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arm64" and then use package.accept_keywords too.

=== What Works ===
All the Pi 3 hardware is supported in 64 bit mode.  That's
 WiFi
 USB
 Ethernet (needs USB)
 Bluetooth
 Hardware Video Acceleration
 Sound over HDMI

=== Untested ===
 PAL/NTSC Video Output
 Analogue Sound Output

=== Whats Required ===
 Gentoo Install on a PC 
 microSD card reader for the PC
 Raspberry Pi 3
 microSD card > 8G
 USB Keyboard 
 USB Mouse
 HDMI Display 
The content of the microSD card will be wiped during the install.

== Installation Overview ==
* Install crossdev on the PC
* Fetch the Raspberry Pi firmware
* Fetch the Raspberry Pi kernel
* Partition the microSD card
* Fetch the Gentoo bits of the install
* Cross compile and install your kernel
* Setup
* Boot the Pi to Test
 
== Install Crossdev on the PC ==
There are no prebuilt kernel images for the Pi3 in its arm64 mode. Until you have a arm64 kernel, you can't boot it in 64 bit mode.
Its a little chicken and egg.  Once the Pi is running, it can build its own kernels.

crossdev is Gentoos' tool for building cross compiler tool chains.  Once its installed, we will use it to build the arm64 kernel on the Gentoo PC.
{{Emerge|crossdev}}will install the crossdev tool.

=== Using Crossdev to Build A Cross Compiler ===
{{RootCmd|crossdev -t aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu}}

You may need to nominate an overlay to store the cross ebuilds, crossdev will let you know. 

There are other parameters you can pass to crossdev too. 
{{Important|Do not use -S to build a stable toolchain, arm64 moves quickly}}

{{Important|Crossdev insists that many of the files in /etc/portage/ are directories}}
Convert files as crossdev asks e.g. 
 error: please convert /etc/portage/package.env to a directory
by appending _file to the existing filename
{{RootCmd|mv /etc/portage/package.env /etc/portage/package.env_file}}
making the directory
{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/portage/package.env}}
then moving  package.env_file into the directory.
{{RootCmd|mv /etc/portage/package.env_file /etc/portage/package.env}}

Rinse and repeat until crossdev is happy.

crossdev will take a while. Its building
 binutils:              binutils-[latest]
 gcc:                   gcc-[latest]
 headers:               linux-headers-[latest]
 libc:                  glibc-[latest]

When crossdev completes you will have a cross toolchain

{{Cmd|$ gcc-config -l
 [1] aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-5.4.0 *

 [2] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-5.3.0
 [3] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-5.4.0 *
}}

It will also create an arm64 target root in '''/usr/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/''' This is used by cross emerge. 

Pure cross compiling, other than the kernel, is out of scope of this guide.

== Fetch the Raspberry Pi Firmware ==
The Raspberry Pi Firmware is maintained in a git repository.  You will need to install git if you don't have it.
{{RootCmd|emerge -av git}}

Don't do anything you don't need to do as root. 

As your normal user, make some space in the home directory for raspberry pi
{{cmd|mkdir raspberrypi}} will do nicely. 

This will be for the Raspberry Pi Firmware and kernel

{{Cmd|cd raspberrypi}}
{{cmd|git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware}}

will fetch the Pi firmware into a directory called '''firmware'''

It will actually fetch all the history too.  If you are short of space or bandwidth, a shallow clone is all that's needed.
{{Important|Receiving objects: 100% (484760/484760), 6.32 GiB | 6.34 MiB/s, done}} 
A full clone is 6.3G and growing, we only need the /boot directory out of the master branch.

There is nothing to build.  ~/raspberrypi/firmware/boot is used as is.

== Fetch, Configure and Build the Raspberry Pi Kernel ==

=== Fetch the Raspberry Pi Kernel ===

Stay in raspberrypi and 

{{Cmd|git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux}}

will fetch the kernel into a directory called '''linux'''.

With absolutely no fanfare at all, 64 bit support was added to this kernel tree late in 2016.  No more searching for odd patches.

Not everything has been accepted by the mainline kernel yet but its getting closer.  Feel free to test for yourself.

The master branch may be broken as its commit by commit as it happens.  Test if you want to.  Its better to use an identified tag. At the time of writing that is rpi-4.10.y. The 4.10 mainline kernel is still at -rc status.
{{Cmd|cd linux}}
{{Cmd|git checkout rpi-4.10.y
Checking out files: 100% (33079/33079), done.

Branch rpi-4.10.y set up to track remote branch rpi-4.10.y from origin.

Switched to a new branch 'rpi-4.10.y'
}}

That's the kernel source tree in place, ready for configuring and cross compiling.

=== Configure The Kernel ===

{{Important|ARCH{{=}}arm64 must be specified everywhere or the kernel build system will use the HOST arch. This will destroy the arm64 .config file}}

As your user {{cmd|cd raspberrypi/linux}}

The bcmrpi3_defconfig is almost right as it stands.  It defaults to the powersave CPU governor, which runs the Pi at 600MHz.
All the governors are there. Ondemand is recommended.    
{{Cmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make bcmrpi3_defconfig}}
Either use menuconfig to change the default CPU governor, add something to the kernel command line, or change it after booting.
{{Cmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make menuconfig}}

Search for CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV go to that location and set the default to Ondemand. Exit menuconfig, saving the change.

 </nowiki>

The kernel .config contains lots of support for hardware you don't have and possibly 
have never heard of. More confident readers may be tempted to trim things out now.  
A word of advice - '''don't''', at least, not until the system boots.

=== Cross Compiling The Kernel ===


The kernel will not link with the gold linker. It ends with
 aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-ld: fatal error: -shared and -pie are incompatible
If you don't know what the gold linker is, you are not using it.

The build is conventional, other than telling the build system to build for arm64 and use the cross compiler.
{{Cmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make -jX}}
Change X to the number of parallel MAKE jobs you want to run.  Convention is cores+1.

== Partition the microSD card ==
{{Warning|This Step Will Destroy ALL The Data on the Card}}

=== Background ===
The Pi does not need a boot loader. There is no firmware for the arm CPU, like there is in a PC. Instead, the GPU manages loading software for the CPU to execute, while the CPU is held reset. Its the GPU that has the 'BIOS' that gets everything started.

This makes it impossible to brick the Pi, since at worst, the microSD card needs to be reloaded. 

This arrangement does impose some constraints on the microSD card.
 The partition table must be MSDOS
 The first partition (/boot) must be vfat.

The bootcode.bin file has some useful defaults that make setup easier, which we will take advantage of later.

=== Partitioning ===

Depending on how the microSD card is connected to you PC, it my be /dev/sdX or /dev/mmcblkY
{{Warning|Check! Do Get It Right - Don't Ruin your PC Install}}
In the example below, its /dev/sdk.
 
Using the partitioning tool of your choice, make three partitions on your microSD card.
 boot 128Mb
 swap 2G
 root (/) the rest.

Using fdisk, and your microSD card block device, not my /dev/sdk
{{rootCmd|fdisk /dev/...}}

==== Make The Partition Table and Add Partitions ====

Make a new MSDOS disklable
 Command (m for help): o

Add a new partition - this will be 128Mb for /boot
 <nowiki>

Add a 2G partition 2 for swap. 

Put the remaining space in partition 3 for root.
 
Check with 
 Command (m for help): p
Using an 8G microSD card it should show
 <nowiki>

/dev/sdk3       4458496 15523839 11065344  5.3G 83 Linux
</nowiki>


==== Set Flags and Partition Types ====

Toggle the bootable flag on partition 1
 <nowiki>
Command (m for help): a
Partition number (1-3, default 3): 1
</nowiki>
The bootable flag on partition 1 is enabled now.

Mark partition 1 as FAT
 <nowiki>
Command (m for help): t
Partition number (1-3, default 3): 1
Partition type (type L to list all types): c

</nowiki>

{{Important|The Pi checks the type of partition 1 in the partition table and will not boot if its 82}}

Mark partition 2 as swap
 <nowiki>
Command (m for help): t
Partition number (1-3, default 3): 2
Partition type (type L to list all types): 82

Changed type of partition 'Linux swap / Solaris' to 'Linux swap / Solaris'.
</nowiki>

Check again.
 <nowiki>
Device     Boot   Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type

/dev/sdk3       4458496 15523839 11065344  5.3G 83 Linux
</nowiki>


==== Save The New Partiton Table ====

{{Warning|Nothing has been written to the microSD card yet. This is the last opportunity to back out}}
Exit fdisk with either w or q
   w   write table to disk and exit
   q   quit without saving changes

=== Make Filesystems ===

You know the block devices from the partitioning step above. Fill in the ... to match your system.

vfat for /boot
{{rootCmd|mkfs -t vfat -F 32 /dev/...1}}
{{Important| Be sure to add the -F 32 switch. When using mkfs to make a vfat file system and -F 32 is not explicitly defined, mkdosfs will automatically select between 12, 16 and 32 bit, whatever mkdosfs thinks will fit better for the file system size, which in this case it would default to FAT16. This partition MUST be formatted FAT32 in order for the Raspberry Pi to boot.}}

mkswap for swap
{{rootCmd|mkswap /dev/...2}}

ext4 for root
{{rootCmd|mkfs -i 8192 -t ext4 /dev/...3 }}

{{Important|-i 8192 makes an i-node for every two filesystem blocks, 8kB}}
The i-node count cannot be changed after filesystem creation and can limit the number of files on a files system.
The Gentoo repository alone needs over 17,000 i-nodes.

== Fetch the Gentoo bits of the install ==
To make it easy to cross refer to the [[Gentoo_Handbook]]
{{RootCmd|mkdir /mnt/gentoo}}

Mount the microSD card root filesystem at /mnt/gentoo
{{RootCmd|mount /dev/xxx3 /mnt/gentoo}}

=== Install the arm64 Stage 3 ===
Following the [[Gentoo_Handbook]] fetch the [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/experimental/arm64/ arm64 stage3]
and untar it to /mnt/gentoo in the normal way.

/mnt/gentoo/tmp should be empty. Clear it now or the the Pi will do it at boot.
That may take a long time.
{{rootCmd|rm -rf /mnt/gentoo/tmp/*}}

Before and after clearing /mnt/gentoo/tmp
 Filesystem                1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
 /dev/sdk3                   5380212   1205968   3881228  24% /mnt/gentoo
 /dev/sdk3                   5380212    874636   4212560  18% /mnt/gentoo

=== Install a Portage Snapshot ===
''This step is not actually needed to boot the Pi but emerge won't work without it''

Following the [[Gentoo_Handbook]] fetch and unpack a
[http://distfiles.gentoo.org/snapshots/portage-latest.tar.bz2 portage shapshot] in the normal way. 

Careful readers can copy their host /usr/portage as long as ./packages and ./distfiles are omitted.

== Populating /boot ==
=== The Raspberry Pi Foundation Provided Files ===
Mount the microSD card boot at /mnt/gentoo/boot. (The microSD card root should still be mounted at /mnt/gentoo)
{{RootCmd|mount /dev/xxx1  /mnt/gentoo/boot}}

As root, copy the content of your normal users ~/raspberrypi/firmware/boot to /mnt/gentoo/boot.
{{RootCmd|cp -a /home/<user>/raspberrypi/firmware/boot/* /mnt/gentoo/boot}}

This will generate a warning
 cp: failed to preserve ownership for '<filename>': Operation not permitted
for every file.  vfat does not support permissions, so the warning are expected and can be ignored.

You should end up with files in /mnt/gentoo/boot, not a directory called boot.

Not all the files there are required. Its a one size fits all for all models of Raspberry Pi operating in 32 bit mode.

=== Install the Kernel to the microSD Card ===

The kernel was built above, now to install it.  

The kernel is in three parts
 kernel binary
 kernel modules
 the device tree 

==== Install The Kernel Binary ====
As root, copy the kernel binary from the build location 
{{RootCmd|cp /home/<user>/raspberrypi/linux/arch/arm64/boot/Image /mnt/gentoo/boot/kernel8.img}}

{{Important|If the file /boot/kernel8.img exists the bootcode.bin sets up the Pi for 64 bit operation and loads /boot/kernel8.img as the kernel}}

It is possible to use other kernel file names by adding entries to /boot/config.txt

==== Install The Device Tree ====
The device tree binary (.dtb) describes the hardware to the kernel. This avoids having all the existing hardware configurations ard coded into the kernel.

Due to the way the Raspberry Pi 64 bit kernel support has been added, there are going to be two different device trees with the same file name. A 32 bit version and a 64 bit version. They are not interchangeable. Move the 32 bit version out of the way.
{{RootCmd|mv /mnt/gentoo/boot/bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb /mnt/gentoo/boot/bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb_32}} That's renamed the 32 bit version. 

Copy the dtb from the build location
{{RootCmd|cp /home/<user>/raspberrypi/linux/arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb /mnt/gentoo/boot}}

It is possible to use other device tree file names by adding entries to /boot/config.txt

==== Install The Kernel Modules ====
From the top of the kernel tree, install the kernel modules.
{{RootCmd|cd /home/<user>/raspberrypi/linux}}
{{RootCmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH{{=}}/mnt/gentoo}}

The INSTALL_MOD_PATH is the root of the filesystem the modules are to be installed into. Due to kernel naming  
{{Cmd|uname -a

Linux Pi3 64bit 4.10.0-rc6-v8+ #2 SMP PREEMPT Thu Feb 2 20:34:34 GMT 2017 aarch64 GNU/Linux 
}} its unlikely you will have a 4.10.0-rc6-v8+ so omitting INSTALL_MOD_PATH is probably harmless to your build host install.

==== Checking The Kernel Install ====

{{RootCmd|ls /mnt/gentoo/boot}}
 COPYING.linux           bcm2708-rpi-cm.dtb      bcm2710-rpi-cm3.dtb  fixup_db.dat  kernel8.img   start_db.elf
 LICENCE.broadcom        bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb     bootcode.bin         fixup_x.dat   overlays      start_x.elf
 bcm2708-rpi-b-plus.dtb  bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb     fixup.dat            kernel.img    start.elf
 bcm2708-rpi-b.dtb       bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb_32  fixup_cd.dat         kernel7.img   start_cd.elf

Notice the two bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb device tree binaries and the kernel8.img.

{{RootCmd|ls /mnt/gentoo/lib/modules}}
 4.10.0-rc6-v8+
Shows that the kernel modules were installed to the correct location.

== Fetching and Installing Firmware ==
=== Install WiFi Firmware ===

The on board wifi needs firmware.
The files '''brcmfmac43430-sdio.txt''' and '''brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin''' are both required to be present in '''/mnt/gentoo/lib/firmware/brcm/'''

They can be downloaded via [https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/brcm80211 wireless.wiki.kernel.org]

=== Install Bluetooth Firmware ===
The on board bluetooth needs the firmware files '''bcm43xx-0.fw''' and '''bcm43xx_hdr-0.fw''' in '''/mnt/gentoo/lib/firmware'''.

It also needs a startup script in '''/mnt/gentoo/etc/local.d/bluetooth.start'''

 #!/bin/bash
 # Bluetooth is attached to /dev/ttyAMA0 so attach it and 
 # load the firmware 
 /usr/bin/hciattach /dev/ttyAMA0 bcm43xx 921600 noflow -

== Setup ==
Much of the setup prior to booting a new Gentoo install is done in a chroot.
Chrooting into an arm64 install from some other arch is beyond the scope of this guide. Instead, only the bare minimum setup, from outside the chroot is covered.
 
=== Root Password ===
{{Important|You need this to be able to log in at all}}

There are several ways to generate a password hash for /etc/shadow
I usually copy the hash from another system.
My Pi uses an /etc/shadow root entry  
 root:$6$xxPVR/Td5iP$/7Asdgq0ux2sgNkklnndcG4g3493kUYfrrdenBXjxBxEsoLneJpDAwOyX/kkpFB4pU5dlhHEyN0SK4eh/WpmO0::0:99999:7:::
The matching password is raspberry.

Feel free to use that line to replace the root entry in '''/mnt/gentoo/etc/shadow'''

You can change the password once you are logged in.

=== /etc/fstab ===
On the Pi, the microSD card will be /dev/mmcblk0 with partitions /dev/mmcblk0p1, /dev/mmcblk0p2 and /dev/mmcblk0p3

Edit /mnt/gentoo/etc/fstab to match.
{{RootCmd|nano -w  /mnt/gentoo/etc/fstab}}

 /dev/mmcblk0p1          /boot           vfat            noauto,noatime  1 2
 /dev/mmcblk0p2          none            swap            sw              0 0
 /dev/mmcblk0p3          /               ext4            noatime         0 1

=== /boot/config.txt ===

This file will not exist until its created. Create it with the following content.
{{RootCmd|nano -w /mnt/gentoo/boot/config.txt

=== Alternative: Use the /boot/config.txt From A Working Raspian Install ===

Here is a config.txt file from a working Raspian install. If the above does not work, this one should.

=== /boot/cmdline.txt ===
This file will not exist until its created. Create it with the following content.
{{RootCmd|nano -w /mnt/gentoo/boot/cmdline.txt
root{{=}}/dev/mmcblk0p3 rootfstype{{=}}ext4 rootwait

This boots the Pi with a kernel command line of
 <nowiki>

</nowiki>

It really is one long line.

=== Setting the Console Keymap === 
This step is optional if you can log in using the default 
 keymap="us"
{{RootCmd|nano -w /mnt/gentoo/etc/conf.d/keymaps}}

Set the keymap to something you use, e.g.
 keymap="dvorak-uk"

== Boot the Pi to Test ==
Unmount the microSD card.
{{RootCmd|umount /mnt/gentoo/boot}}
{{RootCmd|umount /mnt/gentoo/}}

When the prompt returns, move the microSD card to the Raspberry Pi and power on.

For 10 seconds (it seems much longer) you should see the GPU 'Rainbow' test pattern, then the familiar boot messages.

Log in at the Pi console. Nothing was added to any runlevels during the install, so networking was not started, nor anything that depends on networking, like ntpd and sshd.

The Pi does not have a hardware real time clock. Its time will be Jan 1, 1970.

== What Next ==

As always with Gentoo, if it booted, that's the hard bit done.

 All The setup steps in the Gentoo Handbook
 Fix the MAC address or use a static IP
 Allow root logins via ssh 
 Add a crond, a logger and other things the handbook does before the reboot. 
 Add Kernel Sources (or at least the .config)

=== Random Hints ===
==== WiFi and Bluetooth ====

Its unlikely that WiFi or Bluetooth will work at first boot. Expect to add
some control tools for both.


==== CFLAGS ====

 CFLAGS="-march=armv8-a+crc -mtune=cortex-a53 -ftree-vectorize -O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer"

gcc-6.x allows the use of -march=native but that will prevent the use of distcc. The above is
the same as gcc-6.3 would set for -march=native anyway.

==== ACCEPT_KEYWORDS ====

Outside of the @system set, arm64 is either testing or keyword masked. Set 
 ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arm64"
and expect to use package.accept_keywords too.

{{Warning|The stage 3 tarball has been built with gcc-4.9 as gcc-5.4 is in testing ...}}
Upgrade gcc then rebuild all of the installed C++ software.  
{{Important|News item 2015-10-22  GCC 5 Defaults to the New C++11 ABI}}

==== MAKEOPTS ====

With only 1G RAM, and four cores, the conventional
 MAKEOPTS="-j5"
is a bit aggressive for building larger things. It will force swapping or even 
appear to lock up the Pi completely, to the point where it won't even respond to 
the console.

Use files in '''/etc/portage/env/''' and entries in '''/etc/portage/package.env'''
to set MAKEOPTS on a per package basis.

==== Networking ====

dhcpcd is not in the stage 3, nor is eth0 in the default runlevel.
{{RootCmd|busybox udhcpc eth0}} will bring up eth0

==== sshd ====
The default configuration for sshd will not allow password based root logins.
 add your ssh public key for root
 make a normal user in the wheel group
 edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to allow password based root logins

On the [https://forums.gentoo.org/ Gentoo Forums], start a new topic in the Gentoo on Alternative Architectures forum.

I don't mind a PM on the forums with a link to your post. I don't do one to one help via email or the forums PM system.  
You will either get no response at all or a request to make a public post.  That way others may learn from your misfortune.
