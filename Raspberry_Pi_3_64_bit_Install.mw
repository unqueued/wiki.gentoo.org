{{Important|This Page Has Been Tested Twice and found to WFM. It Might Still Drink All The Beer in Your Fridge ... or Worse}}

== Overview ==
 
=== History ===

Its been about a year since the Raspberry Pi 3 with a 64-bit capable CPU became available. At the outset, it was difficult to install Gentoo on the Pi 3 in 64-bit mode. A lot of work by a lot of people has almost brought a 64-bit Gentoo install on the Pi 3 down to almost a standard handbook install.

The Gentoo {{Keyword|arm64}} offering is experimental at the time of writing. That means that very little is marked stable. Expect to use <code>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arm64"</code> and then use {{Path|package.accept_keywords}} too.

=== What works ===

All the Pi 3 hardware is supported in 64-bit mode.  That's
 WiFi
 USB
 Ethernet (needs USB)
 Bluetooth
 Hardware Video Acceleration
 Sound over HDMI

=== Untested ===

 PAL/NTSC Video Output
 Analogue Sound Output

=== Whats required ===

 Gentoo Install on a PC 
 microSD card reader for the PC
 Raspberry Pi 3
 microSD card > 8G
 USB Keyboard 
 USB Mouse
 HDMI Display 

The content of the microSD card will be wiped during the install.

== Installation overview ==

* Install crossdev on the PC
* Fetch the Raspberry Pi firmware
* Fetch the Raspberry Pi kernel
* Partition the microSD card
* Fetch the Gentoo bits of the install
* Cross compile and install your kernel
* Setup
* Boot the Pi to Test
 
== Install crossdev on the PC ==

There are no prebuilt kernel images for the Pi 3 in its arm64 mode. Until you have a {{Keyword|arm64}} kernel, you can't boot it in 64-bit mode.
Its a little chicken and egg. Once the Pi is running, it can build its own kernels.

crossdev is Gentoos' tool for building cross compiler tool chains. Once its installed, we will use it to build the {{Keyword|arm64}} kernel on the Gentoo PC.

{{Emerge|sys-devel/crossdev}}

will install the crossdev tool.

=== Using crossdev to build a cross compiler ===

{{RootCmd|crossdev -t aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu}}

You may need to nominate an overlay to store the cross ebuilds, crossdev will let you know. 

There are other parameters you can pass to crossdev too.

{{Important|Do not use <code>-S</code> to build a stable toolchain, {{Keyword|arm64}} moves quickly}}

{{Important|Crossdev insists that many of the files in {{Path|/etc/portage/}} are directories}}

Convert files as crossdev asks e.g.

 error: please convert /etc/portage/package.env to a directory

by appending _file to the existing filename

{{RootCmd|mv /etc/portage/package.env /etc/portage/package.env_file}}

making the directory

{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/portage/package.env}}

then moving {{Path|package.env_file}} into the directory.

{{RootCmd|mv /etc/portage/package.env_file /etc/portage/package.env}}

Rinse and repeat until crossdev is happy.

crossdev will take a while. It's building

 binutils:              binutils-[latest]
 gcc:                   gcc-[latest]
 headers:               linux-headers-[latest]
 libc:                  glibc-[latest]

When crossdev completes you will have a cross toolchain

{{Cmd
|gcc-config -l
|output=<pre>
[1] aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-5.4.0 *
[2] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-5.3.0
[3] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-5.4.0 *
</pre>}}

It will also create an {{Keyword|arm64}} target root in {{Path|/usr/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu}} This is used by cross emerge. 

Pure cross compiling, other than the kernel, is out of scope of this guide.

== Fetch the Raspberry Pi firmware ==

The Raspberry Pi Firmware is maintained in a git repository. You will need to install git if you don't have it.

{{Emerge|dev-vcs/git}}

Don't do anything you don't need to do as root. 

As your normal user, make some space in the home directory for raspberry pi

{{Cmd|mkdir raspberrypi}}

will do nicely. 

This will be for the Raspberry Pi firmware and kernel

{{Cmd
|cd raspberrypi
|git clone <nowiki>https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware</nowiki>
}}

will fetch the Pi firmware into a directory called {{Path|firmware}}

It will actually fetch all the history too. If you are short of space or bandwidth, a shallow clone is all that's needed.

{{Important|Receiving objects: 100% (484760/484760), 6.32 GiB {{!}} 6.34 MiB/s, done}} 

A full clone is 6.3G and growing, we only need the {{Path|/boot}} directory out of the master branch.

There is nothing to build. {{Path|~/raspberrypi/firmware/boot}} is used as is.

== Fetch, configure and build the Raspberry Pi kernel ==

=== Fetch the Raspberry Pi kernel ===

Stay in {{Path|raspberrypi}} directory and 

{{Cmd|git clone <nowiki>https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux</nowiki>}}

will fetch the kernel into a directory called {{Path|linux}}.

With absolutely no fanfare at all, 64-bit support was added to this kernel tree late in 2016. No more searching for odd patches.

Not everything has been accepted by the mainline kernel yet but it's getting closer. Feel free to test for yourself.

The master branch may be broken as its commit by commit as it happens. Test if you want to. It's better to use an identified tag. At the time of writing that is rpi-4.10.y. The 4.10 mainline kernel is still at -rc status.

{{Cmd
|cd linux
|git checkout rpi-4.10.y
|output=<pre>
Checking out files: 100% (33079/33079), done.

Branch rpi-4.10.y set up to track remote branch rpi-4.10.y from origin.

Switched to a new branch 'rpi-4.10.y'
</pre>}}

That's the kernel source tree in place, ready for configuring and cross compiling.

=== Configure the kernel ===

{{Important|<code>ARCH{{=}}arm64</code> must be specified everywhere or the kernel build system will use the host arch. This will destroy the arm64 {{Path|.config}} file}}

As your user

{{cmd|cd raspberrypi/linux}}

The {{Path|bcmrpi3_defconfig}} config file is almost right as it stands. It defaults to the powersave CPU governor, which runs the Pi at 600MHz.
All the governors are there. Ondemand is recommended.

{{Cmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make bcmrpi3_defconfig}}

Either use menuconfig to change the default CPU governor, add something to the kernel command line, or change it after booting.

{{Cmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make menuconfig}}

Search for <var>CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV</var> go to that location and set the default to Ondemand. Exit menuconfig, saving the change.

 </nowiki>

The kernel {{Path|.config}} contains lots of support for hardware you don't have and possibly 
have never heard of. More confident readers may be tempted to trim things out now.  
A word of advice - '''don't''', at least, not until the system boots.

=== Cross compiling the kernel ===

The kernel will not link with the gold linker. It ends with

 aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-ld: fatal error: -shared and -pie are incompatible

If you don't know what the gold linker is, you are not using it.

The build is conventional, other than telling the build system to build for arm64 and use the cross compiler.

{{Cmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make -jX}}

Change <code>X</code> to the number of parallel make jobs you want to run. Convention is cores+1.

== Partition the microSD card ==

{{Warning|This step will destroy ALL the data on the microSD card}}

=== Background ===

The Raspberry Pi does not need a boot loader. There is no firmware for the ARM CPU, like there is in a PC. Instead, the GPU manages loading software for the CPU to execute, while the CPU is held reset. Its the GPU that has the 'BIOS' that gets everything started.

This makes it impossible to brick the Pi, since at worst, the microSD card needs to be reloaded. 

This arrangement does impose some constraints on the microSD card.

 The partition table must be MSDOS
 The first partition (/boot) must be vfat.

The {{Path|bootcode.bin}} file has some useful defaults that make setup easier, which we will take advantage of later.

=== Partitioning ===

Depending on how the microSD card is connected to you PC, it my be {{Path|/dev/sdX}} or {{Path|/dev/mmcblkY}}

{{Warning|Check! Do get it right - Don't ruin your PC install}}

In the example below, it's {{Path|/dev/sdk}}.
 
Using the partitioning tool of your choice, make three partitions on your microSD card.

 boot 128Mb
 swap 2G
 root (/) the rest.

Using {{C|fdisk}}, and your microSD card block device, not my {{Path|/dev/sdk}}

{{rootCmd|fdisk /dev/...}}

==== Make the partition table and add partitions ====

Make a new MS-DOS disklable

 Command (m for help): o

Add a new partition - this will be 128Mb for {{Path|/boot}}

 <nowiki>
Command (m for help): n
Partition type
   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)

</nowiki>

Has created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 128 MiB.

Add a 2G partition 2 for swap.

Put the remaining space in partition 3 for root.
 
Check with

 Command (m for help): p

Using an 8G microSD card it should show

 <nowiki>
Device     Boot   Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type

/dev/sdk3       4458496 15523839 11065344  5.3G 83 Linux
</nowiki>

==== Set flags and partition types ====

Toggle the bootable flag on partition 1

 <nowiki>
Command (m for help): a
Partition number (1-3, default 3): 1
</nowiki>

The bootable flag on partition 1 is enabled now.

Mark partition 1 as FAT

 <nowiki>
Command (m for help): t
Partition number (1-3, default 3): 1
Partition type (type L to list all types): c

Changed type of partition 'Linux' to 'W95 FAT32 (LBA)'.

</nowiki>

{{Important|The Pi checks the type of partition 1 in the partition table and will not boot if its 82}}

Mark partition 2 as swap

 <nowiki>
Command (m for help): t
Partition number (1-3, default 3): 2
Partition type (type L to list all types): 82

Changed type of partition 'Linux swap / Solaris' to 'Linux swap / Solaris'.
</nowiki>

Check again.

 <nowiki>
Device     Boot   Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sdk1  *       2048   264191   262144  128M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)

==== Save the new partition table ====

{{Warning|Nothing has been written to the microSD card yet. This is the last opportunity to back out}}

Exit {{C|fdisk}} with either {{Key|w}} or {{Key|q}}

   w   write table to disk and exit
   q   quit without saving changes

=== Make filesystems ===

You know the block devices from the partitioning step above. Fill in the ... to match your system.

vfat for {{Path|/boot}}

{{rootCmd|mkfs -t vfat -F 32 /dev/...1}}

{{Important|Be sure to add the <code>-F 32</code> switch. When using {{C|mkfs}} to make a vfat file system and <code>-F 32</code> is not explicitly defined, {{C|mkdosfs}} will automatically select between 12, 16 and 32-bit, whatever {{C|mkdosfs}} thinks will fit better for the file system size, which in this case it would default to FAT16. This partition MUST be formatted FAT32 in order for the Raspberry Pi to boot.}}

{{C|mkswap}} for swap

{{rootCmd|mkswap /dev/...2}}

ext4 for root

{{rootCmd|mkfs -i 8192 -t ext4 /dev/...3 }}

{{Important|<code>-i 8192</code> makes an inode for every two filesystem blocks, 8kB}}

The inode count cannot be changed after filesystem creation and can limit the number of files on a files system.
The Gentoo repository alone needs over 17,000 inodes.

== Fetch the Gentoo bits of the install ==

To make it easy to cross refer to the [[Gentoo_Handbook]]

{{RootCmd|mkdir /mnt/gentoo}}

Mount the microSD card root filesystem at {{Path|/mnt/gentoo}}

{{RootCmd|mount /dev/xxx3 /mnt/gentoo}}

=== Install the arm64 stage 3 ===

Following the [[Gentoo_Handbook]] fetch the [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/experimental/arm64/ arm64 stage3]
and untar it to {{Path|/mnt/gentoo}} in the normal way.

{{Path|/mnt/gentoo/tmp}} should be empty. Clear it now or the the Pi will do it at boot.

That may take a long time.

{{rootCmd|rm -rf /mnt/gentoo/tmp/*}}

Before and after clearing {{Path|/mnt/gentoo/tmp}}

 Filesystem                1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
 /dev/sdk3                   5380212   1205968   3881228  24% /mnt/gentoo
 /dev/sdk3                   5380212    874636   4212560  18% /mnt/gentoo

=== Install a Portage snapshot ===

''This step is not actually needed to boot the Pi but {{C|emerge}} won't work without it''

Following the [[Gentoo_Handbook]] fetch and unpack a
[http://distfiles.gentoo.org/snapshots/portage-latest.tar.bz2 portage shapshot] in the normal way. 

Careful readers can copy their host {{Path|/usr/portage}} as long as {{Path|./packages}} and {{Path|./distfiles}} are omitted.

== Populating /boot ==

=== The Raspberry Pi Foundation provided files ===

Mount the microSD card boot at {{Path|/mnt/gentoo/boot}}. (The microSD card root should still be mounted at {{Path|/mnt/gentoo}})

{{RootCmd|mount /dev/xxx1 /mnt/gentoo/boot}}

As root, copy the content of your normal users {{Path|~/raspberrypi/firmware/boot}} to {{Path|/mnt/gentoo/boot}}.

{{RootCmd|cp -rv ~<user>/raspberrypi/firmware/boot/* /mnt/gentoo/boot}}

You should end up with files in {{Path|/mnt/gentoo/boot}}, not a directory called {{Path|boot}}.

Not all the files there are required. It's a one size fits all for all models of Raspberry Pi operating in 32-bit mode.

=== Install the kernel to the microSD card ===

The kernel was built above, now to install it.  

The kernel is in three parts

 kernel binary
 kernel modules
 the device tree 

==== Install the kernel binary ====

As root, copy the kernel binary from the build location 

{{RootCmd|cp /home/<user>/raspberrypi/linux/arch/arm64/boot/Image /mnt/gentoo/boot/kernel8.img}}

{{Important|If the {{Path|/boot/kernel8.img}} file exists, the {{Path|bootcode.bin}} sets up the Pi for 64-bit operation and loads {{Path|/boot/kernel8.img}} as the kernel.}}

It is possible to use other kernel file names by adding entries to {{Path|/boot/config.txt}}

==== Install the device tree ====

The device tree binary ({{Path|.dtb}}) describes the hardware to the kernel. This avoids having all the existing hardware configurations are coded into the kernel.

Due to the way the Raspberry Pi 64-bit kernel support has been added, there are going to be two different device trees with the same file name. A 32-bit version and a 64-bit version. They are not interchangeable. Move the 32-bit version out of the way.

{{RootCmd|mv /mnt/gentoo/boot/bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb /mnt/gentoo/boot/bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb_32}}

That's renamed the 32-bit version. 

Copy the dtb from the build location

{{RootCmd|cp /home/<user>/raspberrypi/linux/arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb /mnt/gentoo/boot}}

It is possible to use other device tree file names by adding entries to {{Path|/boot/config.txt}}

==== Install the kernel modules ====

From the top of the kernel tree, install the kernel modules.

{{RootCmd
|cd /home/<user>/raspberrypi/linux
|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH{{=}}/mnt/gentoo
}}

The <var>INSTALL_MOD_PATH</var> is the root of the filesystem the modules are to be installed into. Due to kernel naming

{{Cmd
|uname -a
|output=<pre>
Linux Pi3 64bit 4.10.0-rc6-v8+ #2 SMP PREEMPT Thu Feb 2 20:34:34 GMT 2017 aarch64 GNU/Linux
</pre>}}

it's unlikely you will have a 4.10.0-rc6-v8+ so omitting <var>INSTALL_MOD_PATH</var> is probably harmless to your build host install.

==== Checking the kernel install ====

{{RootCmd
|ls /mnt/gentoo/boot
|output=<pre>
COPYING.linux           bcm2708-rpi-cm.dtb      bcm2710-rpi-cm3.dtb  fixup_db.dat  kernel8.img   start_db.elf
LICENCE.broadcom        bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb     bootcode.bin         fixup_x.dat   overlays      start_x.elf
bcm2708-rpi-b-plus.dtb  bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb     fixup.dat            kernel.img    start.elf
bcm2708-rpi-b.dtb       bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb_32  fixup_cd.dat         kernel7.img   start_cd.elf
</pre>}}

Notice the two {{Path|bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb}} device tree binaries and the {{Path|kernel8.img}}.

{{RootCmd
|ls /mnt/gentoo/lib/modules
|output=<pre>
4.10.0-rc6-v8+
</pre>
}}

Shows that the kernel modules were installed to the correct location.

== Raspberry Pi 3 peripherals ==

Now that we have the base operating system in, we will need to do some file configuration by hand to get the peripherals working. 

=== Serial port configuration ===

The Gentoo stage 3 comes with the default Gentoo serial port configuration. In Raspbian Jessie, udev rules exist that provide aliases for GPIO14:15 ({{Path|/dev/serial0}}) and the Bluetooth serial port ({{Path|/dev/serial1}}). If you're not using the pi3-miniuart-bt or the pi3-disable-bt device tree overlays, {{Path|ttyS0}} (mini UART) points to {{Path|/dev/serial0}} (GPIO14:15) while {{Path|ttyAMA0}} (Bluetooth) points to {{Path|/dev/serial1}} (Bluetooth). 

If, however, the pi3-miniuart-bt overlay is in use, udev rules automagically make {{Path|ttyAMA0}} point to {{Path|/dev/serial0}} (GPIO14:15) while {{Path|ttyS0}} points to {{Path|/dev/serial1}} (Bluetooth). If the pi3-disable-bt overlay is in use, {{Path|ttyAMA0}} still points to {{Path|/dev/serial0}} (GPIO14:15) while Bluetooth/{{Path|ttyS0}} are disabled.

This allows the use of {{Path|/dev/serial1}} in any Bluetooth configuration files and command line arguments regardless of which serial port it is assigned to. It also allows the use of /{{Path|dev/serial0}} in any apps and/or configuration files/command line arguments which reference the GPIO14:15 pins regardless of which overlay is/is not in use.

In order to make things easier when working with the device tree overlays for the Bluetooth module as well as any applications which were written in a Raspbian environment that uses the {{Path|serial0}} and {{Path|serial1}} aliases, we'll need to first create a udev rule to mimic this behavior.

Open up {{Path|/etc/inittab}} -

{{RootCmd|nano -w /etc/inittab}}

Find this line and comment it out by appending a # at the beginning of the line -

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/inittab|1=
f0:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyAMA0 vt100
}}

Save and exit the file. This prevents Gentoo from assigning the serial console to {{Path|ttyAMA0}} on {{Path|/root}} mount, which will conflict with Bluetooth operation if left uncommented.

Next, create the empty file {{Path|99-com.rules}} in {{Path|/etc/udev/rules.d}} -

{{RootCmd|nano -w /etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules}}

Copy and paste this into the empty file, then save and exit the file -

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules|1=
SUBSYSTEM=="input", GROUP="input", MODE="0660"
SUBSYSTEM=="i2c-dev", GROUP="i2c", MODE="0660"
SUBSYSTEM=="spidev", GROUP="spi", MODE="0660"
SUBSYSTEM=="bcm2835-gpiomem", GROUP="gpio", MODE="0660"

SUBSYSTEM=="gpio*", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c '\
        chown -R root:gpio /sys/class/gpio && chmod -R 770 /sys/class/gpio;\
        chown -R root:gpio /sys/devices/virtual/gpio && chmod -R 770 /sys/devices/virtual/gpio;\
        chown -R root:gpio /sys$devpath && chmod -R 770 /sys$devpath\
'"

KERNEL=="ttyAMA[01]", GROUP="dialout", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c '\
        ALIASES=/proc/device-tree/aliases; \
        if cmp -s $ALIASES/uart0 $ALIASES/serial0; then \
                echo 0;\
        elif cmp -s $ALIASES/uart0 $ALIASES/serial1; then \
                echo 1; \
        else \
                exit 1; \
        fi\
'", SYMLINK+="serial%c"

KERNEL=="ttyS0", GROUP="dialout", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c '\
        ALIASES=/proc/device-tree/aliases; \
        if cmp -s $ALIASES/uart1 $ALIASES/serial0; then \
                echo 0; \
        elif cmp -s $ALIASES/uart1 $ALIASES/serial1; then \
                echo 1; \
        else \
                exit 1; \
        fi \
'", SYMLINK+="serial%c"}}

This will assign {{Path|ttyS0}} and {{Path|ttyAMA0}} to the {{c|dialout}} group just as they are in Raspbian Jessie. It will also provide the {{Path|serial0}} (GPIO14:15) and {{Path|serial1}} (Bluetooth) aliases, which eases the task of switching the serial ports around between the Bluetooth and GPIO14:15.

=== Install WiFi firmware ===

The Raspberry Pi 3 WiFi requires firmware to operate. The files {{Path|brcmfmac43430-sdio.txt}} and {{Path|brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin}} are both required to be present in {{Path|/mnt/gentoo/lib/firmware/brcm}}

They can be downloaded via [https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/brcm80211 wireless.wiki.kernel.org]. Alternatively, you can also pull them from {{Path|/lib/firmware/brcm}} on an existing Raspbian installation. Copy the entire {{Path|/lib/firmware/brcm}} directory from a Raspbian install into the Gentoo {{Path|/lib/firmware}} directory.

=== Kernel ===

You'll also want to ensure that Broadcom IEEE802.11n embedded FullMAC WLAN driver with SDIO bus interface support is enabled in the kernel. In the menu shown below, this is all that needs to be enabled. You can set the FullMAC WLAN driver as a module or compile it into the kernel. If you plan to use only the on board WiFi, everything else under the Wireless LAN menu can be disabled.

Once the firmware files are copied over to {{Path|/lib/firmware/brcm}}, the appropriate kernel settings are built, and a wireless network manager (such as wpa_supplicant) is installed, the WiFi should work.

=== Install Bluetooth firmware ===

The Raspberry Pi 3B [[Bluetooth]] needs the {{Path|BCM43430A1.hcd}} firmware file, and the Raspberry Pi 3B+ needs the {{Path|BCM4345C0.hcd}} firmware file. The firmware files can be found in the Raspbian [https://github.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/tree/master/broadcom bluez-firmware] GitHub repository. The firmware files need to be placed in the {{Path|/lib/firmware/brcm}} directory.

Create the firmware directory:

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /lib/firmware/brcm}}

Fetch the Raspberry Pi 3B Bluetooth firmware:

{{RootCmd|wget -P /lib/firmware/brcm <nowiki>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/master/broadcom/BCM43430A1.hcd</nowiki>}}

Fetch the Raspberry Pi 3B+ Bluetooth firmware:

{{RootCmd|wget -P /lib/firmware/brcm <nowiki>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/master/broadcom/BCM4345C0.hcd</nowiki>}}

Attach the serial device {{Path|/dev/ttyAMA0}} to the Bluetooth stack using {{C|btattach}}:

{{RootCmd|btattach -B /dev/ttyAMA0 -P bcm -S 921600 -N &}}

Alternatively, {{C|hciattach}} can be used if {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}} is built with the <code>deprecated</code> USE flag enabled:

{{RootCmd|hciattach /dev/ttyAMA0 bcm43xx 921600 noflow -}}

Both commands will create a HCI device (e.g. {{Path|hci0}}) in {{Path|/sys/class/bluetooth}} and load the required firmware. To have the HCI device created at boot, the following [[OpenRC]] init script can be used:

{{FileBox|filename=/mnt/gentoo/etc/init.d/btattach|1=
#!/sbin/openrc-run

command="/usr/bin/btattach"
command_args="-B /dev/ttyAMA0 -P bcm -S 921600 -N"
command_background=true
pidfile="/run/btattach.pid"

depend() {
	after coldplug hotplug modules
	need localmount
}
}}

Make the init script executable:

{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/init.d/btattach}}

Start {{C|btattach}}:

{{RootCmd|rc-service btattach start}}

Start {{C|btattach}} at boot:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add btattach default}}

== Setup ==

The chroot environment is very handy as it allows you to configure your startup run levels ({{C|rc-update}}) as well as update your Portage snapshot ({{C|emerge --sync}}). Additionally, you can set the root password as well as create users in the chroot environment. 

If you plan to only access your Pi via SSH, you'll need at least networking on startup, which requires either net.eth0 or dhcpcd to be added to the default run level, as well as OpenSSH itself (sshd). 

Much of the setup prior to booting a new Gentoo install is done in a chroot. Chrooting into an arm64 install from some other arch is beyond the scope of this guide. Instead, only the bare minimum setup from outside the chroot is covered. Consult the [[Embedded Handbook/General/Compiling with qemu user chroot]] page to learn how to use qemu to establish a cross-chroot.

{{Note|The only emerge task that seems to work within an arm64 cross-chroot environment is {{C|emerge --sync}}. You have to wait to boot into the Gentoo installation on the Pi in order to emerge packages. This includes {{C|emerge -auND @world}}. But you can get all the necessary pre-boot things configured in the chroot environment.}}

=== Root Password ===

{{Important|You need this to be able to log in at all}}

There are several ways to generate a password hash for {{Path|/etc/shadow}}. I usually copy the hash from another system. My Pi uses an {{Path|/etc/shadow}} root entry:

 root:$6$xxPVR/Td5iP$/7Asdgq0ux2sgNkklnndcG4g3493kUYfrrdenBXjxBxEsoLneJpDAwOyX/kkpFB4pU5dlhHEyN0SK4eh/WpmO0::0:99999:7:::

The matching password is raspberry.

Feel free to use that line to replace the root entry in {{Path|/mnt/gentoo/etc/shadow}}

You can change the password once you are logged in.

=== {{Path|/etc/fstab}} ===

On the Pi, the microSD card will be {{Path|/dev/mmcblk0}} with partitions {{Path|/dev/mmcblk0p1}}, {{Path|/dev/mmcblk0p2}} and {{Path|/dev/mmcblk0p3}}

Edit {{Path|/mnt/gentoo/etc/fstab}} to match.

{{FileBox|filename=/mnt/gentoo/etc/fstab|1=
/dev/mmcblk0p1          /boot           vfat            noauto,noatime  1 2
/dev/mmcblk0p2          none            swap            sw              0 0
/dev/mmcblk0p3          /               ext4            noatime         0 1
}}

=== {{Path|/boot/config.txt}} ===

This file will not exist until its created. Create it with the following content.

{{FileBox|filename=/mnt/gentoo/boot/config.txt|1=
# have a properly sized image
disable_overscan=1

# lets have the VC4 hardware accelerated video
dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d

# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
dtparam=audioon

# gpu_mem is for closed-source driver only; since we are only using the
# open-source driver here, set low
gpu_mem=16
}}

=== Alternative: Use the {{Path|/boot/config.txt}} from a working Raspbian install ===

Here is a {{Path|config.txt}} file from a working Raspbian install. If the above does not work, this one should.

{{FileBox|filename=/mnt/<rpiroot>/boot/config.txt|1=
# For more options and information see
# <nowiki>http://rpf.io/configtxt</nowiki>

}}

=== {{Path|/boot/cmdline.txt}} ===

This file will not exist until its created. Create it with the following content.

{{FileBox|filename=/mnt/gentoo/boot/cmdline.txt|1=
root=/dev/mmcblk0p3 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait 
}}

This boots the Pi with a kernel command line of

 <nowiki>
8250.nr_uarts=0 cma=256M@256M dma.dmachans=0x7f35 bcm2708_fb.fbwidth=1920 bcm2708_fb.fbheight=1080 bcm2709.boardrev=0xa02082 bcm2709.serial=0x8e2830fe smsc95xx.macaddr=B8:27:EB:28:30:FE bcm2708_fb.fbswap=1 bcm2709.uart_clock=48000000 vc_mem.mem_base=0x3dc00000 vc_mem.mem_size=0x3f000000  root=/dev/mmcblk0p3 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait
</nowiki>

It really is one long line.

=== Alternative: Use {{Path|/boot/cmdline.txt}} from a working Raspbian install ===

Here is the {{Path|cmdline.txt}} file from a working Raspbian install. If the above does not work, this one should. Be sure to set <var>root</var> to your root partition, and <var>rootfstype</var> to your partition type. {{Path|/dev/mmcblk0p7}} and <code>ext4</code> are shown below as examples.

{{FileBox|filename=/mnt/<raspberry>/boot/cmdline.txt|1=
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p7 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait
}}

=== Setting the console keymap === 

This step is optional if you can log in using the default

 keymap="us"

Set the keymap to something you use, e.g.

{{FileBox|filename=/mnt/gentoo/etc/conf.d/keymaps|1=
keymap="dvorak-uk"
}}

== Boot the Pi to test ==

Unmount the microSD card.

{{RootCmd
|umount /mnt/gentoo/boot
|umount /mnt/gentoo
}}

When the prompt returns, move the microSD card to the Raspberry Pi and power on.

For 10 seconds (it seems much longer) you should see the GPU 'Rainbow' test pattern, then the familiar boot messages.

Log in at the Pi console. Nothing was added to any runlevels during the install, so networking was not started, nor anything that depends on networking, like ntpd and sshd.

The Pi does not have a hardware real time clock. Its time will be Jan 1, 1970.

== What next ==

As always with Gentoo, if it booted, that's the hard bit done.

 All The setup steps in the Gentoo Handbook
 Fix the MAC address or use a static IP
 Allow root logins via ssh 
 Add a crond, a logger and other things the handbook does before the reboot. 
 Add Kernel Sources (or at least the .config)

=== Random hints ===

==== WiFi and Bluetooth ====

It's unlikely that WiFi or Bluetooth will work at first boot. Expect to add some control tools for both.

==== CFLAGS ====

 CFLAGS="-march=armv8-a+crc -mtune=cortex-a53 -ftree-vectorize -O2 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer"

gcc-6.x allows the use of <code>-march=native</code> but that will prevent the use of distcc. The above is
the same as gcc-6.3 would set for <code>-march=native</code> anyway.

==== ACCEPT_KEYWORDS ====

Outside of the <code>@system</code> set, {{Keyword|arm64}} is either testing or keyword masked. Set

 ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arm64"

and expect to use {{Path|package.accept_keywords}} too.

{{Warning|The stage 3 tarball has been built with gcc-4.9 as gcc-5.4 is in testing ...}}

Upgrade GCC then rebuild all of the installed C++ software.

{{Important|News item 2015-10-22  GCC 5 Defaults to the New C++11 ABI}}

==== MAKEOPTS ====

With only 1G RAM, and four cores, the conventional <code>MAKEOPTS="-j5"</code> is a bit aggressive for building larger things. It will force swapping or even appear to lock up the Pi completely, to the point where it won't even respond to the console.

Use files in {{Path|/etc/portage/env/}} and entries in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.env}} to set <var>MAKEOPTS</var> on a per package basis.

==== Networking ====

{{C|dhcpcd}} is not in the stage 3, nor is <code>eth0</code> in the default runlevel.

{{RootCmd|busybox udhcpc eth0}}

will bring up <code>eth0</code>

==== sshd ====

The default configuration for {{C|sshd}} will not allow password based root logins.

 add your ssh public key for root
 make a normal user in the wheel group
 edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to allow password based root logins

=== Updating the tool chain ===

Once you boot, you may have the desire to update <code>@world</code> first thing. However, as of the time of this writing, the latest stage3 for {{Keyword|arm64}} was built in December 2016. A lot of things in the tool chain will be out of date with what is on the current Portage tree. Once you've booted the Raspberry Pi and confirmed that you have an internet connection, you'll want to first run {{C|emerge --sync}} to get the absolute latest tree, then run {{C|perl-cleaner --all}} to get all of your Perl packages up to date. 

{{RootCmd
|emerge --sync
|perl-cleaner --all
|emerge -auDN @world
}}

=== Useful packages ===

==== Network time sync ====

The Raspberry Pi 3 does not have a hardware real time clock on board. There are vendors online where you can order RTC modules made for the Pi, but if you don't plan to run one, I highly recommend installing a NTP client. 

First, we'll set the initial time using the {{C|date}} command. Date and time will be entered in <code>mmddhhmmyyyy</code> format and the time is in 24-hr format -

{{RootCmd|date mmddhhmmyyyy}}

As an example, if the time is 10:05PM on 7/31/2017 -

{{RootCmd|date 073122052017}}

As with most things Gentoo, the NTP daemon is just an emerge away -

{{Emerge|net-misc/ntp}}

Remove the hardware clock service hwclock from the boot runlevel and replace it with the software clock service swclock -

{{RootCmd
|rc-update del hwclock boot
|rc-update add swclock boot
}}

Make sure you have the correct time zone set to the area which most closely matches your locale in {{Path|/usr/share/zoneinfo}} -

{{RootCmd|ls /usr/share/zoneinfo
| echo "<YOUR_TIME_ZONE>" > /etc/timezone}}

As an example, if you live in California, you would do -

{{RootCmd|echo "America/Los_Angeles" > /etc/timezone}}

Install your timezone libraries -

{{Emerge|sys-libs/timezone-data}}

Start the NTP client and add it to the default runlevel -

{{RootCmd
|rc-service ntp-client start
|rc-update add ntp-client default
}}
