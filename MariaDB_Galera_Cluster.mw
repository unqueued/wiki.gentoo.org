= Introduction =
This is a guide for 2 node MariaDB Galera Cluster.<br />
MariaDB Galera cluster required a mininal of 3 node setup. However in this guide will only stop at 2 and you can add your new node later.<br />

{{Note|
3 Node is always a better approach when you are running HA and avoiding split brain.}}
