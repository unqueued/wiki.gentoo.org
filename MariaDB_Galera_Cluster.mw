= Introduction =
This is a guide for configuring a 3 node MariaDB Galera Cluster.<br />
A MariaDB Galera cluster requires a minimal of 3 nodes.
However, one of the members of the cluster can be an arbitrator (2 node + 1 arbitrator). Despite not participating in data replication, the arbitrator still needs to be on a 3rd physical node.<br />
<ref name="arbitrator">[http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/arbitrator.html]http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/arbitrator.html</ref>

= Design =
The Maria Galera Cluster is multi master cluster featuring synchronous writes across all nodes.
Each node requires a static IP address to function.

If you have a local dns server, you can make use of that. else make use of your hosts file.
This will make your system clear about the other nodes and ip address.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/hosts|title=add you hostname if you don't have it|
127.0.0.1   localhost
192.168.10.11   node01
192.168.10.12   node02
192.168.10.13   node03

= Packages =


Add the galera useflag to MariaDB:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|title=enable galera replication support |
dev-db/mariadb galera
}}

Add the garbd useflag (only) on the arbitrator. If you have 3 nodes you can skip this useflag.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|title=add this extra useflag|
sys-cluster/galera garbd
}}

Then, emerge the following packages:
{{Emerge|dev-db/mariadb sys-cluster/galera}}

{{USEflag|package=dev-db/mariadb-galera}}

{{USEflag|package=sys-cluster/galera}}

== Start mariadb on the first node ==

When a node starts, by default it assumes that the cluster is already initialised and tries to join it. If no node is initialised, the cluster will not be able to start since all nodes will just try to join a (non) existing cluster.
Therefore, the first node in the cluster to be online needs to be instructed to become a "new" cluster (read into [http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/startingcluster.html#starting-the-first-cluster-node STARTING THE FIRST CLUSTER NODE] for more defaults):

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/mysql bootstrap_galera}}


== Start mariadb on other nodes ==
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/mysql start}}

== Checking if all nodes have joined and are running correctly ==
Try to run this command on node 1:
{{RootCmd|mysql -u root -p|output=<pre>
Enter password:

If the cluster size is equal to you node size you are good to go.
And wsrep_ready meant the cluster is ON.

== Garbd Arbitrator Configuration ==
{{Note|
This is still a physical 3 node, just not running mariadb.}}

{{Warning | While the Galera Arbitrator does not participate in replication, it does receive the same data as all other nodes. You must secure its network connection.<ref name="arbitrator">[http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/arbitrator.html]http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/arbitrator.html</ref> }}

{{Warning | Unless this has been fixed in your installation, [https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtradb-cluster/+bug/1365193 garbd does not work when specifying cluster address without the port]. Make sure to include the port numbers as shown below. }}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/garbd|title=Make the change below|<nowiki>
# A space-separated list of node addresses (address[:port]) in the cluster
GALERA_NODES="192.168.0.10:4567 192.168.0.11:4567"

# Galera cluster name, should be the same as on the rest of the nodes.
GALERA_GROUP="my_mariadb_cluster"
</nowiki>}}

{{Note|
Not idea why, but cannot turn on Log or it will not start}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/garbd start}}

= Finalize configuration =
The Mariadb cluster should now be up.

== Start mariadb on boot ==
For openrc, do:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add mysql default|output=<pre>
 * service mysql added to runlevel default
</pre>}}

= Secure mariadb =
Secure your mariadb for production use
{{RootCmd|mysql_secure_installation}}
