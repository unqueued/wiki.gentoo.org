= Introduction =
This is a guide for 3 node MariaDB Galera Cluster.<br />
MariaDB Galera cluster required a minimal of 3 node setup. However in this guide will only stop at 2 and you can add your new node later.<br />

{{Note|
Can't get 2 node working with garbd thus change to 3 node guide.}}

= Design =
The Maria Galera Cluster are multi master cluster which have synchronous write across all node.
Basically each node required an static ip address for it to function 

If you have a local dns server, you can make use of that. else make use of your hosts file.
This will make your system clear about the other nodes and ip address.
{{File|/etc/hosts|add you hostname if you don't have it|<pre>
127.0.0.1   localhost
192.168.10.11   node01
192.168.10.12   node02
192.168.10.13   node03
</pre>}}

If everything is running smoothly, start the next node and on.

If the cluster size is equal to you node size you are good to go.
And wsrep_ready meant the cluster is ON.

== Garbd Configuration--Not working yet ==
{{Note|
Not required if you have 3 node or more}}

= Finalize configuration =
The Mariadb cluster is now up.
We still need to make some final change.

== Node01 ==
{{File|/etc/mysql/my.cnf|Make the change below|<pre>

# We will come back to change this again later

Secure your mariadb for production use
