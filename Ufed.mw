'''ufed''' is a ncurses-based USE flag editor designed to simplify configuration of a system's USE flags. 

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

There are currently no available USE flags for <tt>ufed</tt> itself. The irony!

=== Emerge ===

A simple <tt>emerge</tt> installs <tt>ufed</tt>:

{{Emerge|app-portage/ufed}}

== Usage ==

Start the program from a command-line with the <tt>ufed</tt> command. It may take a few seconds for the program to open; do not be alarmed if it seems like nothing is happening, just wait a little longer.

{{RootCmd|ufed}}

{{Note|Since <tt>ufed</tt> has the ability to modify important system files, it must be started using the equivalent of root privileges. Normal users can use <tt>[[sudo]]</tt> if it is installed on the system.}}

Close the program by pressing {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|C}}.

=== Navigation ===
