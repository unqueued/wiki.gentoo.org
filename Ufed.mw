'''ufed''' is a ncurses-based USE flag editor designed to simplify configuration of a system's USE flags. 

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

There are currently no available USE flags for {{Package|app-portage/ufed}} itself. The irony!

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|{{Package|app-portage/ufed}}}}

== Usage ==
[[File:Ufed-0.92_screenshot.png|200px|thumb|right|Screenshot of {{Package|app-portage/ufed}}-0.92]]
Start the program from a command-line with the {{c|ufed}} command. It may take a few seconds for the program to open; do not be alarmed if it seems like nothing is happening, just wait a little longer.

{{RootCmd|ufed}}

{{Note|Since {{c|ufed}} has the ability to modify important system files, it can only be started using the equivalent of root privileges. Normal users can use {{c|[[sudo]]}} if it is installed on the system, otherwise access to the root account is needed.}}
