'''ufed''' is a ncurses-based USE flag editor designed to simplify configuration of a system's USE flags. 

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

There are currently no available USE flags for <tt>ufed</tt> itself. The irony!

=== Emerge ===

A simple <tt>emerge</tt> installs <tt>ufed</tt>:

{{Emerge|app-portage/ufed}}

== Usage ==

Start the program from a command-line by typing the <tt>ufed</tt> command and pressing {{Key|Enter}}. It may take a few seconds for the program to open; do not be alarmed if it seems like nothing is happening, just wait a little longer...

Close the program by pressing {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|C}}.

=== Navigation ===

Hot keys include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Key !! Description
|-
| {{Key|Up}} {{Key|Down}}, {{Key|Page Up}} {{Key|Page Down}}, {{Key|Home}} {{Key|End}} || Move between flags.
|-
| {{Key|←}} {{Key|→}} || Scroll though the USE flag descriptions. This is helpful if the description text is concatenated by the screen or terminal resolution.
|-
| {{Key|Space}} || Toggles the flag on or off.
|-
| {{Key|/}} || Searches the listed flags.
|-
| {{Key|F5}} || Toggles the display of local, global, or all flag descriptions.
|-
| {{Key|F6}} || Toggles display of flags supported by at least one installed package, supported by no installed package, or all flags.
|-
| {{Key|F7}} || Toggle display of masked and forced flags, flags that are neither masked nor forced, or all flags.
|-
| {{Key|F10}} || Change the description to show full or reduced descriptions.
|-
| {{Key|F11}} || Change the display to wrap long lines into multiple lines.
|-
| {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|C}} || Closes the program.
|}

=== Search ===

Search can be performed two ways:

# Typing the name of a flag;
# Pressing the {{Key|/}} key and ''then'' typing the name of the flag.
