'''F'''ilesystem in '''U'''ser'''s'''pac'''e''' (FUSE) provides a way for users to mount file systems without needing special permissions (mounting in Linux is generally reserved to those with administrative privileges).

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

{{KernelBox|title=Enable support for FUSE|1=
File systems  --->
    <*> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support
}}

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/fuse}}

=== Emerge ===

As with most file systems, after building support for the file system into the kernel be sure to install the user space tools:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/fuse}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

The following configuration files are available for FUSE:

* {{Path|/etc/fuse.conf}}

There are two configuration variables available in the {{Path|fuse.conf}} file:

* <var>mount_max</var> - Sets the maximum number of FUSE mounts allowed to non-root users (defaults to 1000 if unset).
* <var>user_allow_other</var> - Allows non-root users to specify the <code>allow_other</code> or <code>allow_root</code> mount options. This is disabled for security reasons.

== Usage ==

=== Invocation ===

{{Cmd|fusermount -h|output=<pre>
fusermount: [options] mountpoint
Options:
 -h                 print help
 -V                 print version
 -o opt[,opt...]   mount options
 -u                 unmount
 -q                 quiet
 -z                 lazy unmount
</pre>}}

=== Mounting filesystems ===

Use the {{c|fusermount}} command:

{{Cmd|fusermount /path/to/mountpoint}}

=== Unmounting filesystems ===

Filesystems can be unmounted using either the {{c|umount}} ''or'' the {{c|fusermount}} command:

{{Cmd|fusermount -u /path/to/mountpoint}}

== Removal ==

{{Emerge|params+=--unmerge|sys-fs/fuse}}
