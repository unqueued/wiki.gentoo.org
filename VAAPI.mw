'''VAAPI''' ('''V'''ideo '''A'''cceleration '''API''') provides access to graphics hardware (GPU) acceleration for video processing.

== Installation ==
Portage knows the global USE flag ''vaapi'' for enabling support for VAAPI in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|x11-libs/libva}} automatically:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||
USE{{=}}"... vaapi ..."
}}
The USE flags of libva are:
{{USEflag|package=x11-libs/libva
|opengl+yes
|vdpau
|dummy+++VIDEO_CARDS USE flag: dummy driver
|intel+++VIDEO_CARDS USE flag:see [[Intel]]
|fglrx+++VIDEO_CARDS USE flag:see [[fglrx]]
|nvidia+++VIDEO_CARDS USE flag:see [[nVidia/nvidia-drivers|nvidia-drivers]]
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Configuration ==
You may need to tweak the config files of the programs, you can make use of VAAPI.

== Usage ==
'''vainfo''' shows if VAAPI is supported.

== Software support ==
=== VLC ===
Vlc supports Vaapi natively. Activate the appropriate codecs through the Preferences Menu (VA API Acceleration).
=== MPV ===
Mpv also supports the vaapi acceleration through the commandline option --hwdec=vaapi
=== Mplayer ===
As of now, main branch Mplayer doesn't support vaapi. There is a development branch though that brings vaapi support. the branch is hwaccel-vaapi, available at gitorious.
https://gitorious.org/vaapi/mplayer/source/1923fa10ed77bbf8408f2ce312d85a97dab1f0f3:

It doesn't seem there is a proper ebuild providing mplayer-vaapi, even on the overlays

You can use the following commands to get a vaapi enabled mplayer
{{Cmd|git clone -b hwaccel-vaapi git://gitorious.org/vaapi/mplayer.git vaapi-mplayer
|cd vaapi-mplayer
|./configure --disable-vdpau --enable-vaapi
|make}}
You will get yourself an executable, that you can install with the ''not recommanded'' following procedure :
{{RootCmd|make install}}
{{Warning|Be extremely careful when installing anything on your system aside of portage, since it can conflict with the installed files}}

Instead, configure a player like smplayer to use your special executable (Preferences/Mplayer executable), then video driver (User defined/vaapi)
