As variáveis <var>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</var> são anexadas à linha de comando do emerge. Muitas vezes são usadas para permitir operações concorrentes do emerge através das opções <code>--jobs <var>N</var></code> e <code>--load-average <var>X.Y</var></code>, que informam ao Portage quantas compilações de pacotes paralelos podem ser usadas e até qual carga do sistema (load average) o paralelismo pode ser usado.

== Common use cases ==

=== Parallel builds ===

With <code>--jobs <var>N</var></code> (short form: <code>-j<var>N</var></code>), {{c|emerge}} runs <var>N</var> jobs at a time (without an argument, <code>-j</code> will flood the processor with as many jobs as possible, and is not recommended). A typical value for <var>N</var> would be equal to the number of cores.

<onlyinclude>For example, to run up to three jobs in parallel:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Enabling 3 parallel package builds|lang=bash|1=
EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS="--jobs 3"
}}<includeonly>

For more information, see the [[EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS|EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS]] article.</includeonly></onlyinclude>

When used with <code>--load-average <var>X.Y</var></code> (short form: <code>-l<var>X.Y</var></code>), emerge will try to keep the load average of the system less than <var>X.Y</var>, a floating point number. If <code>--jobs</code> is set as well, then it will run up to the limit indicated by that parameter.

The load average value is the same as displayed by {{c|top}} or {{c|uptime}}, and for an <var>N</var>-core system, a load average of <code><var>N</var>.0</code> would be a 100% load. Another rule of thumb here is to set <code><var>X.Y</var>=<var>N</var>*0.9</code> which will limit the load to 90%, thus maintaining responsiveness.

{{Note|When <code>MAKEOPTS{{=}}"-jN"</code> is used with <code>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS{{=}}"--jobs K --load-average X.Y"</code> the number of possible tasks created would be up to <code>N*K</code>. Therefore, both variables need to be set with each other in mind as they create up to K jobs each with up to N tasks.}}

These two settings are suited for long emerges which include multiple source code files to make the most of the <code>--jobs</code> parameter. They can also cause emerge errors in some cases, so use with caution and be prepared to comment these out if problems arise.
