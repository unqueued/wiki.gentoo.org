=== Using Github ===
==== Testing before committing ====

we can just send a pull request toward a branch with the needed changes to https://github.com/gentoo/linux-patches

==== Stabilizing ====

still under work

=== Using Git ===

With git we are using a time check done every 10 minutes.  <br>
So the build can take some time before starting.

==== Testing before committing ====

making a branch like 4.11_001 will test the new commit in the new branch
{{RootCmd
|git checkout 4.11
|git branch 4.11_001}}
change files
{{RootCmd
|git push -u origin 4.11_001}}
check [http://kernel1.amd64.dev.gentoo.org:8010/#/console buildbot] that is building the pushed branch

==== Stabilizing ====

making a tag like 4.11_stabilize will try to test the branch in different architecture for stabilization.
{{RootCmd
|git tag -a 4.11_stabilize 9fceb02}}
