==== Todo (if you have any idea please add it here): ====

* Test kernel if tagged as stabilize
* create Qemu kernel testing image
* add possibility to reboot the machine and get the dmesg (using serial console emulator with qemu)
(maybe from u-boot or using grub https://statusq.org/archives/2012/10/24/4584/ https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/legacy/Booting-once_002donly.html)
* use a kernel testing suit like (https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp) or https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kselftest.txt

=== Using Github ===

With Github changes are immediate, there is no need to wait.
The result is also display near the commit on Github.

==== Testing before committing ====

we can just send a pull request toward a branch with the needed changes to https://github.com/gentoo/linux-patches

=== Using Git ===

With git we are using a time check done every 10 minutes.  <br>
So the build can take some time before starting.

==== Testing before committing ====

making a branch like 4.11_001 will test the new commit in the new branch
{{RootCmd
|git checkout 4.11
|git branch 4.11_001}}
change files
{{RootCmd
|git push -u origin 4.11_001}}
check [http://kernel1.amd64.dev.gentoo.org:8010/#/console buildbot] that is building the pushed branch

for removing the branch
{{RootCmd
|git push origin --delete 4.11_001}}
for removing it locally
{{RootCmd
|git branch -D 4.11_001}}

=== Stabilizing ===

pushing files to git.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git will start to run some test for stabilizing the package.<br>
enabled only for:<br>
sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-*<br>
<br>
