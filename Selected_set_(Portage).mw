The '''selected set''' contains the packages the user has explicitly asked to be installed. It is part of the [[World set (Portage)|''world set'']] together with the [[System set (Portage)|''system set'']].

Whenever a user triggers a software installation (through the {{c|emerge}} command) the software's package category and name are registered in the {{Path|/var/lib/portage/world}} file. 

{{Note|The the examples below, replace <tt><nowiki><package-name></nowiki></tt> with an actual package atom.}}

To add a package to the ''selected set'' without recompiling, use:

{{Emerge|params+=--noreplace|<package-name>}}

To install a package ''without'' adding it to the ''selected set'', use:

{{Emerge|params+=--oneshot|<package-name>}}
