Whenever a user triggers a software installation (through '''emerge <package-name>''') the software's package category and name are registered in the selected file. Later, when a world update is requested (through '''emerge -uDN @world''' or similar), Portage will use this file as the base for its update calculations.

If you want to add a package to the world set without recompiling, use:
{{Emerge|params+=--noreplace|<package-name>}}

If you want to install a package without adding it to the world set, use:
{{Emerge|params+=--oneshot|<package-name>}}
