'''The selected set contains the packages the user has explicitly asked to be installed .  It is part of the [[World|world]] set together  with the [[System|system]] set.'''


Whenever a user triggers a software installation (through '''emerge <package-name>''') the software's package category and name are registered in the {{Path|/var/lib/portage/world}} file. 

If you want to add a package to the ''selected'' set without recompiling, use:
{{Emerge|params+=--noreplace|<package-name>}}

If you want to install a package without adding it to the selected set, use:
{{Emerge|params+=--oneshot|<package-name>}}
