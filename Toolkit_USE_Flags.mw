This page summarizes main points from discussions about toolkit (GTK, QT) USE flags (gtk2, gtk3, qt4, qt5, etc). The centithreads go back to 2005. It seems sometimes the discussion is going in circles, and it's hard to read all of the previous replies. This is an attempt to summarize the main points, pros and cons, to facilitate a more productive and informed effort towards a usable solution.

List of use cases (i.e. scenarios people want to work, or things that happen with packages, etc)
* Enable just gtk2 for just gtk2 support if available [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/rtlwoHjhA-4/Cl95_f35AtoJ]
* app-i18n/uim , x11-themes/light-themes --> flag provides support for gtk3 apps, in addition to gtk(2) [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/Y1PF_2XlFKI/DwEM3Q45YvQJ]
* gnome-base/librsvg --> flag for gtk3 libraries *and* executables [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/Y1PF_2XlFKI/DwEM3Q45YvQJ]
* media-sound/audacious --> REQUIRED_USE="^^ ( gtk gtk3 )" with default switching from version to version (current stable is gtk, previous was gtk3) [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/Y1PF_2XlFKI/DwEM3Q45YvQJ]
* www-client/midori --> USE=deprecated instead of USE=gtk3 in unstable [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/Y1PF_2XlFKI/DwEM3Q45YvQJ]
* www-client/uget --> for once, a "simple" USE=gtk3 that enables gtk3 instead of gtk (gtk3 support still experimental?) [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/Y1PF_2XlFKI/DwEM3Q45YvQJ]
* media-libs/libcanberra --> USE=gtk3 enables extra support, in addition to gtk: "Enables building of gtk+3 helper library, gtk+3 runtime sound effects and the canberra-gtk-play utility. To enable the gtk+3 sound effects add canberra-gtk-module to the colon separated list of modules in the GTK_MODULES environment variable." â€” very unclear: is it needed? recommended? also, why doesn't the package handle the environment variable by itself? [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/Y1PF_2XlFKI/DwEM3Q45YvQJ]
* we need to ship webkit with gtk2 and gtk3 support [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/Y1PF_2XlFKI/jbd8VHFyucgJ]
* MATE desktop (which I hope to bring in to Portage soon) can be built against gtk+ 2 or gtk+ 3, and upstream supports doing both [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/dLGhvTXUFfw/K26zZGrBk5UJ]
* a single process cannot load both gtk2 and gtk3 - you *will* get random crashes [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/dLGhvTXUFfw/K3wlmjxzbo4J]

gtk = any version, gtkN = gtkN support

* what does "-gtk gtk2" mean? [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/rtlwoHjhA-4/hVKV8Ig3VwwJ]
* what does "gtk gtk2" mean? [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/QZHlXwY7Deg/U4DNXFl6Yi0J]
* how to build without gtk support where possible, but when necessary prefer gtk2 over gtk1? [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/rtlwoHjhA-4/ZwlkN4Frh90J]
* is there a legitimate reason to use gtk1 if gtk2 support is usable? [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/QZHlXwY7Deg/E0lQAgy561cJ]
* why REQUIRED_USE? A package can prefer one of the alternatives if both flags are specified [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/dLGhvTXUFfw/GavtXZBxGxgJ]

* no need to globally mandate which version is default [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/rtlwoHjhA-4/Yjm44csFa94J]

* gtk2 may be pulled even with USE="-gtk2" [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/QZHlXwY7Deg/haS92decWNsJ]
* users have to use USE='gtk gtk3' to get GUIs in random applications that support only one toolkit. And then handle REQUIRED_USE mess for packages that support choosing one of the two [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/dLGhvTXUFfw/EC2Sta99NgEJ]
* may create problem for distro as a whole, i.e. what flags to put in default profiles [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux.gentoo.dev/dLGhvTXUFfw/BAtOBHioLDsJ]

remove gtkN, make latest version default, possibly add USE flags for deprecated versions
