이 글은 여러분이 버그 보고서를 제출할 때 다른 사람들을 편하게 하기 위해 지쳐야할 여러가지 사항을 다룹니다. 항상 기억해두시고, 여러분이 제기한 문제를 원하는대로 다룬다는 사실을 항상 기억하십시오:

== 일반 정보 ==

''제출 전에 다시 읽어주십시오''. 바꾼 내용은 되돌릴 수 없고 제출한 다음에 다시 편집할 수 없습니다. 버그 보고서에 입력한 텍스트는 수많은 사람들에게 즉시 전자메일로 발송합니다.

=== 새 버그 보고서 만들기 ===

''중복 여부를 검색하십시오''. 누군가는 문제를 이미 보고했을지도 모릅니다. 새 버그 보고서를 만드는 방법을 안내했으니 절차를 신중하게 읽으십시오. 분류를 선택했다면, 중복을 피하기 위해 최근 제출한 버그 보고서 목록을 보여줍니다.

=== Adding information to another bug ===

* ''Always stay on topic'' - A bug tracker is used for technical reports and chitchat should be avoided. Keep them in the forums, IRC or mailing-lists. 
* ''Only confirm the existence of a problem once.'' - It does not help solving the problem, if you and another person report it twice. But if your and the confirmer's systems differ in an obvious way and that would be helpful to know, add this information. 
* ''Do not hijack other bugs.'' - If your problem is not discussed on a bug, search for one related to your issue or create a new report.
* ''No talk on tracker bugs.'' - Those bugs are meta bugs. If you want to add useful information, add them to a related sub bug or create a new bug.

== 꾸러미/이빌드 ==

You should always add information about your system configuration to the bug. To do so, create a new attachment and paste the contents of:

{{Cmd|emerge --info|}}

=== 빌드할 때 일어나는 문제 ===

Files and information of interest ordered by priority:

* The exact version of the package in the title of the bug report e.g. ''sys-apps/package-2.3-r4''
* If possible, add parts of the error message to the title 
* The logfile in {{Path|/var/tmp/portage/<category>/<packagename>/temp/build.log}}
** If your logfile is too big to upload, compress it: {{Cmd| gzip {{Path|/var/tmp/portage/<category>/<packagename>/temp/build.log}}}} and upload build.log.gz from this directory
* The output of ''emerge --info <category/packagename>''

=== 실행할 때 일어나는 문제 ===

Files and information of interest ordered by priority:

* The exact version of the package in the title of the bug report e.g. ''sys-apps/package-2.3-r4 crashes with error: Cannot proceed...''
* Description of the problem, so that other can reproduce it:
** How is the program run (on the console, in a terminal, as a daemon, in what runlevel etc.)
** Any error output
** What makes the program crash, behave wrong, not start
** Is there a workaround?
** What was the last working version of the package, if any?
** What changed to make it not work?
* The output of ''emerge --info''
* The output of ''emerge -pv <packagename>'' to quickly see what are the dependencies

=== XY 꾸러미를 새 버전으로 릴리즈 함 ===

업스트림 웹사이트에서는 새 릴리즈를 출시했음을 알립니다:

* 출시 알림 후 24시간은 보내게 해주십시오. 이미 개발자가 작업중일지도 모릅니다.
* 버그 보고서에 업스트림 웹사이트를 연결해주십시오
* 고친 버그나 새 기능 목록이 있다면 링크를 제시해주십시오

If providing new information for the upgraded ebuild (optional):

* If the new version needs no changes to the ebuild's contents, please indicate such
* Test the ebuild in a local overlay before submitting attachments
* Provide patches for proposed ebuild edits, with optional explanation of changes (file name should match the new version number, not old)
* Provide additional files (initd, unit files) as separate attachments (as needed)
* Do not paste ebuilds or other ebuild-related file contents directly into comments; use attachments for those

=== XY 꾸러미가 포티지에 있어야 함 ===

If you request a new ebuild for a software to be added to portage, you must find or become a maintainer for the package:

* Link to the upstream website in the bug report
* Give a link or list of features
* Provide an ebuild and patches that were tested in the local overlay (you can get help in IRC or in the forums with that)
* Contact the people at [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/sunrise/ Sunrise Overlay]

=== Package XY should be marked stable ===

A package is building and working without problems on the system for more than 30 days but is still marked as unstable:

* See [[KEYWORDS]] for more information on stable/unstable branch
* Did you test the version you want to become stable thoroughly?
* Are there other bug reports regarding this bug?
* Was the version of the package added to the tree at least 30 days ago?
* Are its dependencies all marked stable?

== 커널 ==

Files and information of interest for kernel bug reports ordered by priority:

* Which kernel and version is used, on what architecture e.g. ''gentoo-sources-3.4.2-r2'' on ''x86_64''
* The kernel configuration file should be attached to the bug report {{Path|/usr/src/linux/.config}}
* A list of all devices in the system can be acquired with ''lspci -k''
* Log files during kernel initialization should be attached {{Path|/var/log/dmesg}} or {{Path|/var/log/messages}}

{{Note|On request a [[kernel git-bisect]] could be done to identify bad patches.}}

== 다른 버그 보고 ==

There is no real template, this falls under the category like problems with captcha on wiki.gentoo.org, forum.gentoo.org is down or anything else that is not really related to software.
