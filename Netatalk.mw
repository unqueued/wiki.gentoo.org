'''Netatalk''' is a free, open-source implementation of the Apple Filing Protocol. It allows Unix-like operating systems to serve as file, print and time servers for Macintosh computers.

== Installation ==

Install {{Package|net-fs/netatalk}}:
{{Emerge|net-fs/netatalk}}

== Configuration ==

In this example, the icon model that appears on clients is a Mac Pro and all private IPv4 hosts are allowed access to a Time Machine volume.

Creating the /mnt/storage/TimeMachine folder
{{RootCmd|mkdir /mnt/storage/TimeMachine}}

Allow all users read+write access. In practice a more secure configuration should be used with uam list = "uams_dhx.so uams_dhx2.so"
{{RootCmd|chmod 777 /mnt/storage/TimeMachine}}

Edit /etc/afp.conf
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/afp.conf|1=
[Global]
	mimic model = MacPro
	hosts allow = 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/20 192.168.0.0/16
	uam list = uams_guest.so
[TimeMachine]
	path = /mnt/storage/TimeMachine
	time machine = yes
}}

To start {{c|netatalk}}:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/netatalk start}}
To start {{c|netatalk}} at boot:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add netatalk default}}
