'''egencache''' is a software tool that rebuilds metadata information for the Portage tree.

Metadata for the Portage tree comes with tarballs and can be downloaded using the <code>emerge --sync</code> command (via rsync), but will not be downloaded when using cvs checkout for your Portage sync method.

==Installation==
Since almost every Gentoo install comes with Portage by default, you should already have '''egencache''' installed on your system. Run a quick test by issuing the following command to a root terminal:

{{RootCmd|egencache --jobs{{=}}8 --update --repo gentoo}}
