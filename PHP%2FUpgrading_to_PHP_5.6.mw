To upgrade a system to PHP 5.6, first set the <var>PHP_TARGETS</var> variable in {{Path|make.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Setting the target PHP version|lang=bash|1=
PHP_TARGETS="php5-6"
}}

== Installation ==

Install PHP 5.6:

{{Emerge|dev-lang/php:5.6}}

== Replace APC ==

To build with the <code>opcache</code> USE flag (the default) while allowing the use of APC userland functions such as <code>apc_fetch()</code>, install APCu, which emulates APC but only has user caching functions. This may be necessary for older projects that rely on APC for caching.

If necessary, unmask it:

{{RootCmd|echo 'dev-php/pecl-apcu ~amd64' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}

Install APCu:

{{Emerge|dev-php/pecl-apcu}}

For PHP 7 compatibility:

{{Emerge|dev-php/pecl-apcu_bc}}

== Switch to PHP 5.6 ==

Switch to it using {{c|eselect}} for all SAPIs:

{{RootCmd
|eselect php set cli php5.6
|eselect php set fpm php5.6
}}

When other SAPIs are in  use, be sure to run {{c|eselect}} for those as well.

== Re-install compatible extensions ==

Since changing <var>PHP_TARGETS</var> is technically a USE flag change, it suffices to simply {{c|emerge @world}} with flags checking for new USE flags and all extensions should re-build.

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Uninstall incompatible extensions ==

Remove all old extensions that do not build for PHP 5.6. {{c|eix}} can be used for this task. Note that when piping to emerge, interactive mode cannot be used so <code>--ask</code> on the {{c|emerge}} command is not applicable here.

{{Emerge|app-portage/eix}}

{{RootCmd|eix -I -C dev-php --use php_targets_php5-5 --not --use php_targets_php5-6 --only-names {{!}} xargs emerge -c}}

Be sure to migrate USE flags if versions have been specified in the {{Path|package.use}} file(s).

Now that extensions have been removed, it may be useful to run a dependency clean up at this point for older ones that are no longer compatible.

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --depclean}}

== Migrate the configuration files ==

The different slots have different configuration paths. Please take care to migrate the configuration files before making use of a new slot.

== Uninstall old PHP versions ==

For example, to remove PHP 5.5:

{{Emerge|params+=-vc|dev-lang/php:5.5}}

== Restart PHP-FPM ==

Restart PHP-FPM if applicable:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/php-fpm restart}}
