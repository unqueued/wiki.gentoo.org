=== KDE SC 4 ===

KDE SC 4 is the previous major version of KDE. There is no more feature development, but it is still supported by upstream with bugfix releases. It is considered stable, and is recommended for most users.

Choose which KDE SC version is most appropriate: 

<!-- Not translating this part as it moves too much, we do lose the "testing for" translations due to this. -->

{{Note|As upstream support for KDE SC 4 slowly comes to an end, certain packages have releases with versions that do not match (but work fine with) the rest of the SC. For example, kdelibs enjoys further point releases, as does KDE Workspaces (as 4.11.x).}}

=== KDE Frameworks, Plasma, and Applications ===

The next generation of KDE splits the SC into three components, each with their own individual release cycles: KDE Frameworks 5, KDE Plasma 5, and KDE Applications.

== Prerequisites ==

=== Profile ===

Choosing a KDE desktop [[profile]], although not required, is recommended as it sets a number of global and package-specific USE flags to ease installation and ensure a smooth KDE experience.

In order to choose the most suitable profile, run the following command to list the available profiles:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile list}}

Then, select the right profile with the following command, substituting <code>X</code> with the appropriate number of the profile:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set X}}

For a full KDE desktop environment it is recommended to use the ''desktop/kde'' [[profile]], which is specially tailored for KDE with OpenRC. If KDE with systemd is to be used, it is recommended to use the ''desktop/kde/systemd'' [[profile]], which is specially tailored for KDE with systemd.

=== サービス ===

Before installing KDE SC it is recommended that several other services are set up first. Part of that is done automatically if a ''desktop/kde'' or ''desktop'' [[profile]] is used. These services are: 
* [[D-Bus]]: Enables use of the D-Bus message bus system.
* [[polkit]]: Enables the polkit framework for controlling privileges for system-wide services.
* [[udev]]: Enables support for udev Linux dynamic and persistent device naming.
* [[udisks]]: Enables support for some storage related services.

Follow the links for information how to set up these services. Note that other USE flag combinations than set in this profile may technically be possible (especially if selected applications re ran instead of a full KDE desktop environment), but may be unsupported, untested, or lead to unexpected loss of functionality.

=== X サーバー ===

Read and follow the instructions in the [[X server]] article to setup the X environment.

== インストール ==

{{Note|For update instructions, check the [[/upgrade|upgrade subpage]].}}

{{Note|For live versions see the [[KDE/Overlay|kde overlay]] article.}}

=== パッケージ ===

In Gentoo there are various packages that will install a KDE environment:
* {{Package|kde-base/kde-meta}}, the full KDE suite
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}, a basic KDE environment
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-startkde}}, a very minimal, effectively unsupported KDE environment (no KDE applications or artwork)

It is usually a good idea to start with the {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}} package and install the additional software when needed:

{{Emerge|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}

There are other meta packages that can be installed to pull in parts of the KDE suite:
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeaccessibility-meta}}: Accessibility applications and utilities.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeadmin-meta}}: Administrative utilities, which helps in managing the system.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeartwork-meta}}: Extra themes, screensavers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebindings-meta}}: Bindings for various languages.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeedu-meta}}: Educational applications and games.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegames-meta}}: Standard desktop games.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegraphics-meta}}: Graphics applications such as image viewers, color pickers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdemultimedia-meta}}: Audio and video playback applications and services.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdenetwork-meta}}: Network applications and VNC services.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-meta}}: PIM applications such as emailer, addressbook, organizer, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdesdk-meta}}: Various development tools.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdetoys-meta}}: Toy like applications.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeutils-meta}}: Standard desktop utilities such as a archiver, a calculator, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdewebdev-meta}}: Web development tools.

=== ローカライゼーション ===

To [[localization|localize]] the KDE installation, install the {{Package|kde-base/kde-l10n}} package. If only a selected few languages needs to set, define the <code>LINGUAS</code> variable beforehand in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}

E.g. to use the German language, set:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Setting the LINGUAS variable for the German language|lang=bash|1=
LINGUAS="de"
}}

{{Emerge|kde-base/kde-l10n}}

To localize the packages included in {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-meta}} install the {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-l10n}} package.

{{Package|app-office/calligra}} has its own localization package too: {{package|app-office/calligra-l10n}}.

== 設定 ==

=== Boot service ===

KDM (KDE Display Manager) is the recommended login manager for KDE SC (SDDM for KDE Frameworks/Plasma 5).

==== OpenRC ====

Set KDM as the default [[display manager]]:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|title=Setting KDM as the default display manager|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
}}

To start KDM on boot, add xdm to the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

To start KDM now:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

==== Systemd ====

Enable KDM at boot time through <tt>systemctl</tt>:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable kdm}}

Now run the following command to start the service:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start kdm}}

== アドオンソフトウェア ==

=== ウィジェット ===

Many useful widget are in the {{Package|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}} package:

{{Emerge|kdeplasma-addons}}

=== More KDE software ===

The most important KDE applications are in the portage tree and many are located in the [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-base kde-base] and [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-misc kde-misc] categories.
