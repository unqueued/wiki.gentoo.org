== About the Gentoo releases ==

=== Gentoo versions ===

One of Gentoo's major advantages is that it does not really know ''versions''. Once installed, the user has a Gentoo installation, not a Gentoo 2005.1 or 2004.3 installation. Therefore users will continue to benefit from the Gentoo development with every system update performed - there is no need to run through a specific upgrade procedure every time Gentoo makes a new release.

This is also reflected by the pace at which Gentoo provides new installation media: through an auto-build process, new media are provided on a weekly basis (for active architectures). These auto-builds contain all the necessary media to install Gentoo with, and is also the medium that we will use throughout this handbook.

=== Gentoo LiveDVD releases ===

Occasionally, Gentoo will create a Gentoo LiveDVD from which one can play with a Gentoo OS before installing it. These releases are announced on the [http://www.gentoo.org/ main Gentoo website].

{{Important|Understand that the Gentoo installation procedure is a ''manual'' procedure, requiring lots of input from the administrator}}

=== The structure of a Gentoo Linux installation ===

Understand that the Gentoo installation procedure is quite different from most other Linux distributions: where other distributions try to perform most steps for the user, Gentoo Linux asks the user politely (but firmly) to do things actively.

Getting the hardware up and running, configuring the network, partitioning the disk(s), copying over the initial files, building additional software (including the kernel), ... all these steps should be performed before one can finally boot in a minimal Gentoo environment. Not that all these steps can't be automated (Gentoo even offers tools to automate a few of those steps and there might still be a few unofficial installers that automate most - if not all - steps) but by documenting these steps in great detail Gentoo almost forces the user to learn various Linux-related procedures.

The structure of a Gentoo installation is as follows:

# Download and boot a bootable system from which Gentoo can be installed
# Prepare the disk(s) and partitions to host Gentoo
# Download and extract the latest archive (stage file) which creates a minimal Gentoo environment to further install from
# Chroot into this minimal Gentoo environment and install a Linux kernel, core utilities and boot loader
# Reboot into the freshly installed Gentoo system

A huge advantage of letting the user perform all steps himself is that the user can now decide himself how he wants to install Gentoo - the options are there, the user needs to make a choice, over and over again. By clearly identifying the options and documenting the possible roads Gentoo hopes that the user is not scared but rather impressed.

== Download, burn and boot ==

In order to boot a medium from which Gentoo can be installed, the first thing to know is for which architecture the installation should be done.

{{Note|An architecture is a family of CPUs (processors) who support the same instructions. The two most prominent architectures in the desktop world are the x86 architecture and the x86_64 architecture (for which Gentoo uses the amd64 notation). But many other architectures exist, such as sparc, ppc (the PowerPC family), mips, arm, ...}}

Gentoo supports a number of architectures, namely:

! Information
! Example systems or CPUs
|-
| x86
| x86
| A 32-bit architecture used by CPUs that are often said to be "Intel compatible". It was, until recently, the most popular architecture for desktop PCs. Gentoo offers builds for i486 (supports all families) and i686 (supports Pentium and higher or compatible). 
| i486, i686, Intel Core, AMD Athlon, Intel Atom
|-
| x86_64
| amd64
| A 64-bit architecture that is compatible with the x86 architecture. It was first used by AMD (under the AMD64 name) and Intel (under the EM64T name) and is now the most prominent architecture for medium and high-end desktop PCs. It is also commonly found in the server segment. 
| AMD Athlon 64, AMD Opteron, AMD Sempron processors, AMD Phenom, Intel Pentium 4, Intel Pentium Core i3, Intel i5, Intel i7 
|-
| IA64
| ia64
| A 64-bit architecture designed by Intel and used in their Intel Itanium processor series. This architecture is not compatible with x86 or x86_64 (aka amd64) and is mostly found in medium and high-end server series. 
| Intel Itanium
|-
| Sparc
| sparc
| The SPARC architecture is best known by its most common producers, Sun (now Oracle) and Fujitsu. It is used in server systems although a few workstations exist as well. In Gentoo, only SPARC64 compatible CPUs are supported. 
| E3000, Blade 1000, Ultra 2
|-
| PowerPC
| ppc
| A 32-bit architecture used by many Apple, IBM and Motorola processors. They are most commonly found in embedded systems.
| Apple OldWorld, Apple NewWorld, generi Pegasos, Efika, older IBM iSeries and pSeries 
|-
| PowerPC 64
| ppc64
| The 64-bit variant of the PPC architecture, popular in both embedded as well as high-end performance servers. 
| IBM RS/6000s, IBM pSeries, IBM iSeries
|-
| Alpha
| alpha
| The Alpha architecture is a 64-bit architecture developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It is still in use by some mid-range and high-end servers, but the architecture is slowly being faded out. 
| ES40, AlphaPC, UP1000, Noname 
|-
| PA-RISC
| hppa
| Referred to as HPPA, the PA-RISC architecture is an instruction set developed by Hewlett-Packard and was used in their mid- and high-end server series until about 2008 (after which HP started using Intel Itanium) 
| HP 9000, PA-8600
|-
| MIPS
| mips
| Developed by MIPS Technologies, the MIPS architecture entails multiple subfamilies (called revisions) such as MIPS I, MIPS III, MIPS32, MIPS64 and more. MIPS is most common in embedded systems.
| MIPS32 1074K, R16000
|-
| ARM
| arm
| This 32-bit architecture is a very popular architecture for embedded and small systems. Subarchitectures range from ARMv1 to ARMv7 (Cortex) and are often found in smartphones, tablets, handheld consoles, end-user GPS navigation systems, etc.
| StrongARM, Cortex-M

The majority of Gentoo users use the x86_64 architecture (AMD64).

=== Download the media ===

The default installation media that Gentoo Linux uses are the ''minimal installation CDs'', which host a bootable, very small Gentoo Linux environment with the right tools to install Gentoo Linux from. The CD images themselves can be downloaded from one of the many [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors2.xml mirrors] available.

On those mirrors, the minimal installation CDs can be found as follows:
# Go to the {{Path|releases/}} directory
# Select the right architecture, such as {{Path|amd64/}}
# Select the {{Path|autobuilds/}} directory
# Select the {{Path|current-iso/}} directory

Inside this location, the installation CD file is the file with the {{Path|.iso}} suffix. For instance, take a look at the following listing:
{{Code|Example list of downloadable files at releases/amd64/autobuilds/current-iso/|<pre>
[DIR] hardened/                                          05-Dec-2014 01:42    -

</pre>}}

In the above example, the {{Path|install-amd64-minimal-20141204.iso}} file is the minimal installation CD itself. But as can be seen, other related files exist as well:
* A {{Path|.CONTENTS}} file which is a text file listing all files available on the installation CD. This file can be useful to verify if particular firmware or drivers are available on the installation CD before downloading it.
* A {{Path|.DIGESTS}} file which contains the hash of the ISO file itself, in various hashing formats/algorithms. This file can be used to verify if the downloaded ISO file is corrupt or not.
* A {{Path|.DIGESTS.asc}} file which not only contains the hash of the ISO file (like the {{Path|.DIGESTS}} file, but also a cryptographic signature of that file. This can be used to both verify if the downloaded ISO file is corrupt or not, as well as verify that the download is indeed provided by the Gentoo Infrastructure team and has not been tampered with.

Ignore the other files available at this location for now - those will come back when the installation has proceeded further.

=== Booting the CD ===
To get in the initial Gentoo environment, you need to boot from the installation CD. How to achieve this depends on the architecture you are using. The first appendix in this book covers the various architecture-specific aspects of a Linux system, including booting CDs.

Once booted, you will see that the installation CD already tried to load the necessary drivers and hands you over to a ''root prompt'', indicating that the system is waiting for further input:
{{RootCmd|&nbsp;}}

This is the command-line prompt. You are now booted in the initial Gentoo environment, ready to continue.
