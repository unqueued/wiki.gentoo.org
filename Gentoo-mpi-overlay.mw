=== Description ===
A collection of tools for assisting the build process for MPI software in order to support installations of multiple MPI implementations and their respective versions. This should serve as a set of standards for MPI ebuild writers, and make it as easy as possible to write and maintain MPI ebuilds.

=== mpi-providers.eclass ===
This is to support multiple MPI implementation's installations in parallel. Remove any "SLOT=" assignment from the ebuild, as this is handled by mpi-providers. Append 'sysconfdir="$(mpi-providers_sysconfdir)" ' to your econf arguments. In the install phase, insert "mpi-providers_safe_mv" to the end of the installation function, as this will move the installation destination in such a way to support parallel installs in /usr/lib/mpi.
