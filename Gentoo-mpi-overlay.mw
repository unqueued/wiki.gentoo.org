=== Description ===
The MPI overlay serves as a set of tools and standards used when writing and building MPI software. The goal is to make it easier for users and developers of MPI software to write, build, and maintain their code. The current overlay consists of two eclasses- mpi-providers and mpi-select- which should be used in all MPI ebuilds currently in the Portage tree, and for development in the future.<br />
{|
|-
| '''mpi-providers''' || : Allows for parallel installations of varied versions of a common MPI implementation, all installed to the same parent directory. 
|-
| '''mpi-select''' || :  Enables MPI software to be built against selected MPI implementations at the users' discretion.
|}

=== Prerequisites ===
* Currently the eclasses provided require '''EAPI 5 or 6''' to run.
* Many MPI ebuilds require '''updated gcc with proper fortran USE flags''' in order to build.

=== mpi-providers.eclass ===
This is to support multiple MPI implementation's installations in parallel. Remove any "SLOT=" assignment from the ebuild, as this is handled by mpi-providers. Append 'sysconfdir="$(mpi-providers_sysconfdir)" ' to your econf arguments. In the install phase, insert "mpi-providers_safe_mv" to the end of the installation function, as this will move the installation destination in such a way to support parallel installs in /usr/lib/mpi.

=== mpi-select.eclass ===
This allows other mpi software to be built with multiple MPI implementations. For example, if you want to build HPL with mpich and openmpi, mpi-select will build mpich and openmpi against HPL.
