'''Streamlink''' is a command-line utility that can extract video streams and pipe them into a video player. The main purpose of streamlink, according to the official documentation, is to "allow the user to avoid buggy and CPU heavy flash plugins but still be able to enjoy various streamed content." Streamlink is written in python and works with various media players such as mpv, mplayer, and vlc. 

== Installation ==

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask net-misc/streamlink}}

== Usage ==

Streamlink is a fairly simple program run from the command line with various options:

{{Cmd|streamlink --player <video-player> <stream-url> <stream-quality>}}

* <code><video-player></code> is the desired video player. The default player is '''vlc''' but '''mplayer''' and '''mpv''' are also available.

* <code><stream-url></code> is the location of the desired stream. While the full list of supported plugins is extensive, some popular supported streams are '''bloomberg''', '''mixer''', '''twitch''', and '''youtube'''.

* <code><stream-quality></code> is the desired available quality of the stream. The options allow either a specific quality, such as ''720p'', or a more vague quality such as ''high'' or ''low''. Further, streamlink allows ''best'' or ''worst'' as alternatives.

For example:

{{Cmd|streamlink --player mpv twitch.tv/''name-of-channel'' best}}

Or, alternatively:

{{Cmd|streamlink --player mpv twitch.tv/''name-of-channel'' 720p}}
