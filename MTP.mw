== Prerequisites ==
If your device is not recognized by libmtp, try upgrading to latest (or even git) version.

User needs to be in group '''plugdev''' to mount device.

== MTPFS ==
You need to add option: '''user_allow_other''' in ''/etc/fuse.conf''

$ mkdir ~/AndroidDevice

$ mtpfs -o allow_other ~/AndroidDevice

NOTE: this can take really long time, up to several minutes. As an indication of successful mount the mtpfs will go to background.

To unmount:

$ /usr/bin/fusermount -u ~/AndroidDevice


''If mtpfs doesn't work for you try updating to latest version first.''

== Go-MTPFS ==
Seems to be more stable

$ emerge -a go

$ mkdir ~/go

$ export GOPATH=/home/$USER/go

$ go get github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs


To mount:

$ ~/go/bin/go-mtpfs ~/AndroidDevice


To unmount:

$ /usr/bin/fusermount -u ~/AndroidDevice

== Troubleshooting ==
* Sometimes (e.g. on HTC One X) USB debugging automatically turns on when device is connected to PC. You need to turn debugging off, otherwise libmtp can't recognise device.
* Make sure your Android device is not going to sleep and the screen is not getting locked. Set screen timeout to very long values, or enable in Development section flag "Do not turn off the screen".
