The (U)EFI firmware present in many newer computers can function as [[bootloader]], allowing systems to boot without needing an additional software bootloader. This article shows how to [[#Configuration|configure]] and [[#Installation|install]] an unsigned kernel in the EFI System Partition (ESP) of a computer running in EFI mode with [[wikipedia:secureboot|secureboot]] turned off and how it shares the ESP with another OS for multiboot. 

== Partitioning ==

Create a [[partition]] of type "EFI System partition", which is <code>EF00</code> on GPT and <code>EF</code> on MBR. Using {{C|gdisk}}:

{{RootCmd|gdisk /dev/sda|output=<pre>
Command (? for help): n
Partition number (1-128, default 1): 1
First sector: (enter desired start sector and size, 100 MB should be plenty)
Command (? for help): t
Partition number (1-2): 1
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): EF00
Command (? for help): w
</pre>}}

Create a FAT32 filesystem inside:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sda1}}

If the {{C|mkfs.vfat}} command is not present (part of {{Package|sys-fs/dosfstools}}), the Busybox version can be used instead:

{{RootCmd|busybox mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1}}

{{Note|The {{C|gdisk}} utility comes with the {{Package|sys-apps/gptfdisk}} package.}}

== Kernel ==

=== Configuration ===

In order to boot directly from UEFI, the kernel needs to have these options enabled:

Enable GPT partition label support if that was used previously when partitioning the disk (<var>CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED</var> and <var>CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION</var>):

{{KernelBox|title=Enable support for GPT|1=
-*- Enable the block layer --->
   Partition Types --->
      [*] Advanced partition selection
      [*] EFI GUID Partition support
}}
Enable <var>CONFIG_EFI</var> and <var>CONFIG_EFI_STUB</var> support enabled. It is also a good idea to enable <var>CONFIG_EFI_VARS</var> so that the system firmware can be manipulated via {{c|[[efibootmgr]]}}. <var>CONFIG_EFI_MIXED</var> as proposed by [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Kernel#Architecture_specific_kernel_configuration|Gentoo Handbook]] is not suitable for the EFI boot stub.

{{KernelBox|title=Enable EFI stub support|1=

    [*] EFI runtime service support

    [ ]     EFI mixed-mode support

Firmware Drivers  --->
    EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) Support  --->
        <*> EFI Variable Support via sysfs
}}

UEFI does not pass kernel parameters to the kernel during normal boot, so they must be hard-coded them via <var>CONFIG_CMDLINE</var> values. In order to boot a root partition located at {{Path|/dev/sda2}} input the following text in the kernel configuration:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable built-in kernel parameters|1=
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] Built-in kernel command line
    (root=/dev/sda2)
}}

Using <code>root=PARTUUID=</code> might be preferable. To find out use {{C|blkid}}:

{{Note|The ''partition's'' PARTUUID is distinct from the ''filesystem's'' UUID.}}

{{RootCmd|blkid {{!}} grep sda2|output=<pre style="white-space: pre;">
/dev/sda2: UUID="d1e0c1e0-3a40-42c5-8931-cfa2c7deae32" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="adf55784-15d9-4ca3-bb3f-56de0b35d88d"
</pre>}}

{{KernelBox|title=Enable built-in kernel parameters - alternative using PATUUID|1=
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] Built-in kernel command line
    (root=PARTUUID=adf55784-15d9-4ca3-bb3f-56de0b35d88d)
}}

=== Optional: Initramfs ===

{{Important|It should be noted that EFI stub kernels can '''''not''''' load an initramfs if it is specified in <var>CONFIG_CMDLINE</var>. Check out [[efibootmgr]], <var>CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE</var>, or separate bootloaders like ([[gummiboot]] or [[GRUB2]]) if an initramfs is a must-have.}}

The EFI stub can load an initramfs and pass it to the kernel, but this requires passing a parameter from the EFI bootloader (ie. <code>initrd=\efi\boot\myinitrd.img</code>). This parameter cannot be built into <var>CONFIG_CMDLINE</var> as outlined above. This may defeat the purpose of using EFI stub since many users prefer it as a way to avoid the necessity of a bootloader and/or dealing with {{c|efibootmgr}}.  Another possibility is to embed the initramfs directly into the kernel image. In order to do this:

* Generate the initramfs using a preferred method ([[Genkernel]], [[Dracut]], etc.).
* Ensure the image is not compressed (just a cpio archive). Genkernel and Dracut both have command line switches for this.
* Rename the initramfs with a {{Path|.cpio}} extension, the kernel requires this in order to embed a cpio archive. The kernel image (with the cpio archive within it) will still be compressed as usual.
* Ensure that the initramfs has the correct read-permissions for the user building the kernel. Most users build the kernel as the root user and may skip this step. 
** Be aware that Dracut makes the initramfs image readable only by the root user, so if the kernel was built as any other user adjust its permissions as needed. Failing to do so (and ignoring the kernel build warnings) will result in a kernel with no embedded initramfs which will leave the system potentially unbootable.

{{KernelBox|title=Build in the initramfs CPIO archive|1=
General setup  --->
    [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
    (/boot/initramfs-3.12.21-gentoo-r1.cpio) Initramfs source file(s)
}}

However, if passing an initramfs as a boot parameter is still desired, the only way it can be done is by using {{C|efibootmgr}} ([[GRUB2]] will not work). An external initramfs has some advantages over building the initramfs directly into the kernel (see the kernel help on on the <var>CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE</var> variable for details on its limitations). In fact, both a built-in and external initramfs can be used simultaneously. Create and install the initramfs with Genkernel, Dracut, by hand, etc. Install the kernel as outlined in the Installation section below. Then:

=== Installation ===

Still in the kernel directory, build the kernel and install the modules:

{{RootCmd
|cd /usr/src/linux
|make -jN
|make modules_install
}}

Have the ESP mounted at {{path|/boot}}:

{{RootCmd|mount /dev/sda1 /boot}}

 (tree -L 3 /boot)
 /boot
 └── EFI
     └── Microsoft
         ├── Boot
         └── Recovery
 
 (Here the Microsoft subtree was created by an earlier installation of Windows 10 Creators Update)

Run the install command:

{{RootCmd
|make install 
}}

 (tree -L 3 /boot)
 /boot
 ├── config-4.9.16-gentoo
 ├── EFI
 │   └── Microsoft
 │       ├── Boot
 │       └── Recovery
 ├── System.map-4.9.16-gentoo
 └── vmlinuz-4.9.16-gentoo

Move {{path|vmlinuz}} to the right place adding the {{path|.efi}} suffix and delete the copies of config and System.map:

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /boot/EFI/Gentoo
|mv /boot/vmlinuz-4.9.16-gentoo /boot/EFI/Gentoo/vmlinuz-4.9.16-gentoo.efi
|rm /boot/config-4.9.16-gentoo /boot/System.map-4.9.16-gentoo
}}

 (tree -L 3 /boot)
 /boot
 └── EFI
     ├── Gentoo
     │   └── vmlinuz-4.9.16-gentoo.efi
     └── Microsoft
         ├── Boot
         └── Recovery

Alternatively the fallback directory {{path|/boot/EFI/Boot}} could be used additionally to or instead of {{path|/boot/EFI/Gentoo}}.

Next, tell the UEFI firmware that a boot entry called "Gentoo" is to be created, which has the freshly compiled EFI stub kernel:

{{RootCmd|efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/sda --part 1 --label "Gentoo" --loader '\efi\gentoo\vmlinuz-4.9.16-gentoo.efi'}}

The latest added entry always gets highest boot priority, so it will be default. The available boot entries can be displayed triggering the EFI boot menu on early boot (on Dell laptops using {{key|F12}} ).

In case an (optional) [[#Optional:_Initramfs|initramfs]] is needed, it also needs to be copied to the same place.

{{RootCmd|mv /boot/initramfs-4.9.16-gentoo.img /boot/EFI/Gentoo/initramfs.img
|efibootmgr --create --part 1 --label "Gentoo" --loader '\efi\gentoo\vmlinuz-4.9.16-gentoo.efi' -u initrd{{=}}'\efi\gentoo\initramfs.img'}}

== Adding additional kernels ==

{{Note|In order to modify UEFI boot entries, the system needs to be booted in EFI mode. This means that the EFI stub image or some EFI capable live media must have been booted as described above.}}

Optionally additional kernels can be made known to the UEFI firmware. This is especially useful when wanting to test more kernels or to dual-boot with another operating system. These will be shown in the boot selection prompt, normally after a keyboard hotkey is pressed at the right time during system initialization. If the hotkey combination is unknown, search for official documentation from the computer manufacture. This information is usually not difficult to find.

Ensure that <var>CONFIG_EFI_VARS</var> have been enabled in the kernel, install {{Package|sys-boot/efibootmgr}} and make them known to the UEFI firmware.

{{KernelBox|title=Enable EFI sysfs controls|1=
Firmware Drivers  --->
    <*> EFI Variable Support via sysfs
}}

{{RootCmd
|cp /boot/vmlinuz-3.6.11-gentoo /mnt/EFI/EFI/Boot/vmlinuz.efi
|efibootmgr --create --part 1 --label "Gentoo" --loader '\efi\boot\vmlinuz.efi'
}}
