'''SSH''' ('''Secure SHell''') is an encrypted terminal program that replaces the classic ''telnet'' tool on Unix-like operating systems.

In addition to remote terminal access provided by the main ''ssh'' binary, the SSH suite of programs has grown to include other tools such as ''scp'' (in very common use) and ''sftp'' (less common).

Originally, SSH was not free.  However, today the most popular and de-facto standard version of SSH is [http://www.openbsd.org/ OpenBSD]'s OpenSSH, which comes pre-installed on Gentoo.
