|Port g-octave to use g-sorcery framework|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
g-octave is a generator of ebuilds for octave-forge package, that does everything on its own. We have the g-sorcery framework now, that tries to encapsulate everything needed to create such ebuild generators easily. This project aims to port g-octave to g-sorcery framework, including implement the features that lacks on the framework but are used by g-octave.|
