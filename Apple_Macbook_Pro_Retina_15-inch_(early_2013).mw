== Driver Settings ==

First, in MacOSX, download GfxCardStatus version 2.2.1 (not 2.1 or 2.3+, it need to be 2.2.1) and select integrated graphics. This step is very important as it will allow you disable the nvidia card, allowing the intel one to work. This is the only way to get the intel card to work until vga_switcheroo fixes this.

You have can either use the open source graphics (intel 915 or nouveau) OR the nvidia graphics.

=== Intel and nVidia nouveau ===

If you are going open source, it is strongly advised that you configure both drivers, even if you only plan on using one. This is because Installing both into the kernel allows you to use vga_switcheroo. This will, at the very least, allow you to turn the one you are not using off to save power.

If you had previously used the proprietary nVidia driver, uninstall it.

Follow the setup for both [[Intel]] and [[Nouveau]] on the wiki, compiling both directly into the kernel. Also, set up [http://archive.is/ofeBp vga_switcheroo].

You can use [[Hprofile]] to swap between intel and nouveau configurations seamlessly. Note however that it does not appear possible (at the moment) to switch from nvidia to intel without rebooting into OS X using the latest 3.14 kernel.

TO DO: add hprofile settings.

=== Intel Use cases ===

Use intel when you are going for long durations without AC power. You'll have to boot into OS X and uso gfxCardStatus to force intel graphics, then use vga_switcheroo to power off the nVidia card.

Unfortunately, the intel card does not support multiple displays. If you don't need multiple displays though (you don't have a docking station) the intel card is recommended as it provides better battery life.

=== nVidia use cases ===

Use the nVidia card if you need to use multiple displays. The ZaphodHeads feature can be used, or you can simply use xrandr.

== Proprietary nVidia ==

Setup here is a lot simpler, but the driver support is really sketchy. If you use this, you can't control the backlight, stopping the x server will result in a black screen requiring a reboot, and you won't be able to suspend/resume.

Use kernel 3.9 with nvidia-drivers-319.17. Later kernel versions or graphics card versions don't seem to work. You must add "nomodeset" to your kernel command line.

Basically, just follow the normal instructions for setting up nVidia graphics [[NVidia/nvidia-drivers]], and make sure the open source drivers are disabled. nvidia-xconfig and nvidia-settings can be used to generate your xorg.conf.
