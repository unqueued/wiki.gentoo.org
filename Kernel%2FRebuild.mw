Exit the kernel configuration and rebuild the kernel using the following command:

{{RootCmd|make && make modules_install}}

Do not forget to copy the newly compiled kernel image to the {{Path|/boot}} location. If applicable mount {{Path|/boot}}.

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}
{{RootCmd|make install}}

== Using GRUB2 ==

Update the boot loader configuration prior to rebooting the system. For instance, when using [[GRUB2#Main_configuration_file|GRUB2]], these steps can be done by running the following command:

{{RootCmd|grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

In case of using the [[EFI system partition|EFI Boot Stub]] instead of a [[bootloader]], see [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Kernel#Compiling_and_installing]].

== Using EFI stub kernel ==

Users of [[EFI stub kernel]] follow the procedure in the [[EFI stub kernel#Installation|Installation]] section. 

Remember to reboot for the new kernel configuration to take effect:

{{RootCmd|reboot}}
