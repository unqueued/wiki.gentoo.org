Exit the kernel configuration and rebuild the kernel using the following command:

{{RootCmd|make && make modules_install}}

Do not forget to copy the newly compiled kernel image to the {{Path|/boot}} location. If applicable mount {{Path|/boot}}, and update the boot loader configuration prior to rebooting the system. For instance, when using GRUB2, these steps can be done by running the following commands:

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}
{{RootCmd|make install}}
{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

In case of using EFI instead of grub, see [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Kernel#Compiling_and_installing]].

Remember to reboot for the new kernel configuration to take effect:

{{RootCmd|reboot}}
