Filesystems can be mounted in several ways:

<!--T:16-->
* {{c|[[mount]]}} - The command used to manually mount filesystems. Requires administrative privileges or entries in {{Path|/etc/fstab}}. 
* [[fstab|{{Path|/etc/fstab}}]] - Contains descriptive information about the filesystems the system can mount.
* [[Removable media]] - Mount on file demand.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on file access.
