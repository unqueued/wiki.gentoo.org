'''SquashFS''' is an open source, read only, extremely compressible [[filesystem]]. Like other filesystems SquashFS is capable of de-duplicating the data passed to it, which helps it compress data further. Although not fully necessary to operate correctly, SquashFS is typically used with some kind of union filesystem when used for Live media (LiveUSBs and LiveCDs).

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Activate the following kernel options ''must'' be activated for SquashFS support:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling SquashFS 4.0 support|1=
File systems  --->
   [*] Miscellaneous filesystems  --->
      [*]   SquashFS 4.0 - Squashed file system support
}}

==== Optional SquashFS support ====

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling optional features of SquashFS|1=
File systems  --->
   [*] Miscellaneous filesystems  --->
         File decompression options (Decompress file data into an intermediate buffer)  --->
         Decompressor parallelisation options (Single threaded compression)  --->
      [*]     Squashfs XATTR support
      [*]     Include support for ZLIB compressed file systems
      [*]     Include support for LZ4 compressed file systems
      [*]     Include support for LZO compressed file systems
      [*]     Include support for XZ compressed file systems
      [*]     Use 4K device block size?
      [*]     Additional option for memory-constrained systems
      (3)       Number of fragments cached
}}

=== USE flags ===

Like most filesystems in Linux, the SquashFS filesystem tools come in a separate package. This package is called {{Package|sys-fs/squashfs-tools}}. Set the desired support for the package by adjusting USE flags accordingly.

{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/squashfs-tools}}

=== Emerge ===

After setting flags as desired, update the system so the changes take effect:

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|sys-fs/squashfs-tools}}

== Usage ==

=== Filesystem creation ===

Creation of SquashFS filesystems is performed with the {{c|mksquashfs}} command. To create a SquashFS filesystem of the home directory of a user named Larry, the following command could be used:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|mksquashfs /home/larry /home/larry/home.squashfs}}

Depending on what kernel features were selected for SquashFS support, the output of the {{c|mksquashfs}} command will look something like the following:

{{GenericCmd|
<pre>Parallel mksquashfs: Using 4 processors
Creating 4.0 filesystem on /home/larry/home.squashfs, block size 131072.
[=========================================================================|] 4/4 100%

Exportable Squashfs 4.0 filesystem, gzip compressed, data block size 131072
        compressed data, compressed metadata, compressed fragments, compressed xattrs
        duplicates are removed
Filesystem size 0.82 Kbytes (0.00 Mbytes)
        58.79% of uncompressed filesystem size (1.39 Kbytes)
Inode table size 104 bytes (0.10 Kbytes)
        46.02% of uncompressed inode table size (226 bytes)
Directory table size 96 bytes (0.09 Kbytes)
        77.42% of uncompressed directory table size (124 bytes)
Number of duplicate files found 1
Number of inodes 7
Number of files 5
Number of fragments 1
Number of symbolic links  0
Number of device nodes 0
Number of fifo nodes 0
Number of socket nodes 0
Number of directories 2
Number of ids (unique uids + gids) 1
Number of uids 1
        larry (1001)
Number of gids 1
        larry (1001)
</pre>}}

Notice the command provides an excellent summary of what went into the newly created {{Path|home.squashfs}} file. Information such as filesystem size, inode table, directory table, number of duplicate files, UIDs, and GUIs are easily readable. This information can be very helpful when attempting to gather specific information from the filesystem.

=== Mount ===

To mount a SquashFS, use the {{c|mount}} command's <code>-o loop</code> option with escalated privileges:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $
|mkdir ~/tmp
|mount -o loop ~/home.squashfs ~/tmp
}}

{{Note|If the {{c|mount}} command fails, see the related entry in the troubleshooting section below.}}

Now all the files that are included in {{Path|home.squashfs}} are available under the {{Path|~/tmp}} mount point. List the files in the directory using the <code>-la</code> options to see all the files:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|ls -la ~/tmp|output=<pre>
total 3
drwxr-xr-x 3 larry larry 125 Mar 31 13:51 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 larry larry 130 Mar 31 13:52 ..
-rw------- 1 larry larry  10 Mar 31 13:49 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 larry larry 127 Mar 24 13:19 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 larry larry 193 Mar 24 13:19 .bash_profile
-rw-r--r-- 1 larry larry 551 Mar 24 13:19 .bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 larry larry   0 Mar 31 13:51 home.squashfs
drwx------ 2 larry larry   3 Oct 23 06:52 .ssh
</pre>}}

=== Unmount ===

To unmount the filesystem, use the {{c|umount}} command with escalated privileges:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|sudo umount ~/tmp}}

=== Extract ===

SquashFS files can be extracted using {{c|unsquashfs}}. Supposing the {{Path|~/tmp}} directory and the {{Path|~/home.squashfs}} file have been previously created in the steps above:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|unsquashfs -d tmp/ -f home.squashfs}}

{{Important|
* If a filesystem ''target'' is not specified ({{Path|~/tmp}} is the target in the example above) {{c|unsquashfs}} will create a folder called {{Path|squashfs-root}} in the ''current'' directory and extract the files there.<ref name="pavlovCecchetti2008">Artemiy I. Pavlov, Marco Cecchetti. [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SquashFS-HOWTO/mksqoverview.html The SquashFS tools exposed], [http://www.tldp.org/ The Linux Documentation Project], July 24, 2008. Retrieved on April 8, 2015</ref>
* If a directory exists previous to the {{c|unsquashfs}} command being run, then the <code>-d <directory></code> and <code>-f</code> options must be used in order to force SquashFS extraction to the ''existing'' directory <ref name="pavlovCecchetti2008" />
* When creating extracting to a ''new'' directory, the <code>-f</code> option is not needed.
}}

{{c|unsquashfs}} can be used to extract a specific file in the SquashFS. Again, presuming the {{Path|~/home.squashfs}} file has been previously created in the steps above, the {{Path|.bashrc}} file can be extracted to the {{Path|~/tmp}} directory:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|unsquashfs -d ~/tmp -f ~/home.squashfs -e .bashrc|output=<pre>
Parallel unsquashfs: Using 4 processors
1 inodes (1 blocks) to write

[===========================|] 1/1 100%

created 1 files
created 1 directories
created 0 symlinks
created 0 devices
created 0 fifos
</pre>}}

View the extract file using the {{c|ls}} command:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|ls -la ~/tmp|output=<pre>
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 1 larry larry  14 Mar 31 13:51 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 larry larry 156 Mar 31 14:32 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 larry larry 551 Mar 24 13:19 .bashrc
</pre>}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== mount: only root can use "--options" option ===

This error is should be self-explanatory. Login as the root user or use {{c|[[sudo]]}} to run mount the filesystem with escalated privileges.
