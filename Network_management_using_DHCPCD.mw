This article is about using OpenRC with DHCPCD<ref name=dhcpcd>[[Dhcpcd]]</ref> as network manager. It is based on a posting in Gentoo Forums.<ref>[https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-965190.html Forum thread TIP: Complete network stack without net.* scripts]</ref>

== Setup ==
Have dhcpcd<ref name=dhcpcd /> installed, then add it to the default runlevel and start the service:

{{RootCmd
|rc-update add dhcpcd default
|/etc/init.d/dhcpcd start
}}
<!--
All its configuration goes into {{Path|/etc/dhcpcd.conf}} but for most installations nothing needs to be done there, presumed that most computers nowadays are behind a router or access point providing DHCP. Though <kbd>man 5 dhcpcd.conf</kbd><ref name=manpage>http://roy.marples.name/man/html5/dhcpcd.conf.html</ref> will be helpful in case of advanced configuration demand. -->

== Wireless ==
Dhcpcd comes with a built-in hook for wpa_supplicant, so it is best choice to install this for wireless.  After installation of wpa_supplicant<ref>[[Wpa_supplicant#Emerge]]</ref> restart dhcpcd:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dhcpcd restart}}{{Important|Don't add wpa_supplicant to any runlevel.}}
For any questions or problems with wpa_supplicant see the references.<ref>[[Wpa_supplicant#Configuration]]</ref><ref>[http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/ wpa_supplicant homepage]</ref><ref>See also [[Handbook:Parts/Networking/Wireless]]</ref>  Note that the older versions (â‰¤2.0-r2) of wpa_supplicant need "env wpa_supplicant_driver=nl80211" in {{Path|/etc.dhcpcd.conf}}.<ref>[https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7617004.html#7617004 Forum thread DHCPCD + wpa_supplicant without WEXT]</ref>

== Static IP address ==
In case the network interface card should be configured with a static IP address, type it into the [[Network_management_using_DHCPCD/Dhcpcd-ui#Usage|Graphical User interface]].  Without the [[Network_management_using_DHCPCD/Dhcpcd-ui#Usage|Graphical User interface]], entries can also be manually added<ref>[[Dhcpcd#Static_IP_address]]</ref> to {{Path|/etc/dhcpcd.conf}}.<ref name=manpage>http://roy.marples.name/man/html5/dhcpcd.conf.html</ref>

== Migration from Gentoo net.* scripts ==
In case of migration from Gentoo net.* scripts<ref>[[netifrc]]</ref><ref>[[Handbook:Parts/Networking/Introduction]]</ref> it's essential to remove wpa_supplicant and the net.* scripts from the runlevels.
{{Cmd|rc-config list <nowiki>| grep 'wpa_supplicant\|dhcpcd\|net.'</nowiki>|output=<pre>
  net.wlp8s0                default
  dhcpcd                    default
  wpa_supplicant</pre>}}
Any lines starting with "net." must not have a runlevel assigned.  In this example, it's net.wlp8s0 to be removed.
{{RootCmd|rc-update del net.wlp8s0
|/etc/init.d/wlp8s0 stop}}

Once the network setup works well you might want to completely remove the old Gentoo net.* scripts setup.  So disable the netifrc useflag, re-emerge OpenRC without and unmerge netifrc:
{{RootCmd|echo 'sys-apps/openrc -netifrc' >> /etc/portage/package.use
|emerge --ask --newuse --oneshot sys-apps/openrc
|emerge -C net-misc/netifrc}}

Also the old config files and symlinks can be removed
{{RootCmd|rm /etc/conf.d/net
|rm /etc/init.d/net.*}}
