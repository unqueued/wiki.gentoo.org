The '''Pandaboard''' is an ARMv7 architecture single board computer based on a Texas Instruments OMAP4430 system on chip (SOC) @ 1GHz
A later model, the '''Pandaboard ES''' include an OMAP4460 clocked at 1.2GHz

== Installation ==
Installing Gentoo in the Pandaboard is pretty simple if you're already a Gentoo user. You need to use an SD card, at least of 2 GB.
With a self hosting Gentoo installation this can balloon in size so if a desktop installation is planned a bigger card is recommended. If you are familar with the Gentoo Linux installation process, there is not much different here.

To be able to install Gentoo, you'll need the following:

    An x86/amd64 based PC with Gentoo and an SD card reader on it
    A Pandaboard or Pandaboard ES
    One SD card >= 2 GB
    A network connection

=== Kernel & Bootloader ===

Before we start the installation process, we need to get/build a kernel and a bootloader for the Pandaboard.

The Pandaboard doesn't have a NAND/flash device, so the bootloader (U-Boot) needs to be located on the SD card, along with the kernel.

For building the stuff needed to boot our Pandaboard, we need the following tools emerged on the host system where we're going to build them.

    sys-devel/crossdev - to create a crosscompiler
    dev-embedded/u-boot-tools - to create a kernel image U-Boot can understand
    sys-fs/dosfstools - to create FAT32 filesystems

{{RootCmd
|emerge sys-devel/crossdev dev-embedded/u-boot-tools sys-fs/dosfstools
|crossdev -S armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi
}}

{{Cmd
|wget ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/u-boot-latest.tar.bz2
|tar xjpf u-boot-latest.tar.bz2 && cd u-boot-*
|make ARCH{{=}}arm CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi- omap4_panda_config
|make ARCH{{=}}arm CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi-
}}

For booting the Pandaboard we need a kernel. The vanilla kernel.org isn't as tested as the one used on Ubuntu. TI has decided to provide support to Ubuntu, so we'll make sure we have all the fixes ubuntu gets by using their kernel.
If the following link gives you a 404 not found error, download the latest .tar.gz file from the precise distribution here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4

{{Cmd|wget 'https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/linux-ti-omap4_3.2.0-1412.16.tar.gz'}}

(Extract and change to the directory)
{{Cmd|tar zxvf linux-ti-omap4_3.2.0-1412.16.tar.gz && cd ubuntu-precise}}

The default kernel config for this kernel version is really minimal, and doesn't have support for wifi or accelerated graphics drivers. So i've decided to provide a basic kernel config.

(Download a minimal kconfig)
{{Cmd|wget http://dev.gentoo.org/~armin76/arm/pandaboard/kconfig -O .config}}

(You could run menuconfig after downloading my kconfig if you'd like)

(Replace 9 with the number of cores you have on your computer)
{{Cmd|make -j9 ARCH{{=}}arm CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi- uImage}}

Once it gets built we'll have a kernel image on arch/arm/boot/uImage.

=== SD Card Setup ===

OMAP-based systems need a special setup of the SD card to boot from it. For more information please check this link.

The following script will format your SD card accordingly, creating two partitions. The first partition size is based on the size of the SD card itself, and it's formatted in vfat. The second partition is the free space left on the card after the first partition, and it's formatted in ext4.

{{Cmd|wget http://dev.gentoo.org/~armin76/arm/pandaboard/mkcard.sh}}

(Replace mmcblk0 with the name of the device of your SD card)
{{RootCmd|bash mkcard.sh /dev/mmcblk0}}

Now we'll mount the first partition on the card and copy the needed files (the ones that we built before) to boot our Pandaboard.

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /mnt/p1 ; mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/p1
|cp u-boot-*/MLO /mnt/p1
|cp u-boot-*/u-boot.img /mnt/p1
|cp ubuntu-precise/arch/arm/boot/uImage /mnt/p1
}}

=== Installing Gentoo ===
The installation on this device is a bit different, and therefore easy, as we can't install Gentoo on it by booting an installation environment. For installing Gentoo (and any other distro, really) you need to put the SD card on your PC and prepare there the minimal installation.

What we'll have to do to setup our installation is:

    Extract stage3 to the 2nd partition of the SD card
    Extract portage snapshot (required to emerge things and ntp(see below))
    Setup fstab
    Setup root password
    Configure hostname and networking (optional, but recommended)
    Enable SSH access (optional, but recommended)
    Enable serial console access (optional, but recommended)

Here's some information about the stages.

    Architecture: arm
    Subarchitecture: armv7a
    CHOST: armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi
    Profile: default/linux/arm/10.0

We'll be using the new EABI, also called gnueabi. Also we'll use hardfloat. That is armhf on Debian.

Therefore, we need an armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi stage3 for best performance, available under the releases/arm/autobuilds directory in your favorite mirror. You need to grab an armv7a_hardfp stage3.

Optionally you can also grab a portage snapshot

Mount the second partition of the SD card and extract the stage3 you downloaded.

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /mnt/p2
|mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/p2
}}

(Adjust the tarball name accordingly)
(Extract the stage3 and snapshot, it may take a while)
{{RootCmd
|tar xjpf stage3-armv7a_hardfp-20101118.tar.bz2 -C /mnt/p2
|tar xjpf portage-latest.tar.bz2 -C /mnt/p2/usr
}}

Edit the file to look like this:

{{FileBox|filename=/mnt/p2/etc/fstab|
<pre>

# This is the important part
# NOTE: If your BOOT partition is ReiserFS, add the notail option to opts.
/dev/mmcblk0p1		/boot		vfat		noauto,noatime	1 2
/dev/mmcblk0p2		/		ext4		noatime		0 1

(Remove the following lines as we don't have SWAP, cdrom, or floppy)
/dev/SWAP		none		swap		sw		0 0
/dev/cdrom		/mnt/cdrom	auto		noauto,ro	0 0
#/dev/fd0		/mnt/floppy	auto		noauto		0 0

</pre>
}}

=== Setting a password ===
This is the most important part of the installation. As without the root password we won't be able to login!

For setting the password, we need to be able to run passwd. However that's not possible since our PC can't run ARM binaries. Therefore we need to modify the file that contains the passwords (/etc/shadow) inside the chroot, so we can set a default root password.

(Generate a password)
{{Cmd|openssl passwd -1}}

{{RootCmd|nano -w /mnt/p2/etc/shadow}}

(Replace the first line with the following line)
root:s3cr3t:14698:0:::::
(Replace s3cr3t with the output the openssl command gave you)

(For example, this line makes the password be gentoo)
root:$6$I9Q9AyTL$Z76H7wD8mT9JAyrp/vaYyFwyA5wRVN0tze8pvM.MqScC7BBm2PU7pLL0h5nSxueqUpYAlZTox4Ag2Dp5vchjJ0:14698:0:::::

=== Network configuration ===

Please read the network configuration chapter of the ARM handbook TODO? to configure the network.

=== Clock & Time ===
One of the problems the pandaboard has, is that it doesn't have a battery to save the clock time. To mitigate this, on Gentoo we have an option in our init system called swclock which sets the date of the system upon boot from a last modified date of a file.

{{RootCmd|ln -sf /etc/init.d/swclock /mnt/p2/etc/runlevels/boot

We remove hwclock from the startup because it sets the date from the RTC, which is 2000-01-01 upon startup and overrides swclock's date.

{{RootCmd|rm /mnt/p2/etc/runlevels/boot/hwclock}}

swclock uses the /lib/rc/cache/shutdowntime's modification time to set the date, therefore we update it to have the current date and time.

{{RootCmd|touch /mnt/p2/lib/rc/cache/shutdowntime}}

Although this doesn't fix the issue, at least helps to set a sane date and time.
Consider using NTP, documented on the next chapter

=== SSH access ===

We can add sshd to the startup of our system so we can access our Pandaboard using ssh.

{{RootCmd|ln -sf /etc/init.d/sshd /mnt/p2/etc/runlevels/default}}

=== Serial terminal ===
By default the ttyS0 port is configured at 9600 bps. However, almost all of the ARM devices run the serial port at 115200 bps. Also, in the case of the Pandaboard, the port is ttyO2 instead of the normal ttyS0. So this should be added to the /etc/inittab file:

{{RootCmd|nano -w /mnt/p2/etc/inittab}}

(Replace 9600 with 115200 on the ttyS0 line, and replace ttyS0 with ttyO2)
s0:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 115200 ttyO2 vt100

=== Finishing up ===
Let's unmount the SD card

(May take a while depending the speed of your SD card)
{{RootCmd|umount /mnt/p1 /mnt/p2}}

== Post Installation ==

This is pretty much all of the installation. I'd highly recommend that you read all the recommendations of the handbook.

Once you have the card ready, put it into the Pandaboard... and you should be able to boot it.

One of the problems of the Pandaboard is that it doesn't save the date because it doesn't have a battery for the clock.

After logging into our new Gentoo on Pandaboard installation, I'd recommend setting a date and emerging net-misc/ntp to keep the clock up-to-date. Also it's recommended to put both ntp-client and ntpd to boot on startup, so you get a proper date setup.

However, keep in mind that NTP requires a network connection and a NTP server being reachable, either on the local network or on the Internet.

(emerge ntp, start both ntp-client and ntpd and add them to the default runlevel on booting)
{{RootCmd
|emerge net-misc/ntp
|rc-update add ntpd default
|rc-update add ntp-client default
|/etc/init.d/ntp-client start
|/etc/init.d/ntpd start
}}

The Pandaboard has integrated hardware that needs either a driver, firmware or tools to work. Making work such hardware is documented on the following page
