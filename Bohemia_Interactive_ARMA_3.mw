(Since I have an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670, I've yet to been able to unmask the =media-libs/mesa-11 dependency due to all of the other unmasked dependencies.  As such, my work temporarily ceases at this point.  See below Troubleshooting for possible errors pointing to this Mesa dependency.) 

AMD: Reported to supposedly just work?

== Common Startup Parameters ==
