== About ==
Experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox. Deploying a wide variety of single- and multiplayer content, over 20 vehicles and 40 weapons, and limitless opportunities for content creation, this is the PCâ€™s premier military game. Authentic, diverse, open - Arma 3 sends you to war.

== Package Requirements ==
=== Install Steam ===
Install steam using "emerge games-util/steam-meta", or following the appropriate Gentoo Wiki for installing the Steam client.

=== Install ARMA 3 ===
Once you have Steam installed and have either created or logged into your existing account, search for the ARMA 3 game clicking "Games" > "View Games Library" > "SteamOS + Linux" or if you haven't purchased the game, then purchase the game clicking "STORE" just below the top menu bar.  The initial download requires 9-12 hours using DSL.

=== GPU Driver Requirements ===
ARMA 3 requires OpenGL 4, and doesn't appear to be GPU bound due to the various driver implementations.

NVIDIA: "Mesa 11 + latest llvm (maybe even 3.7) should give you opengl 4.1, IIRC."  (Since I have an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670, I've yet to been able to unmask the =media-libs/mesa-11 dependency due to all of the other unmasked dependencies.  As such, my work temporarily ceases at this point.  See below Troubleshooting for possible errors pointing to this Mesa dependency.) 

AMD: Reported to supposedly just work?

== Common Startup Parameters ==
* "-noLogs -nosplash -world=empty -skipIntro"
* "-window"
* "-winxp"

== Troubleshooting ==
* Errors lacking Mesa 11 Version requisite providing OpenGL 4 support: "Game wants to disable DXGI reacting to ...", "Can't use Threading Building Blocks with Static Runtimes ...", ...  The following was posted at "M@yeulC commented on 31 August 2015 at 9:15 pm UTC" via "http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/arma-3-available-for-linux-in-a-beta.5890/page=4#comments"; "The game requires GL4.1 minimum so I was not able to run tests on Mesa; Mesa 11 + latest llvm (maybe even 3.7) should give you opengl 4.1, IIRC."

The above error may also be corrected by adding "media-libs/libsdl2 abi_x86_32" to /etc/portage/package.use.  (See http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=25396)  NOTE: Adding the initial media-libs/libsdl (AKA libsdl-1) pulls in a few more dependencies or USE flag augmentations.  So easier just to omit a libsdl-1 32 bit build unless it's really needed.
