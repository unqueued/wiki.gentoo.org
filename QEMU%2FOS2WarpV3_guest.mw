==QEMU with OS/2 Warp V3 as guest==
===Basic install and audio===
====Preparation====
OS/2 Warp V3 has no support for booting from cdrom, so first you have to mount the cdrom and copy disk0.dsk and disk1_cd.dsk from the CD.
Have a look at cdinst.bat to get the location.
These 2 files are floppy images and can be used this way with qemu.
Correct the rights of the floppies, copy your CD after unmounting and create hda.img:

{{RootCmd
|chmod 644 disk*
|dd if{{=}}/dev/sr0 of{{=}}os2v3_cd.iso
|qemu-img create hda.img 1000M
}}

====Installation====
Start qemu with

{{RootCmd
|qemu-system-i386 -fda disk0.dsk -hda hda.img -cdrom os2v3_cd.iso -boot ac
}}

When you are prompted to insert another disk, switch to the console with <ctrl><alt>2 
and type

<pre>
change floppy0 disk1_cd.dsk
</pre>

You can use tab completition, you can get already typed lines with <key up>, it behaves quite like a normal shell.
Go to the emulation screen with <ctrl><alt>1 and hit enter to proceed.
Install (consult your os2 installation manual :-)
When you are prompted to remove the diskette, goto the console and type

<pre>
boot_set c
</pre>

Change back to the emulaten. Make sure that it says '''Press ctrl-alt to exit mouse grab'''
on the window title and then hit <ctrl><alt><delete>

If you ran into a trap while booting, type 

<pre>
system_reset
</pre>

into the console window.

In the system configuration after the first harddisk boot:
To make sure, that you don't loose your cdrom, choose ''not listed ide cdrom''
In multimedia, choose ''Sound Blaster 16'', verify that it says in its configuration:
dma8:1, dma16:5, irg:5, BaseIO:220, MPU-401:330

If you are prompted to push the ok button to reboot and it does not work, just push cancel and do a normal shutdown (right click on the desktop). Go to the console, type q to quit qemu. Fire it up once again, but this time with

<pre>
qemu-system-i386 -fda disk0.dsk -hda hda.img -cdrom os2v3_cd.iso -boot c -device sb16,iobase=220,irq=5,dma=1,dma16=5
</pre>

(one line). Now you should have wave sound. I could not get the midi sound to work. If you know how to do it, just write it down here.
You can create an account by supplying a free choosen name and a password.

If you want to insert another CD, just type

<pre>
change ide1-cd0 image.iso
</pre>

in the console window. 

One note about audio: this makes os2 freeze a lot. This can happen by viewing the Videos from the bonuspak, by pressing backspace, when you already reached the beginning of a line ...

===Install video driver===
====Software====
* xrgw040
* diunpack.exe from fastkick141.zip
* csg144.exe
* gradd97.zip

Resolution is given in an other way as you are used to it on gentoo. 640x480x16 means 16 colors, not 16 Bit color.
To get other video resolution than 640x480x16, you have to do more work. I use the driver in gradd97.zip, but this needs at least fixpack  35 to be installed. Get yourself an appropriate one, for me it is xrgw040 (g is for Germany, US version is xr_w040).

To install a fixpax, you need a so called "Corrective Service" program. This fixpack needs at least version 1.43, so I downloaded csg144.exe (again g for Germany). And because i could not use loaddskf.exe to put the disk images on a diskkette, and the images could not be used by qemu neither, i needed the program diunpack.exe, which i found in fastkick141.zip. Links are not listed, because most links regarding OS/2 were dead. So it is better to search these by name on the web.

====Installation of the fixpack====
After you got everything, put it in a folder, unzip the zipped files and make an iso file with mkisofs.
Insert this iso in qemu, copy the xrgw040 folder to c: and put diunpack.exe in that folder. Now create a folder ''fixpack'' on C:. Open a OS/2 Window, goto c:\xrgw040 and type in

<pre>
diunpack xrgw040.1dk -d c:\fixpack
</pre>

Repeat this for all the other xrgw040.?dk files. Copy csg144.exe to another folder, extract it by double klicking it, and copy the content to c:\fixpack. Find the file response.wp3 and replace the line ''':SOURCE A:\''' with ''':SOURCE c:\fixpack'''.Close all programms except your OS2 Window. Change in it to c:\fixpack an type in

<pre>
fpinst warp3
</pre>

====Installation of the video driver====
After the following reboot, you can install the driver in the gradd97 folder with

<pre>
set lang=de_DE
setup gen
</pre>

Another reboot and you can choose a different resolution like 1024x768x16,7Mio
