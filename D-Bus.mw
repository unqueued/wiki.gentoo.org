'''D-Bus''' is [[Article description::an interprocess communication (IPC) system for software applications]]. Software makes use of D-Bus to communicate between services.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

Portage knows the global <code>dbus</code> USE flag for enabling support for D-Bus in other packages. Enabling this flag will pull in {{Package|sys-apps/dbus}} automatically. This is the default for ''desktop'' [[Profile (Portage)|profile]]s:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Enabling D-Bus globally|lang=bash|1=
USE="dbus"
}}

{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/dbus}}

=== Emerge ===

After setting at least the <code>dbus</code> global USE flag be sure update the system using <code>--changed-use</code> option so Portage will be sure to notice the changes:

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

The main configuration files include:

* {{Path|/usr/share/dbus-1/system.conf}} for the system bus
* {{Path|/usr/share/dbus-1/session.conf}} for the session bus

=== Services ===

==== OpenRC ====

After configuration step, start D-Bus with:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus start}}

To start D-Bus at boot time, add it the default run level:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add dbus default}}

{{Tip|Even without adding D-Bus to the default runlevel it often will get started by D-Bus dependent services. This should explain why D-Bus mysteriously gets started even though it has not been added formally added to a system runlevel.}}

== Usage ==

Some useful commands include:

* {{c|dbus-monitor --system}} - To monitor the activities in the system bus.
* {{c|dbus-monitor --session}} - To monitor the activities in the session bus.
* {{c|dbus-send <PARAMETER>}} - To send a message. See the dbus-send [[man page]] ({{c|man dbus-send}}) for more information.

== Troubleshooting ==

Use the {{c|dbus-monitor}} command to monitor the buses. Errors are also redirected to the syslog ({{Path|/var/log/messages}}).
