'''Weston''' is [[Article description::a reference implementation of a [[Wayland compositor]].]] It is part of the Wayland project and can run as an [[X]] client or under Linux Kernel Mode Setting (KMS).

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=dev-libs/weston}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|dev-libs/weston}}

== Usage ==

The Weston compositor is a minimal and fast compositor and is suitable for many embedded and mobile use cases.

Enable the <code>examples</code> USE flag for building example applications like {{c|weston-image}} or {{c|weston-view}}.

Weston is configured on a local level with the {{Path|~/.config/weston.ini}} file (cf. {{highlight|{{c|man 5 weston.ini}}}}).

{{Note|Follow the instructions below if your environment does not define <var>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</var>. Weston creates its unix socket file in the directory specified by this environment variable and clients use the same variable to find that socket. <ref>https://wayland.freedesktop.org/building.html</ref>}}

The ''environment variable'' can be defined in the usual configuration files. For example, if {{U|Larry}} sets <var>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</var> variable in his [[Bash]] shell's configuration file and he has chosen that the directory will be in {{Path|/tmp}}.

{{FileBox|title=Set <var>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</var>|filename=/home/larry/.bash_profile|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/bash
if test -z "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/${UID}-runtime-dir
    if ! test -d "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
        mkdir "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
        chmod 0700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
    fi
fi
}} 

To launch the compositor as a standalone display server, either enable systemd session support for weston-launch (by using systemd and having the systemd-login devel headers at configure time), or add the user to the "weston-launch" group:

{{RootCmd
|groupadd weston-launch
|usermod -a -G weston-launch $USER
}}

Log all the way out of X, then:

{{RootCmd
|chown root /usr/bin/weston-launch
|chmod +s /usr/bin/weston-launch
}}

Launch Weston with the DRM backend on a VT (outside of X):

{{Cmd|weston-launch}}

Launch Weston with the DRM backend and XWayland support:

{{Cmd|weston-launch -- --modules{{=}}xwayland.so}}

Launch Weston (wayland-1) nested in another Weston instance (wayland-0):

{{Cmd|WAYLAND_DISPLAY{{=}}wayland-0 weston -Swayland-1 }}

From an X terminal, launch Weston with the x11 backend:

{{Cmd|weston}}
