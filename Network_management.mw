This article lists network management software to establish and manage network connections.

== Available software ==

Here are some network packages, along with their capabilities, that are available in Gentoo:

{{Note|The solutions listed as "All-in-one" usually make use of other software listed bellow, e.g. wpa_supplicant.}}

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|+ Gentoo provides several tools for managing your network connections, see [[Network_management/OpenRC_message|Message from openrc-0.12.4]].

== Installation ==

Network connectivity is needed in order to begin to manage networks. On most systems, connectivity will come through a wired or wireless network using a Network Interface Controller (NIC). Hundreds if not thousands of NICs are supported in Linux. All NICs require a kernel driver in order to talk to the Linux kernel. Some NICs, especially wireless NICs, require firmware in order to operate properly.

=== Kernel ===

Kernel support for wired (ethernet) network interfaces can be found under the following menuconfig path:

{{KernelBox|title=Wired network interfaces|1=
Device Drivers  --->
   [*] Network device support  ---> 
      [*]   Ethernet driver support  --->
}}

Kernel support for wireless ([[wifi]]) network interfaces can be found under this menuconfig path:

{{KernelBox|title=Wireless network interfaces|1=
Device Drivers  --->
   [*] Network device support  ---> 
      [*]   Wireless LAN  --->
}}

See the [[Kernel/Configuration|kernel configuration]] article for information on how to manually configure the kernel.

=== Firmware ===

If required by the hardware, install the {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} package:

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}

See the [[Linux firmware]] article for more information on Linux firmware.

== Configuration ==

=== Manual ===

The following commands can be used to configure network interfaces:

* {{c|ip}}
* {{c|ifconfig}} (deprecated)

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Which network interfaces are on the computer? ===

{{:Sysfs/network devices/en}}

* How to find out (lspci, lshw)?
* What are those in {{Path|/sys/devices/virtual/net/}} ?

=== Persistent/Predictable interface naming ===

{{:Eudev/Network device names/en}}
