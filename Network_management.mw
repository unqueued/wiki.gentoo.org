This article [[Article description::lists network management software to establish and manage network connections.]]

Gentoo provides several tools for managing network connections. If you have emerged OpenRc without network support, i.e. with both USE flags [https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/netifrc <code>netifrc</code>] and [https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/newnet <code>newnet</code>] disabled, you might need to set up a network manager such as [[netifrc|net-misc/netifrc]], [[Network_management_using_DHCPCD|net-misc/dhcpcd]], [[Wicd|net-misc/wicd]], [[NetworkManager|net-misc/networkmanager]], or {{Package|net-misc/badvpn}}. Or, you have the option of emerging openrc with the [https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/newnet <code>newnet</code>] use flag and configuring {{Path|/etc/conf.d/network}} and {{Path|/etc/conf.d/staticroute}} if you only use static interfaces.<ref>[https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/plain/sys-apps/openrc/openrc-9999.ebuild sys-apps/openrc-9999.ebuild]</ref>

{{Important|The solutions listed here typically do not work together. Be sure only one of these services is running at a time. Starting more than one network management service '''will lead to unpredictable results'''!}}

The easiest [[Network_management_using_DHCPCD|to use is dhcpcd]]. It has perfect integration for [[wpa_supplicant]] and automatically switches between wired and wireless connections.  In case of using [[Network_management_using_DHCPCD|dhcpcd as network manager]], the USE flags netifrc and newnet may be deactivated in OpenRC.

Gentoo's standard however for network management is using [[Handbook:X86/Networking/Introduction|Gentoo net.* scripts]] aka [[netifrc]].

Here are some network packages, along with their capabilities, that are available in Gentoo:

== Installation ==

Network connectivity is needed in order to begin to manage networks. On most systems, connectivity will come through a wired or wireless network using a Network Interface Controller (NIC). Hundreds if not thousands of NICs are supported in Linux. All NICs require a kernel driver in order to talk to the Linux kernel. Some NICs, especially wireless NICs, require firmware in order to operate properly.

=== Kernel ===

Kernel support for wired (ethernet) network interfaces can be found under the following menuconfig path:

{{KernelBox|title=Wired network interfaces|1=
Device Drivers  --->
   [*] Network device support  ---> 
      [*]   Ethernet driver support  --->
}}

Kernel support for wireless ([[wifi]]) network interfaces can be found under this menuconfig path:

{{KernelBox|title=Wireless network interfaces|1=
Device Drivers  --->
   [*] Network device support  ---> 
      [*]   Wireless LAN  --->
}}

See the [[Kernel/Configuration|kernel configuration]] article for information on how to manually configure the kernel.

=== Firmware ===

If required by the hardware, install the {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} package:

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}

== Configuration ==

=== Manual ===

The following commands can be used to configure network interfaces:

* {{c|ip}}
* {{c|ifconfig}} (deprecated)

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Which network interfaces are on the computer? ===

{{:Sysfs/network devices/en}}

* How to find out (lspci, lshw)?
* What are those in {{Path|/sys/devices/virtual/net/}} ?

=== Persistent/Predictable interface naming ===
