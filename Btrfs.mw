'''Brtfs''' is a new copy on write (CoW) [[filesystem]] for Linux aimed at implementing advanced features while focusing on fault tolerance, repair and easy administration. Jointly developed at Oracle, Red Hat, Fujitsu, Intel, SUSE, STRATO and many others, Btrfs is licensed under the [[GPL]] and open for contribution from anyone.

== Installation ==
=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel option:
{{Kernel||<pre>
File systems  --->
    <*> Btrfs filesystem
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
The package {{Package|sys-fs/btrfs-progs}} contains the utilities to work with the filesystem.

== Usage ==
=== Creation ===
{{Warning|The <code>mkfs.btrfs</code> command irreversibly destroys any content of the partition it is told to format. Please be sure to select the right partition.}}

To create an btrfs filesystem on the {{Path|/dev/sda1}} partition:
{{RootCmd|mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda1}}
Please replace {{Path|/dev/sda1}} with the actual partition you want to format.

=== Mount ===
You can mount the filesystems in several ways:
* [[mount]] - Manual mount.
* [[fstab]] - Automatic mount at boot time.
* [[removable media]] - Automatic mount at demand.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on access.
