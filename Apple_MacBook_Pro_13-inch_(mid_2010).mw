Apple's Mid 2010 MacBook Pro is capable of installing and running Gentoo Linux; especially when a guide is available.

__TOC__

== Installation media ==
This computer is capable of an EFI only install. This is made possible via booking from EFI media. SystemRescueCD should do the trick.  Some users have reported rEFInd was needed to get EFI working properly, however this did not appear to be the case for this system. It should be able to boot off of EFI enabled medium.

To boot to a LiveCD or LiveDVD put the disk into the DVD drive and reboot the system. Press and hold the {{Key|option}} ({{Key|alt}}) key at the beginning of the boot process (before the sound plays). Continue holding the key until a mouse pointer appears. The DVD drive should be making some noises. Eventually (around a minute) two boot options should appear. Select the DVD drive.

{{Note|When using SystemRescueCD, if a black GRUB2 screen appears then the system is booting via EFI firmware. If a blue screen appears SysLinux screen appears, then it is not booting via EFI and the system will be unable to load <code>efivars</code> into the kernel.}}

For further installation instructions see the [[Handbook:AMD64|AMD64 Handbook]]. Refer to some of the configuration instructions in the lower sections of this article for help with specific device setup and kernel configuration.

== Kernel configuration ==
Configuring the kernel for most recent MacBook systems is relatively simple. The specific kernel options can be viewed on the MacBook Pro Retina {{Apple_Macbook_Pro_Retina#Kernel_Configuration|Kernel Configuration]] article.

=== Wireless Drivers ===
See the [[Apple_Macbook_Pro_Retina#Wireless_Drivers|wireless driver section]] from the MacBook Pro Retina for wireless driver configuration.
