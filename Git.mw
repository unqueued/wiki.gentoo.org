'''git''' distributed revision control and source code management. The goal of this article is to easily get a git repository up and running pushing and pulling, and making the installed version of git comparable with (the majority of) http://git-scm.com/book/en/ .


== Background ==

Git is a source code management (SCM) system.  It was developed by Linus Torvalds for use on the Linux Kernel, and other Open Source projects.  According to a talk he gave for Google, he was searching for an SCM and used three criteria which brought the number of adequate systems to zero:

# Must be distributed. 
# Must be fast. 
# What you get out MUST BE EXACTLY what you put in, or you get an error. 

Since there were no satisfactory options, he wrote Git.

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|dev-vcs/git}}:
{{Emerge|git}}

== Configuration ==


=== Local ===
''Someone familiar with using git for local folder management, please complete this section''


=== Server ===
In this section will cover setting up a git server for remote project management through SSH.

'''Note:''' The git server is only necessary if you intend to have an ''unauthenticated read-only server'' for people to get your code from.  See here:
http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon

If you're not sure, then skip this section.

==== Initial Setup ====

Start by creating the needed group, user, and home directory.
The user uses the git-shell to prevent normal shell access.
{{RootCmd
|groupadd git
|useradd -m -g git -d /var/git -s /usr/bin/git-shell git}}


Edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/git-daemon}} to change user from ''"nobody"'' to ''"git"'' and start the daemon.
{{File|/etc/conf.d/git-daemon||<pre>
...
GIT_USER="git"
GIT_GROUP="git"
...
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/git-daemon start}}

==== SSH Keys ====
[[SSH]] is the prefered method to handle the secure communications between client and server.
For Git to work properly, you must have private/public key logins enabled and all client public keys added to {{Path|/var/git/.ssh/authorized_keys}}.
For more information and instructions on how to enable, create, and share keys, please see the [[SSH#Passwordless_Authentication|SSH - Passwordless Authentication]] wiki page.
{{Note|'''this step must be completed before continuing'''}}


==== Usage ====


===== Create a Repository and make the First Commit =====
'''On the server:'''

Become user git to make sure all objects are owned by this user

{{RootCmd|su git}}

Create a bare repository

{{Cmd
|cd /var/git
|mkdir /var/git/newproject.git
|cd /var/git/newproject.git
|git init --bare}}


'''On a the client station:'''
{{Cmd
|mkdir ~/newproject
|cd ~/newproject
|git init
|touch test
|git add test
|git config --global user.email "dev@example.com"
|git config --global user.name "dev"
|git commit -m 'initial commit'
|git remote add origin git@example.com:newproject.git
|git push origin master}}

== Common Commands ==

'''Clone a repository:'''
{{Cmd|git clone git@example.com:newproject.git}}
