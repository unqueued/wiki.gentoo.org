'''git''' distributed revision control and source code management.  the goal of this wiki is to easily get a git repository up and running pushing and pulling, and making the installed version of git compatable with (the majority of) http://git-scm.com/book/en/

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|dev-vcs/git}}:
{{Emerge|git}}

== Configuration ==


=== ssh ===

this file has control over the server settings and locations of keys and directories.

{{File|/etc/sshd_config||<pre>
# uncomment me to enable my magic powers
</pre>
}}

ssh is a must for remote management.

you need to set up passwordless logins by keys.

=== Initial Setup ===

{{RootCmd|groupadd git && useradd -g git}}
{{RootCmd|mkdir /home/git}}
{{RootCmd|ln -s /home/git /opt/git}}
{{RootCmd|chown git.git /home/git}}
temporarily edit /etc/conf.d/git-daemon to change user from nobody to git in the config.
{{RootCmd| su git}}
{{Cmd|cd ~}}
{{Cmd|mkdir /home/git/test.git}}
{{Cmd|cd /home/git/test.git}}
{{Cmd|git init --bare}}


and now your goodies are located at git@localhost:test.git but you must access the repo from an external machine, so replace localhost with your git servers ip

???

== Usage ==
for git://

{{Cmd|git clone git://localhost/test.git test.git}}

last test.git is what the remote machine writes in its current working directory.

for ssh://

for http://

PROFIT!!!
