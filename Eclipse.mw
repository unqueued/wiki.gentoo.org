= Eclipse SDK =
Eclipse is a software development platform including frontends for atypically Java development software tools, however a C/C++ frontend can also be optionally installed and is called CDT.  The installation of CDT is further discussed below.

= Install Java Overlay =
Install the java overlay, using layman.

{{RootCmd|layman -a java}}
{{RootCmd|eix-update -a java}}

= Install Eclipse SDK =
{{RootCmd|emerge -q dev-util/eclipse-sdk-bin}}

= Run Eclipse =
To run eclipse, simply type the following replacing with the version number installed.
{{Cmd|/usr/bin/eclipse-bin-4.2}}

= Install CDT =
CDT adds C/C++ tools to Eclipse SDK.

Need to first find the latest code name for the latest release of CDT.  Go to the following page and take note of the latest code named release.  (ie. kepler, indigo, juno, ...)

http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php

== Install Update Repository ==
Go to "Help > Install New Software" and add the following repository after clicking add, and after finding and replacing "kepler" with the latest code named repository.

*Kepler Updates
*http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler

This general repository is needed prior trying to add the CDT repository, as the CDT repository depends on other packages outside of the CDT repository and which were not installed by default.

== Install CDT Repository ==
Go to "Help > Install New Software" and click 'add', adding the following after also replacing the code name with the latest code named repository.

*CDT 8.2.1 for Eclipse Kepler
*http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/kepler

Once this repository is entered, go ahead and select it and select all or some of the packages and click next.  Eclipse may need to restart afterwards.

= Problems =
=="bundle org.eclipse.rse.ui ... could not be found" or "missing remote debug launcher"==

You need to install the general Update Software repository mentioned above prior to installing CDT in order to satisfy these dependencies.  Eclipse SDK should then automatically pull them in.

=="Random crashes happening in native code (C  [libgobject-2.0.so.0+0x1b0b8]  g_object_get_qdata+0x18)"==

Workaround: Set the gtk+-2 theme to default. You can limit this to eclipse-sdk:
{{Cmd|GTK2_RC_FILES{{=}}/usr/share/themes/Default/gtk-2.0/gtkrc eclipse-sdk}}
