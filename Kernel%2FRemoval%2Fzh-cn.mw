这篇文章描述如何移除旧的[[kernel]]。

== 移除内核源代码 ==

在安装新的内核并正常工作之后，旧的内核就可以移除了。emerge的"--depclean"选项（缩写为"-c"）可以用来移除所有旧的或者不用的软件版本，例如{{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}。

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|gentoo-sources}}

请确定不要移除正在运行的内核（关于如何升级请参考文章[[Kernel/Upgrade|内核升级]]）。

=== Protecting kernel sources ===

If newer kernel sources has been merged and you run ''--depclean'' before switching to the newer sources, the current sources will be removed. But if you want to stay with the current sources, this removal is not wanted, because you may need the sources e.g. for updating external kernel modules. It's therefore good practice to add the specific kernel version to your world file to protect it from ''--depclean'' operations.

{{Emerge|params+=--noreplace|gentoo-sources:3.3.8}}

Note the slot notation, using a colon instead of a dash. Every kernel version is its own slot.

== Remove kernel leftovers ==

=== Using eclean-kernel ===

{{Package|app-admin/eclean-kernel}} is a simple tool for old kernel cleanup/removal. It removes both built kernel files and build directories if they're no longer reference by any preserved kernel.

For example, to keep three newest kernels around:

{{RootCmd|eclean-kernel -n 3}}

=== Manual removal ===

Portage however only removes the files it installed - the files generated during the kernel build and installation remain. They can be safely removed.

* When a kernel is built in the source directory, files generated during the build process remain, and are not removed by Portage:

: {{RootCmd|rm -r /usr/src/linux-3.X.Y}}

* During kernel setup, the kernel modules are copied to a sub directory of <tt>/lib/modules/</tt>:

: {{RootCmd|rm -r /lib/modules/3.X.Y}}

* The old files in {{Path|/boot}} can also be removed:

: {{RootCmd|rm /boot/kernel-3.X.Y|rm /boot/System.map-3.X.Y|rm /boot/config-3.X.Y}}

* Lastly, remove all leftover entries from your bootloader's config file.
