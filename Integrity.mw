Integrity is a [[Hardened Gentoo|Gentoo Hardened]] subproject aiming for the integration of system integrity technologies within Gentoo.

This project will support the Linux IMA/EVM technology within Gentoo Linux, as well as other integrity-related technologies together with compliance and reporting specific technologies. It will support the necessary kernel patches, utilities and documentation to make integrity checks, compliance and reporting available to the wider public. The primary focus is to prevent tampering of files, settings and images: when this occurs, the boot-up of the system detects the tampering and refuses to load further (or report this to the administrator). Online tampering detection is a second step.

Next to the integrity subsystem within Linux (IMA/EVM), this project will also support the various trusted computing technologies (such as TPM support) through well-documented guides and tools.
