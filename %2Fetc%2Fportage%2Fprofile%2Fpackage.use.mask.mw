The {{Path|/etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask}} file contains per-package USE flag masks.

{{Note|In a cascading profile setup, you can remove USE flags in children profiles which were added by parent profiles by prefixing the flag with a <code>-</code> (minus sign).}}

== Format ==

* Comments begin with <code>#</code> (no inline comments).
* One DEPEND atom per line with space-delimited USE flags.

== Example ==

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask|title=Per-package USE flag masks example|1=
# Mask docs for GTK 2.x
=x11-libs/gtk+-2* doc
# Unmask mysql support for QT
x11-libs/qt -mysql
}}
