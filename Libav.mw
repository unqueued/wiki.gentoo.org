==Introduction==
Libav is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It includes libavcodec - the leading audio/video codec library.

==Software not building with Libav==
Normally some old software might not be ready for the 0.8 or even the 0.7 libav api.
The most outstanding issue are:
* libavutil specific function being used without including the required header
:#include <libavutil/mathematics.h> to include av_rescale_q() is the most common
* FFmpeg only calls used
:avformat_alloc_output_context2() might be the most used, it is a shortcut for calling avformat_alloc_context() followed by using av_guess_format() and an av_strlcpy of the filename.
