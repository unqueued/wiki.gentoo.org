'''Libav''' is [[Article description::a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.]] It includes an implementation of libavcodec â€” the leading audio/video codec library.

== Software not building with Libav ==

Some software might not be compatible with the 0.8 or even the 0.7 Libav API.

The most outstanding issues include:

* libavutil specific function being used without including the required header:
: <code>include <libavutil/mathematics.h></code> to include <code>av_rescale_q()</code>
: <code>include <libavutil/avstring.h></code> to include the <code>av_str</code> functions
* FFmpeg only calls used:
: <code>avformat_alloc_output_context2()</code> might be the most used, it is a shortcut for calling <code>avformat_alloc_context()</code> followed by using <code>av_guess_format()</code> and an <code>av_strlcpy</code> of the filename.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

Some packages know the <code>[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/libav libav]</code> [[USE flag]] for Preferring {{package|media-video/libav}} over {{package|media-video/ffmpeg}} whenever both are supported.

{{USEflag|package=media-video/libav}}

=== Emerge ===

After setting appropriate USE flags, run the {{c|emerge}} command:

{{Emerge|media-video/libav}}

== Usage ==

Libav provides a new command-line tool to manipulate streams called {{c|avconv}}. Its aim is similar to the {{c|ffmpeg}} command from FFmpeg, but the syntax had been changed to be more regular and it aims to solve some long standing issues regarding time stamp guessing/generation that had been a bane for everybody trying to transcode live streams in the past.
