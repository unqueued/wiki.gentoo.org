'''Libav''' is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It includes an implementation of libavcodec â€” the leading audio/video codec library.

== Software not building with Libav ==
Some software might not be compatible with the 0.8 or even the 0.7 Libav API.
The most outstanding issue are:
* libavutil specific function being used without including the required header
: include <libavutil/mathematics.h> to include av_rescale_q()
: include <libavutil/avstring.h> to include the av_str functions
* FFmpeg only calls used
:avformat_alloc_output_context2() might be the most used, it is a shortcut for calling avformat_alloc_context() followed by using av_guess_format() and an av_strlcpy of the filename.

== Installation ==
=== USE flags ===
Due to current limitations on the Wiki, the USE flag list had to be divided into two separate sections.
{{USEflag|package=media-video/libav|desc=Optional USE configuration for {{Package|media-video/libav}}:
|X+yes
|aac+yes
|alsa+yes
|amr
|bindist
|bs2b+++Enable media-libs/libbs2b based Bauer
|bzip2+yes
|cdio
|cpudetection
|custom-cflags++no
|debug++no
|doc
|encode+yes
|faac
|fdk
|fontconfig
|frei0r
|gpl+yes
|gsm
|hardcoded-tables+yes
|ieee1394
|jack
|jpeg2k
|mp3+yes
}}
<!-- The {{USEflag}} template only accepts 31 parameters, which was too many to fit into one list. In this article the list has to be divided into two sections. -->
{{USEflag|package=media-video/libav|desc=Optional USE configuration for {{Package|media-video/libav}} section 2:
|network+yes
|openssl
|opus
|oss
|pic
|pulseaudio
|rtmp
|schroedinger
|sdl+yes
|speex
|ssl+yes
|static-libs++no

|theora

|twolame+++Enable MP2 encoding via media-sound/twolame as an alternative to the internal encoder
|v4l
|vaapi
|vdpau
|vorbis+yes
|vpx
|wavpack
|webp+++Enable WebP encoding with media-libs/libwebp
|x264+yes
|x265+++Enable HEVC encoding with media-libs/x265
|xvid+yes
|zlib+yes
}}

=== Emerge ===
After setting appropriate USE flags, run the <tt>emerge</tt> command:
{{Emerge|libav}}

== Usage ==
Libav provides a new commandline tool to manipulate streams called <tt>avconv</tt>. Its aim is similar to the <tt>ffmpeg</tt> command from FFmpeg, but the syntax had been changed to be more regular and it aims to solve some long standing issues regarding timestamp guessing/generation that had been a bane for everybody trying to transcode live streams in the past.
