<!-- Description goes here: --> 
The Android custom ROM development has been based on cross-compilation and flashing whole partitions.  This paradigm has been serving well for the embedded system developments.  But as the performance of personal mobile devices boost, it becomes feasible and desirable to introduce package management like personal computers.  Package manangement will make software installation and update reliable, reproducible, incremental and convienent.

This project aims to introduce Gentoo's prestiges package manager, portage, to manage Android software stack. Taking the [https://jsteward.moe/gsoc-2018-final-report.html KirenaHoro's work] as the starting point, you are going to develop a framework to drive the AOSP/LineageOS build system into a set of portage ebuilds.
