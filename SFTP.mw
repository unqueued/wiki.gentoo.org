sftp ('''s'''ecure '''f'''ile '''t'''ransfer '''p'''rogram) is an interactive file transfer program, similar to ftp, which performs all operations over an encrypted SSH transport. It uses many features of SSH, such as public key authentication and compression.<ref>http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/sftp.1?query=sftp&sec=1</ref>

== Installation ==
On the majority of Gentoo mediums <tt>sftp</tt> should be already installed. To verify installation run the sftp command. A usage statement should appear:
{{Cmd|sftp|output=<pre>
usage: sftp [-1246aCfpqrv] [-B buffer_size] [-b batchfile] [-c cipher]
          [-D sftp_server_path] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file] [-l limit]
          [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-R num_requests] [-S program]
          [-s subsystem | sftp_server] host
       sftp [user@]host[:file ...]
       sftp [user@]host[:dir[/]]
       sftp -b batchfile [user@]host
</pre>}}

If no usage statement is displayed then <tt>sftp</tt> is not installed or has been corrupted. Follow the installation instructions beginning at [[SSH#USE_flags|the USE flag section in the SSH article]].
