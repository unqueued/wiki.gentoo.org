SFTP ('''S'''ecure '''F'''ile '''T'''ransfer '''P'''rogram) is [[Article description::an interactive file transfer program, similar to ftp, which performs all operations over an encrypted [[SSH]] transport.]] It uses many features of SSH, such as public key authentication and compression.<ref>http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/sftp.1?query=sftp&sec=1</ref>

== Installation ==

On the majority of Gentoo mediums {{c|sftp}} should be already installed. To verify installation run the {{c|sftp}} command. A usage statement should appear:

{{Cmd|sftp|output=<pre>
usage: sftp [-1246aCfpqrv] [-B buffer_size] [-b batchfile] [-c cipher]
          [-D sftp_server_path] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file] [-l limit]
          [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-R num_requests] [-S program]
          [-s subsystem | sftp_server] host
       sftp [user@]host[:file ...]
       sftp [user@]host[:dir[/]]
       sftp -b batchfile [user@]host
</pre>}}

If no usage statement is displayed then {{c|sftp}} is not installed or has been corrupted. Follow the installation instructions beginning at [[SSH#USE_flags|the USE flag section in the SSH article]].
