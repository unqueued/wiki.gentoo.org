The '''{{Path|/usr/portage/profiles}}''' directory contains global [[Profile (Portage)|Gentoo profiles]] that are controlled by the developers. One of them needs to be [[Profile (Portage)#Change profile|selected as the system profile]]. To override these settings, use the files in the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage|/etc/portage/profile/]]}} directory.
