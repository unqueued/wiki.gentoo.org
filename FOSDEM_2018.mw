On Saturday 3rd February and Sunday 4th February 2018, the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting [https://fosdem.org/2018/ FOSDEM 2018] takes place in Brussels, Belgium.

Naturally a Gentoo crowd is there; this page collected public information about our presence and helped with organizing stuff.

== Gentoo stand ==

Gentoo will have a stand at K1A-area (map and info to follow)

The following is an hour-by-hour schedule of who is running the stand. The plan is to have always two devs present, with overlapping two-hour slots (i.e., 10h-12h, 12h-14h, ... and 9h-11h, 11h-13h, 13h-15h, ...) (At start and end there are shorter slots, but these obviously also involve build-up and teardown.)

We'll meet (as every year) for the traditional Gentoo dinner on saturday evening. Details TBA

== Gentoo OpenPGP Web of Trust ==
Gentoo will not host a key signing party this year, but participants are encouraged to exchange and verify OpenPGP key data to build the Gentoo Web of Trust. Please bring printed information of the fingerprint and various UIDs you want certified along with a valid governmental ID matching the UID. You can use a service like [http://openpgp.quelltextlich.at/slip.html] to generate such a key slip.
