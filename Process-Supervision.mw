[[Process-Supervision]] is the ability to manage (long lived) processes or rather ''daemons'' and be able to get (automated) process restart if need be, be it a process crash or signal mis-use.
There are curently four well known implementations using the same API: [[Daemontools]], [[Daemontools-encore]], [[Runit]] and [[S6]].
The two later suites can also be used as [[Comparison of init systems|init]] PID 1 replacement;
Although the latter case, [[S6]] that is, is left to the distribution or Operating System implementation.

== Rationale ==

There is certainly the need of process management and supervision in order to ensure the availability of certains functionalities in the Openrating System.
Without daemontools[-encore], runit and s6 supervision model, this is done with some dirty and less dirty hacks which involve managing PID files of (child) processes to be able to start/stop (child) processes when necessary. Current process management implementation&mdash;start-stop-daemon (''ssd'' for short)&mdash;in OpenRC uses this scheme whith some known flaws like positive false PID aquisition with a kind of racy start up.

This is where enter process supervision which normaly have a direct feedback link with child process.
Well, the daemontools API supervision family start child processes in the foreground,&mdash;instead of the background for ssd implementation,&mdash;for this end with a foreground (hack) utility is used if necessary,&mdash;usualy named ''fghack'',&mdash;to achieve this feast with (''bad'') daemons.

However, the supervision advocates tend to advocate a complete system supervision, meaning that, every daemon in the system is supervised.
Does this really fit well in every use case? Or is it safe to supervise every daemon in every environment? Even in a server oriented one?
Supervision advocates would say ''yes''. And the process supervisor overhead seems to be a non issue because it has small resources foot print.

See the end of the article for an OpenRC supervision backend... still being worked on.

== Supervision Scripts ==
A supervision scripts [https://github.com/tokiclover/supervision-scripts framework] inspired by the original ''supervision-scripts'', see [[#External Ressources]], by Avery Payne is available.
This framework aims to get a KISS supervision suite which work out of the box with an almost empty service directory and log directory: a symlink of ''sv/SERVICE/run'' to ''sv/.opt/run'' and ''sv/SERVICE/log/run'' to ''sv/.opt/run-log'' would be enough for most cases.
Similarly, getty,&mdash;be it agetty, mingetty or fgetty (the latter would require either an edit of the default configuration, or adding a ''sv/SERVICE/OPTIONS'' configuration file)&mdash;work out of the box.

All in all, easy and no environment variable (file) x local (''sv/SERVICE/env'') & global (''sv/.env'') environment directory x (number of) services useless disk seeks! A single ''OPTIONS'' configuration file for each service is prefered here&mdash;with a default (''sv/.opt/SVC_OPTIONS'') configuration file.

OpenRC friendly [[Runit]] ''stage'' 1, 2 and 3 along with a ''ctrlaltdel'' files are available as well, notwithstanding the compatibilty mode offered by setting ''RC_OPTS=Yes'' in ''OPTIONS'' configuration file.
Some [[S6]] experimental stage 1, 2 and 3 are available as well.

Tired to (re-)write the same (''./run'') thing over and over again?! Check this out! Do not want to wear out the (system boot) disk for no good reason?! Try it out!

Finaly, there is an environment variables file ''sv/.opt/SVC_BACKEND'' which contains supervision backend commands and signal that can be used to write a ''generic'' supervisor backend for OpenRC&mdash;''generic'', here, means daemontools family ''generic API'' (runit & s6 included.)
See the following sub-section for more info on an OpenRC supervisor backend.

== OpenRC Supervision Backend ==
There is a [[Runit]] backend for [[OpenRC]] experiment on BGO, see external ressources.
The major blocker issue is starting a service in a race free conditions in a timely manner and be able to report success or failure of said service which does not fit quite well on the ''scan'' service directory (''/service/'') model without races. This is true at least for Runit.
Maybe putting a ''stop'' file in the service directory ''/service/SERVICE/stop'' can help to ''start'' a service in ''down'' state and be able to send a ''start'' or rather ''up'' command.
Still... this has to be tested.
