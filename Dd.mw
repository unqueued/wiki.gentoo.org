''dd'' is used to copy raw data from source to sink, where source and sink can be a block device, file or piped input/output.

== Installation ==
As part of the GNU {{Package|sys-apps/coreutils}}, it should be already installed with any Gentoo GNU/Linux system.

== Usage ==
The program takes input from {{Path|/dev/stdin}}, optional manipulates the data and writes to {{Path|/dev/stdout}} per default.

== Examples ==
Some common tasks where ''dd'' is used

=== Boot-Stick ===
This should work with any live media as long as the memory stick {{Path|/dev/sdX}} is large enough.
{{Warning|any data on the memory stick will be lost}}
{{RootCmd|<nowiki>dd if=/home/myLiveCD.iso of=/dev/sdX -bs=8M</nowiki>}}
: if - defines the source
: of - defines the sink
: bs - ''block size'' - defines the amount of data read/written at a time, default is 512byte but most modern devices can read/write much faster. It is possible to define different sizes for souce and sink using ''-ibs'' and ''-obs''.

=== Backup MBR ===
To backup the MBR partition table, dd can be told to only copy the first 512byte:
{{RootCmd|<nowiki>dd if=/dev/sdX of=/root/mbr.bin -bs=512 count=1</nowiki>}}
: count - is the number of blocks to copy
{{Note|this is the full MBR with partitions layout}}

=== Manipulate input ===
As an example we convert any upper case character in a file to lowercase and reverse the input per line during transfer:
{{Cmd|<nowiki>dd if=/etc/make.conf of=~/make.conf conv=swab,lcase,noerror</nowiki>}}
: conv=swab - this will revert the input per line by swapping any input byte (writing backwards)
: conv=lcase - convert any upper case letter to lower case, the opposite is ''ucase''
: conv=noerror - continue if a read error occurs
