'''dd''' is used to copy raw data from source to sink, where source and sink can be a block device, file or piped input/output.

== Installation ==

As part of the GNU {{Package|sys-apps/coreutils}}, it should be already installed with any Gentoo GNU/Linux system.

== Usage ==

{{c|dd}} takes input from {{c|stdin}}, optionally manipulates the data, and  default writes to {{c|stdout}}.

== Examples ==

Some common tasks where {{c|dd}} is used:

=== Boot stick ===

This should work with any live media as long as the memory stick {{Path|/dev/sdX}} is large enough.
{{Warning|Any data on the memory stick will be lost.}}
{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/home/myLiveCD.iso of{{=}}/dev/sdX bs{{=}}8M}}
<code>if</code>: Defines the source.
<br />
<code>of</code>: Defines the sink.
<br />
<code>bs</code>: Defines the block size (amount of data read/written at a time). The default is 512 bytes but most modern devices can read/write much faster. It is possible to define different sizes for source and sink using <code>ibs</code> and <code>obs</code>.

=== Master boot record backup ===

To backup the master boot record (MBR), copy only the first 512 bytes:
{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/dev/sdX of{{=}}/root/mbr.bin bs{{=}}512 count{{=}}1}}
<code>count</code>: The number of blocks to copy.
{{Note|This is the complete MBR with the partition layout.}}

=== Input manipulation ===

As an example, convert any upper case character in a file to lowercase and reverse the input per line, then pipe the output to {{c|less}} to display the file:
{{Cmd|dd if{{=}}/etc/portage/make.conf conv{{=}}swab,lcase,noerror {{!}} less}}
<code>conv=swab</code>: Revert the input per line by swapping any input byte (writing backwards).
<br />
<code>conv=lcase</code>: Convert any upper case letter to lower case. To convert lower case to upper case use <code>ucase</code>.
<br />
<code>conv=noerror</code>: Continue if a read error occurs.
