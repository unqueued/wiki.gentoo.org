'''dd''' is used to copy raw data from source to sink, where source and sink can be a block device, file or piped input/output.

== Installation ==

As part of the GNU {{Package|sys-apps/coreutils}}, it should be already installed with any Gentoo GNU/Linux system.

== Usage ==

The program takes input from {{Path|/dev/stdin}}, optional manipulates the data and writes to {{Path|/dev/stdout}} per default.

== Examples ==

Some common tasks where <tt>dd</tt> is used:

=== Boot-Stick ===

This should work with any live media as long as the memory stick {{Path|/dev/sdX}} is large enough.
{{Warning|Any data on the memory stick will be lost.}}
{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/home/myLiveCD.iso of{{=}}/dev/sdX bs{{=}}8M}}
* <code>if</code> - defines the source
* <code>of</code> - defines the sink
* <code>bs</code> - ''block size'' - defines the amount of data read/written at a time, default is 512 bytes but most modern devices can read/write much faster. It is possible to define different sizes for source and sink using <code>ibs</code> and <code>obs</code>.

=== Backup MBR ===

To backup the MBR partition table, <tt>dd</tt> can be told to only copy the first 512 bytes:
{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/dev/sdX of{{=}}/root/mbr.bin bs{{=}}512 count{{=}}1}}
* <code>count</code> - is the number of blocks to copy
{{Note|This is the full MBR with partitions layout.}}

=== Manipulate input ===

As an example, convert any upper case character in a file to lowercase and reverse the input per line, then pipe the default stdout to {{Path|/bin/less}} to display the file:
{{Cmd|dd if{{=}}/etc/portage/make.conf conv{{=}}swab,lcase,noerror {{!}} less}}
* <code>conv=swab</code> - this will revert the input per line by swapping any input byte (writing backwards)
* <code>conv=lcase</code> - convert any upper case letter to lower case, the opposite is <code>ucase</code>
* <code>conv=noerror</code> - continue if a read error occurs
