{{c|rc}} is a ancient Plan 9 abbreviation that stands for '''r'''un '''c'''ommands. Eric Raymond's The Jargon File mentions a script of a similar name called rc file. This file contained "startup instructions for an application program (or an entire operating system)".<ref>Eric S. Raymond. http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/rc-file.html Retrieved on June 27th, 2015</ref>

It would seem {{c|rc}} was the basis for modern [[init system|init systems]].
