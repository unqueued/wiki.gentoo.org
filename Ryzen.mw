Ryzen is [[Article description::a multithreaded, high performance processor released by AMD in Q1, 2017. It is the first CPU released based on the [[wikipedia:Zen_(microarchitecture)|Zen microarchitecture]].]] Its goal is to directly compete with Intel's Broadwell-E processor line, primarily the Core i7-6900K.

== Installation ==

=== Firmware ===

Microcode/firmware updates to be determined...

=== Kernel ===

Enable support for Ryzen hardware in kernel 4.11.0:

{{KernelBox|title=Kernel 4.11.0|1=
Processor type and features  --->
  [*] Symmetric multi-processing support
  [*] AMD ACPI2Platform devices support
  Processor family (Opteron/Athlon64/Hammer/K8)  --->
    (X) Opteron/Athlon64/Hammer/K8
  [*] Supported processor vendors  --->
    [*]   Support AMD processors (NEW)
  [*] SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support
  [*] Multi-core scheduler support
  [*] Machine Check / overheating reporting
  [*]   AMD MCE features
  Performance monitoring  --->
    <*> AMD Processor Power Reporting Mechanism
  [*]   AMD microcode loading support
Power management and ACPI options  --->
  CPU Frequency scaling  --->
    <*>   AMD Opteron/Athlon64 PowerNow!
    <*>   AMD frequency sensitivity feedback powersave bias
Device Drivers  --->
  [*] IOMMU Hardware Support  --->
    [*]   AMD IOMMU support
    <*>     AMD IOMMU Version 2 driver
}}

Those using {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} with the <code>experimental</code> USE flag will have additional Processor family options made available:

{{KernelBox|title=Kernel 4.11.0 (gentoo-sources)|1=
Processor type and features  --->
  Processor family (MZEN)  --->
    (X) AMD Zen
}}

This enables <code>-march=znver1</code> to be set for the kernel's {{c|make}} process.

{{Tip|Alternatively, <code>Generic-x86-64</code> can be set in the Processor family for more generic CPU support. In theory this would make the kernel binaries portable in the event that it would be use on CPUs other than AMD Ryzen.}}

== Configuration ==

=== GCC ===

{{Tip|Article [[Safe CFLAGS]] has a [[Safe CFLAGS#Ryzen (Zen)|Ryzen (Zen)]] section.}}

==== GCC 6.3+ ====

GCC 6.3+ has support for the <code>znver1</code> compiler optimization. For optimal performance, this can be enabled in {{Path|make.conf}}.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Zen compiler optimization|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=znver1"
}}

GCC 6.3 is not presently optimized for Ryzen. <ref>[https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=80313 GCC bug report]</ref>

==== GCC 5.4 ====

While GCC 5.4 does not support zen core specific optimization, <code>-march=bdver4</code> has been shown to be functional and stable. However, since Zen dropped the instruction set extensions FMA4, TBM, XOP and LWP, they should be disabled accordingly:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Zen compiler optimization for GCC 5.4 and lower|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=bdver4 -mno-fma4 -mno-tbm -mno-xop -mno-lwp"
}}

{{Note|Previously <code>-march{{=}}haswell</code> was said to be functional with Zen<ref>https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=80313</ref>, but a Gentoo developer experienced various SEGVs with this option.}}
{{Note|The use of bare <code>-march{{=}}bdver4</code> was said to be functional without issues, nevertheless it may still produce faulty code due to the lack of before mentioned instruction set extensions. Bulldozer has them, Zen does not. <!-- FMA4 and XOP was introduced with Bulldozer "bdver1" and TBM with Piledriver "bdver2". -->}}

Optional, but may produce better code: Add new instruction set extensions introduced with Zen individually (ADCX, RDSEED, MWAITX, SHA, CLZERO, XSAVEC, XSAVES, CLFLUSHOPT, POPCNT), using <code>-march=bdver4</code> (Bulldozer Version 4 i.e. Excavator<!--: Carrizo and Bristol Ridge like the AMD A12 9800 -->) as the starting point:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=EXPERIMENTAL compiler optimization for GCC 5.4 specifying new extensions for Zen|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=bdver4 -mno-fma4 -mno-tbm -mno-xop -mno-lwp -mclzero -madx -mrdseed -mmwaitx -msha -mxsavec -mxsaves -mclfushopt -mpopcnt"
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Segmentation faults during compilation ===
If segfaults are encountered during compilation process on Zen it might be anything from software bug to a hardware bug. There have been reports of success and failure. The recommendation is to disable all overclocking and set proper timings for RAM. These problems are likely to be fixed in the future by AMD microcode update and/or GCC update.

Please ensure the most recently compiled binutils is selected via 

{{Cmd|eselect binutils list|output=<pre>
 [1] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-2.27
 [2] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-2.28 *
</pre>
}}

* An older instance of binutils could be built against older opcode facilitating crashes due to poor linkage
* Ensure RAM voltage and timing are correct for your RAM, BIOS's are conservative while performing autosetting
* Consider downgrading BIOS to the most stable. ASUS and ASRock have been known to push very beta bios's that have shown to be very unstable
