Ryzen is [[Article description::a multithreaded, high performance processor released by AMD in Q1, 2017. It is the first CPU released based on the [[wikipedia:Zen_(microarchitecture)|Zen microarchitecture]].]] Its goal is to directly compete with Intel's Broadwell-E processor line, primarily the Core i7-6900K.

== Installation ==

=== Firmware ===

To install the Zen microcode, emerge {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}:

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}

The firmware blobs will need to be added to the kernel in order to be loaded.

=== Kernel ===

Enable support for Ryzen hardware in kernel 4.11.0:

{{KernelBox|title=Kernel 4.11.0|1=
Processor type and features  --->
  [*] Symmetric multi-processing support
  [*] AMD ACPI2Platform devices support
  Processor family (Opteron/Athlon64/Hammer/K8)  --->
    (X) Opteron/Athlon64/Hammer/K8
  [*] Supported processor vendors  --->
    [*]   Support AMD processors (NEW)
  [*] SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support
  [*] Multi-core scheduler support
  [*] Machine Check / overheating reporting
  [*]   AMD MCE features
  Performance monitoring  --->
    <*> AMD Processor Power Reporting Mechanism
  [*]   AMD microcode loading support

    <*>   AMD frequency sensitivity feedback powersave bias
Device Drivers  --->
  Generic Driver Options --->

    (/lib/firmware) Firware blobs root directory
  [*] IOMMU Hardware Support  --->
    [*]   AMD IOMMU support
    <*>     AMD IOMMU Version 2 driver
}}

Those using {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} with the <code>experimental</code> USE flag will have additional Processor family options made available:

{{KernelBox|title=Kernel 4.11.0 (gentoo-sources)|1=
Processor type and features  --->
  Processor family (MZEN)  --->
    (X) AMD Zen
}}

This enables <code>-march=znver1</code> to be set for the kernel's {{c|make}} process.

{{Tip|Alternatively, <code>Generic-x86-64</code> can be set in the Processor family for more generic CPU support. In theory this would make the kernel binaries portable in the event that it would be use on CPUs other than AMD Ryzen.}}

== Configuration ==

=== GCC ===

==== GCC 6.3+ ====

GCC 6.3+ has support for the <code>znver1</code> compiler optimization. For optimal performance, this can be enabled in {{Path|make.conf}}.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Zen compiler optimization|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=znver1"
}}

GCC 6.3 is not presently optimized for Ryzen. <ref>[https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=80313 GCC bug report]</ref>

==== GCC 5.4 ====

While GCC 5.4 does not support zen core specific optimization, <code>-march=bdver4</code> has been shown to be functional and stable. However, since Zen dropped the instruction set extensions FMA4, TBM, XOP and LWP, they should be disabled accordingly:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Zen compiler optimization for GCC 5.4 and lower|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=bdver4 -mno-fma4 -mno-tbm -mno-xop -mno-lwp"
}}

{{Important|Previously <code>-march{{=}}haswell</code> was said to be functional with Zen<ref>https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=80313</ref>, but a Gentoo developer experienced various SEGVs with this option.}}
{{Important|The use of bare <code>-march{{=}}bdver4</code> was said to be functional without issues, nevertheless it may still produce faulty code due to the lack of before mentioned instruction set extensions. Bulldozer has them, Zen does not. <!-- FMA4 and XOP was introduced with Bulldozer "bdver1" and TBM with Piledriver "bdver2". -->}}

Optional, but may produce better code: Add new instruction set extensions introduced with Zen individually (ADCX, RDSEED, MWAITX, SHA, CLZERO, XSAVEC, XSAVES, CLFLUSHOPT, POPCNT), using <code>-march=bdver4</code> (Bulldozer Version 4 i.e. Excavator<!--: Carrizo and Bristol Ridge like the AMD A12 9800 -->) as the starting point:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=EXPERIMENTAL compiler optimization for GCC 5.4 specifying new extensions for Zen|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=bdver4 -mno-fma4 -mno-tbm -mno-xop -mno-lwp -mclzero -madx -mrdseed -mmwaitx -msha -mxsavec -mxsaves -mclflushopt -mpopcnt"
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Segmentation faults during compilation ===
If segfaults are encountered during compilation process on Zen it might be anything from software bug to a hardware bug. There have been reports of success and failure, but if an early CPU batch is affected, it should be replaced through RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) which AMD provides on its website. The recommendation to disable all overclocking and set proper timings for RAM is only for systems that were overclocked - at the designated speed CPU and RAM will not produce recurring segfaults when compiling!

Please ensure the most recently compiled binutils is selected via 

{{Cmd|eselect binutils list|output=<pre>
 [1] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-2.27
 [2] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-2.28 *
</pre>
}}

==== Faulty Hardware ====
As of 2017-08-08 AMD confirmed a problem residing inside the Ryzen processor itself. This problem should only affect the very few early Ryzen batches that were produced. AMD is aware of the issue<ref>Phoronix - [http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ryzen-Segv-Response AMD '''Confirms''' Linux Performance Marginality Problem Affecting Some, Doesn't Affect Epyc / Theadripper]</ref><ref>AMD Forums - [https://community.amd.com/thread/215773 gcc segmentation faults on Ryzen / Linux]</ref> and RMA was (is) possible within the warranty period.

{{Note|The following was only applicable to mitigate CPUs that produced segfaults due to faulty hardware (CPUs). For replaced CPUs and newer revisions, none of the following is recommended!}}
* An older instance of binutils could be built against older opcode facilitating crashes due to poor linkage.
* Consider downgrading or upgrading the BIOS/UEFI to the most stable.
* Some motherboards' BIOS/UEFI have an option to disable OPCache. This has been observed to limit or stop segfaults albeit with a 5-7% performance cost.
* Some users have reported that disabling ASLR resolves the segfault issues. This can be done at runtime by issuing <code>echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</code> and to make it permanent:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sysctl.conf|title=Disabling ASLR|lang=bash|1=
kernel.randomize_va_space = 0
}}

==== Overclocking or wrong settings ====
If you experience segfaults on an otherwise healthy system, the following could help to solve the problem:
* Ensure RAM voltage and timing are correct for the RAM; BIOSs are conservative while performing autosetting.
* Consider downgrading the BIOS/UEFI to the most stable. ASUS and ASRock have been known to push very beta BIOSs that have shown to be very unstable.

=== Random reboots with mce events ===
If your system runs 24x7 and you encounter random, spontaneous reboots with MCE hardware errors being logged on startup, consider disabling C-States. This can be done the BIOS or with the boot parameter processor.max_cstate=5. An example MCE event looks like this:
<pre>Oct 31 11:46:23 fire kernel: [    0.677235] [Hardware Error]: System Fatal error.
