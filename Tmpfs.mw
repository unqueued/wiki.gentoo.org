'''tmpfs''' ('''T'''e'''mp'''orary '''F'''ile '''S'''ystem) is a virtual [[filesystem]] to store files in memory. 

{{Important|The volatile memory can't keep the files after shutdown, reboot or crash. Only store recoverable files in tmpfs.}}

== Installation ==
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{KernelBox|1=
File systems  --->
     Pseudo filesystems  --->
          [*] Tmpfs virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
          [ ] Optional drivers
}}

|}

== Usage ==
Generation and mounting of tmpfs is on step: 
{{RootCmd|mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /MOUNTPOINT}}

You can specify the mount option ''size'' to control the maximum size of the filesystem (default: half of your memory). Note, that tmpfs doesn't reserve this memory, but allocates only the needed memory.
