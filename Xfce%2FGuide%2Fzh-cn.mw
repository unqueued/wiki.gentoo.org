本指南对Xfce进行了广泛的介绍。Xfce是一个快捷的、轻量级的，功能齐全的桌面环境。

=== 介绍 ===

=== Xfce桌面环境 ===

[http://www.xfce.org Xfce] 是类Unix操作系统上的一个快捷、轻量级的桌面环境。它是为生产力而设计的，并且具备很好的可配置性，同时还符合 [http://www.freedesktop.org Freedesktop]的规范。 

不像 [http://www.gnome.org Gnome] 和 [http://www.kde.org KDE] 等这些重量级的桌面环境，Xfce占用的系统资源要少得多。另外，它拥有更好的模块性和更少的依赖性；它将占用你更少的磁盘空间和更少的安装时间。 

这篇指南将不仅向你说明如何安装和配置一个最小化的Xfce环境，并且还将探索一些可用方案来创建一个功能齐全的桌面环境，保持与Xfce设计思想的一致：轻巧，快速和模块化。 

这篇指南的最后的部分列出了一些在升级到新的Xfce版本后需要运行的命令，如果你正在从旧版本升级，请务必遵循。 

== 安装 ==

=== 基础 ===

首先，确定你已经按照 [[Xorg/Guide|Xorg 指南]] 一文所说的配置好了Xorg。如果没有的话那么本指南下面的步骤可能无法正常工作。

接着，请反复检查 {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} 文件里的 USE 标记；多数用户需要设置下面的 USE flags：

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Xfce 常用的 USE flags |lang=bash|1=
USE="-gnome -kde -minimal -qt4 dbus jpeg lock session startup-notification thunar udev X"
}}

=== 安装 ===

现在你已经在 {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} 设置好了你的 <code>USE</code> 标记，是时候安装 Xfce 了。 

{{Emerge|xfce-base/xfce4-meta}}

如果需要，把系统上的一般用户（们）加到<code>cdrom</code>，<code>cdrw</code> 和 <code>usb</code> 组里，这样他/她们便能挂载和使用照相机、光驱和U盘等之类的设备。

{{RootCmd|for x in cdrom cdrw usb ; do gpasswd -a username $x ; done}}

更新系统的环境变量： 

{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

要在新的桌面环境下继续工作，一个图形终端是有必要的。{{Package|x11-terms/xfce4-terminal}} 是一个很好的选择，因为它是为 Xfce 定制的。使用如下命令安装终端： 

{{Emerge|x11-terms/xfce4-terminal}}

== 配置 ==

=== 启动Xfce ===

现在 Xfce 已经安装完毕，接着我们将把它设置成我们默认的桌面环境，一旦我们执行 <tt>startx</tt> 便可进入。将你的 root 用户退出然后以普通用户的身份登录。 

{{Cmd|echo "exec startxfce4" > ~/.xinitrc}}

{{Note/zh-cn|如果你安装了 ConsoleKit，你的 {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} 则应该包含 <tt>exec startxfce4 --with-ck-launch</tt>。否则，某些应用程序将不能运行。你也需要把 consolekit 加入 default 运行级别。用 root 执行这个命令：<tt>rc-update add consolekit default</tt>。}}

Now start your graphical environment by typing <tt>startx</tt>: 

{{Cmd|startx}}

恭喜！欢迎进入你新的Xfce桌面环境。继续看下去，再深入探索一点。接下去的部分将教你如何根据自己的要求来配置Xfce。 

=== Sessions and startup ===

If you've installed (or plan to install) popular Gnome or KDE applications such as <tt>k3b</tt>, <tt>nautilus</tt>, <tt>kmail</tt>, <tt>evolution</tt>, etc. then you should make sure that Xfce launches the appropriate services for these at startup. Navigate to {{Path|Menu --> Settings --> Sessions & Startup}}. On the {{Path|Advanced}} tab, select the appropriate checkbox. This might slightly increase Xfce startup times, but it decreases load times for KDE and Gnome applications. 

Xfce has the ability to save your session settings and running programs from the {{Path|General}} tab in the {{Path|Sessions & Startup}} menu. They can be automatically saved when you logout, or Xfce can ask you each time. This feature is particularly useful for undoing configuration mistakes. Accidentally killed a panel? Just select "No" when prompted to save your current session, and the next time you start Xfce, your old desktop is restored. Want to automatically launch your open web browser, terminal, and email client the next time you login? Just save your session before logging out. 

你现在已经安装并配置了一个基本的工作环境。但如果你还有兴趣动手做更多的事情，请接着看下去！ 

=== Additional applications ===

Every user should consider installing some or all of the following useful applications and utilities:

{{Emerge|xfce-extra/xfce4-mixer xfce-extra/xfce4-taskmanager x11-themes/xfwm4-themes app-office/orage app-editors/mousepad xfce-extra/xfce4-power-manager x11-terms/xfce4-terminal xfce-base/thunar}}

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|-
! Package 
! Description
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-mixer}}
| A volume control for your sound card. It can also be run as a panel applet, giving you fast access to playback volume. {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-taskmanager}} displays a list of all running programs, and the CPU and memory consumption each one takes up. By right-clicking an item, you can kill a misbehaving application, pause and restart it, or even alter its run time priority, which lets you fine-tune how much of a demand it puts on your system's resources. 
|-
| {{Package|x11-themes/xfwm4-themes}}
| Adds several window manager themes. You may want to add a more full-coverage icon theme such as {{Package|x11-themes/tango-icon-theme}} just to round out your desktop. 
|-
| {{Package|app-office/orage}}
| A simple, handy calendar. {{Package|app-editors/mousepad}} is a bare bones text editor that starts up extremely quickly. 
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-power-manager}}
| An application to monitor and manage power usage. This is especially important for laptops! The power manager allows user to adjust screen brightness, choose maximum performance or battery-saving modes, and setup hibernate, suspend, and shutdown actions when the lid is shut or buttons are pressed. [http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/xfce4-power-manager xfce4-power-manager] can be set to provide warning when the battery reaches certain levels, or even turn off the machine. The application comes with a couple of helpful panel plugins to display battery/charging status, and a brightness control. 
|-
| {{Package|x11-terms/xfce4-terminal}}
| An X11 terminal emulator, far more configurable and useful than the barebones<code>xterm</code>. xfce4-terminal supports Unicode text, color schemes, pseudo-transparency and hardware-accelerated transparency via Xfce's built-in compositor, all out-of-the-box. Just make sure that the default action on the terminal launcher of your panel runs {{Path|/usr/bin/Terminal}} instead of <tt>xterm</tt>. Right-click the launcher and choose {{Path|Properties}} to change the command. 
|-
| {{Package|xfce-base/thunar}}
| Xfce's default graphical file manager. It is fast yet quite powerful, can support several plugins for even more functionality; just install them with <tt>emerge</tt>. These plugins include: {{Package|xfce-extra/thunar-archive-plugin}} which lets users create and extract archive files using the right-click menu. It provides a handy [http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/thunar-plugins/thunar-archive-plugin front-end] for graphical archiving applications such as <tt>xarchiver</tt> and <tt>file-roller</tt>.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/tumbler}}
| Lets users preview certain types of files from within Thunar, such as images and fonts.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/thunar-volman}}
| Automatically [http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/thunar-plugins/thunar-volman manages] removable media and drives.
|}
 
==== Desktop applications ====

Next, let's see about adding some useful but lightweight desktop applications, staying with Xfce's philosophy. 

Though {{Package|app-editors/mousepad}} is nice enough as a basic text editor, if you need a full-featured word processor but don't want the bloat of LibreOffice, try emerging {{Package|app-office/abiword}}. [http://www.abisource.com AbiWord] is lighter, faster, and is completely inter-operable with industry-standard document types. 

Need a nice email client/newsreader that is not as demanding as {{Package|mail-client/thunderbird}} or {{Package|mail-client/evolution}}? Try emerging {{Package|mail-client/claws-mail}}. 

For your internet chat needs, {{Package|net-irc/irssi}} is an excellent, tiny, incredibly configurable IRC client that runs in your terminal. If you prefer a compact all-in-one client that handles nearly all chat protocols, you may want to <tt>emerge</tt> {{Package|net-im/pidgin}}. 

If you need movie and music players, look no further than {{Package|media-video/mplayer}} and [http://www.gentoo.org//proj/en/desktop/sound/decibel.xml decibel-audio-player]. They can play most every media format available quite nicely. 

Finally, you'll need a web browser. Nearly all graphical web browsers require more resources than most of your other desktop applications. Still, Firefox and Medori are always good choices. Alternatively, you may find Opera to be quite fast. However, Opera is not available on as many processor architectures as Firefox, and it has more dependencies unless you override them with a few USE flags. 

{{Emerge|www-client/firefox}}

{{Emerge|www-client/midori}}

{{RootCmd|echo "www-client/opera gtk -kde" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{Emerge|www-client/opera}}

到这里，我们已经提出一些很好的建议来丰富你的桌面应用，接着，看看我们还可以做些什么来提升你的Xfce体验。 

==== Panel plugins ====

在这一小节里面，我们将讨论一些在Xfce里面每天都会用到的有用插件和应用软件。 

There are many plugins for the panel available in Portage; see for yourself with <tt>emerge --search xfce</tt>. Though for the most part their names are self-explanatory, a few deserve extra attention, as they are quite helpful. To use them, simply <tt>emerge</tt> them. They'll be added to the list of available items in the {{Path|Add New Items}} menu shown when you right-click on the panel. 

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|-
! Package
! Description
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-battery-plugin}}
| Perfect for laptop users. It displays battery percentage, time remaining, power source (AC or battery), fan status, warnings, and can even be configured to execute commands at certain power levels. This feature can be used to put the laptop into hibernate mode when the battery is almost exhausted.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-verve-plugin}}
| A small command line embedded into the panel. It is quicker than opening up a terminal to run a command.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-mount-plugin}}
| Provides a handy method of mounting devices listed in {{Path|/etc/fstab}} just by clicking the mouse.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-sensors-plugin}}
| Lets users monitor hardware sensors, such as CPU temperature, fan RPM, hard drive temp, motherboard voltage, and more.
|}

=== 图形界面登录 ===

Remember when the {{c|startxfce4}} line was added to the {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} file? All you have to do to get into your desktop is type {{c|startx}} after logging in. This is fine if you prefer a completely text-based boot and login, but let's use a display manager that will automatically start Xfce after booting (so that you can login graphically). 

首先，让我们确定下系统启动后加载了Xfce： 

{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

We aren't quite finished yet. We have to pick a display manager and set the appropriate variable. Though there are a few choices available in Portage, for this guide, we'll stick with [[SLiM]], the Simple Login Manager. 

{{Package|x11-misc/slim}} is speedy and lightweight, with minimal dependencies. Perfect for Xfce! 

{{Emerge|x11-misc/slim}}

{{Note|The <code>branding</code> USE flag will pull in the {{Package|x11-themes/slim-themes}} package, which will give you an assortment of login themes, including a Gentoo Linux theme.}}

Then edit the <code>DISPLAYMANAGER</code> variable in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/xdm}}: 

{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
DISPLAYMANAGER="slim"
</pre>
}}

SLiM can automatically start your Xfce session if you add <code>XSESSION="Xfce4"</code> to {{Path|/etc/env.d/90xsession}}: 

{{RootCmd|echo XSESSION{{=}}\"Xfce4\" > /etc/env.d/90xsession
|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

=== Beautifying the desktop ===

A little customization of the desktop's appearance can go a long way. Xfce has all the options one would expect from a modern desktop environment, font anti-aliasing settings, color schemes, dozens of window decorations, themes, and more. If these are not enough, it is easy to install third-party themes, icon sets, mouse cursor themes, and wallpapers. 

A selection of nice Gentoo wallpapers in a variety of resolutions are hosted on the [https://www.gentoo.org/inside-gentoo/artwork/#wallpapers Gentoo website]. When looking for icon sets and complete Xfce themes, [http://www.xfce-look.org/ Xfce-Look] has a huge collection. The important thing to remember about any third-party eye candy is that it will usually need to be unpacked and then installed to the proper directory. Icon sets go in {{Path|/usr/share/icons/}}, and themes go to {{Path|/usr/share/themes/}}; use these directories for all users to be able to access themes and icon sets. Individual users can install themes and icon sets to their home directories in {{Path|~/.themes/}} and {{Path|~/.icons/}}. 

If SLiM  has been installed as the display manager, there are lots of themes in the {{Package|x11-themes/slim-themes}} package available in the main Gentoo repository. Also, be sure to check the SLiM [http://slim.berlios.de/themes01.php themes page] for more themes. Creating your own SLiM theme is fairly easy; just read the [http://slim.berlios.de/themes_howto.php Themes HowTo].

Finally, Xfce has its own built-in compositor to manage window transparency. This option can be found in {{Path|Menu --> Settings --> Window Manager}}. For best performance, you will need to be running a graphics card with drivers that support hardware-accelerated rendering. Make sure the {{Package|xfce-base/xfwm4}} package has been emerged with the <code>xcomposite</code> USE flag, then enable compositing in {{Path|/etc/X11/xorg.conf}} by adding the following section: 

{{File|xorg.conf|Enabling composite|<pre>
Section "Extensions"
    Option  "Composite"  "Enable"
EndSection
</pre>
}}

This is the bare minimum configuration required for Xfce and Xorg-X11. However, setting up hardware-accelerated rendering depends on the system's graphics card, and is beyond the scope of this guide. Please see the other guides in the [[Project:Desktop|Desktop resources]] to learn about configuring hardware-accelerated rendering for various graphic cards. 

Once finished setting up a beautiful Xfce desktop, the next thing to do is take a screenshot of it to share with other folks! Install {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-screenshooter}} and post the pictures somewhere for all to admire.

=== Summary ===

祝贺你已经走到这么远了！你已经为你的计算需要安装配置了快捷的桌面环境和可靠的应用套件。

== Upgrading ==

When upgrading Xfce from earlier major versions (4.x), the old cached sessions and profiles will need to be removed; they are incompatible with new releases. For each user, run the following commands to remove the old incompatible cached sessions and profile: 

{{RootCmd|rm -r ~/.cache/sessions
|rm -r ~/.config/xfce*
|rm -r ~/.config/Thunar}}

Users will be greeted with a new and shiny interface, but will lose many of their individual settings. Sadly, no migration of configuration(s) exist... 

== External resources ==

对于配置和使用Xfce你还需要其它的帮助吗？还想得到更多轻量级应用程序的建议？试试到这里找找：
