== Installation ==

Installed in non-UEFI mode. Recommend Live-Distributions that do not boot
into X11, since they will freeze most certainly. Use Gentoo's DVD.

=== Firmware ===
Required for WiFi.
 
=== Kernel ===
Latest (stable) kernel is recommended. 

==== Keyboard backlight ==== 
[https://bitbucket.org/tuxedocomputers/clevo-xsm-wmi/overview clevo-xsm-wmi mod<ule] required to get control over keyboard backlight. After building and loading this module, you can turn the backlight off or change colours etc. 

This module may not work with kernel version 4.14 at this time, see the [https://bitbucket.org/tuxedocomputers/clevo-xsm-wmi/issues/32/module-does-not-work-with-kernel-version bug report].
=== Emerge ===


{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}



== NVIDIA GPU ==
=== nouveau === 
It might be required to add acpi_rev_override=1 to the kernel boot cmdline.

Additionally:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/modprobe.d/nouveau.conf|1=
options nouveau runpm=0
}}

Given however that this disables runtime power management, you probably want to blacklist the module instead and use bbswitch to disable it. If nouveau is not loaded and GPU is off Xorg may also freeze. Hence, disable it only after you have successfully opened Xorg.

In the times you need it, do the following:
{{RootCmd |<nowiki>echo ON > /proc/acpi/bbswitch</nowiki> |rmmod bbswitch |<nowiki>modprobe nouveau runpm=0</nowiki> }}

An already running Xorg server might crash, thus it's better to stop Xorg, then run these commands before starting Xorg again.

=== nvidia-drivers (propritary) ===
It might be required to add acpi_rev_override=1 to the kernel boot cmdline. No additional laptop-specified instructions were used, see [[NVIDIA]].

This driver appears to be working at this point, external displays weren't tried though. 


=== Freezes when starting Xorg, or when switching to tty from Xorg ===
Please see [[#NVIDIA GPU]]
