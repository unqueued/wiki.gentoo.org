== Installation ==

Installed in non-UEFI mode. Recommend Live-Distributions that do not boot
into X11, since they will freeze most certainly. Use Gentoo's DVD.

=== Firmware ===
Required for WiFi.
 
=== Kernel ===
Latest (stable) kernel is recommended. 

==== Keyboard backlight ==== 
[https://bitbucket.org/tuxedocomputers/clevo-xsm-wmi/overview clevo-xsm-wmi module] required to get control over keyboard backlight. After building and loading this module, you can turn the backlight off or change colours etc. 
=== Emerge ===


{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}


== Troubleshooting ==

=== Freezes with X11, or when switching to tty from X11 ===
Happens on my system with kernel version 4.13.12. Make sure nouveau is not loaded.
