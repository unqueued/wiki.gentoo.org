== Installation ==

Installed in non-UEFI mode. Recommend Live-Distributions that do not boot
into X11, since they will freeze most certainly. Use Gentoo's DVD.

=== Firmware ===
Required for WiFi.
 
=== Kernel ===
Latest (stable) kernel is recommended. 

==== Keyboard backlight ==== 
[https://bitbucket.org/tuxedocomputers/clevo-xsm-wmi/overview clevo-xsm-wmi module] required to get control over keyboard backlight. After building and loading this module, you can turn the backlight off or change colours etc. 

This module may not work with kernel version 4.14 at this time, see the [https://bitbucket.org/tuxedocomputers/clevo-xsm-wmi/issues/32/module-does-not-work-with-kernel-version bug report].
=== Emerge ===


{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}


== Troubleshooting ==

=== Freezes with X11, or when switching to tty from X11 ===
Happens on my system with kernel version 4.13.12. Make sure nouveau is not loaded.
