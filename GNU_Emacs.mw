{{Note|1=USE flags for toolkits <code>gtk</code>, <code>Xaw3d</code>, <code>athena</code>, and <code>motif</code> are mutually exclusive. Generally, <code>USE="gtk"</code> is a good choice. However, if you intend to use Emacs as a daemon, <code>USE="Xaw3d -gtk"</code> is recommended instead because of {{bug|292471}}.}}

<!--
*<code>X</code> = enable X windows interface<br />
*<code>gtk</code> = enable gtk interface<br />
*<code>jpeg</code> = enables support for displaying jpeg images (will only be useful if <code>X</code> is also enabled)<br />
*<code>png</code> = support for png images (will probably want if you use DocView mode to read PDFs)<br />
*<code>gif</code> = support for gif images<br />
*<code>xft</code> = support for TrueType fonts (such as the Liberation family of fonts)<br />
