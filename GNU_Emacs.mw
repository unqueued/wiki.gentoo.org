'''GNU Emacs''' is a powerful, extensible, self-documenting text editor. It is released by the Free Software Foundation and has been under development since 1976. In Gentoo, GNU Emacs is maintained by the team of the same name, which can be reached through {{Mail|emacs@gentoo.org}}. Detailed developer information can be found on the [[Project:Emacs|project page]].

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-editors/emacs-vcs}}

{{Note|USE flags for toolkits <code>gtk</code>, <code>motif</code>, and <code>athena</code> are mutually exclusive. Generally, <code>USE{{=}}"gtk"</code> is a good choice. However, if intending to use Emacs as a daemon, <code>USE{{=}}"motif -athena -gtk -Xaw3d"</code> or <code>USE{{=}}"athena Xaw3d -gtk -motif"</code> is recommended instead because of {{bug|292471}}. <code>USE{{=}}"athena Xaw3d"</code> resembles <code>USE{{=}}"gtk"</code> very well.}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|app-editors/emacs}}

== Several versions side-by-side ==

In Gentoo, several Emacs versions can be installed on a system simultaneously. The upstream version already installs elisp and data files into versioned subdirectories. To avoid file collisions between slots, in the Gentoo installation also binaries and man pages are suffixed with their corresponding version number.

The eselect module from {{Package|app-eselect/eselect-emacs}} can be used to link {{Path|/usr/bin/emacs}} and its auxiliary programs to the ones belonging to the desired Emacs version. Consult the [[Project:Eselect/User guide|eselect user guide]] for details on eselect.

== Configuration ==

Emacs can be customized by clicking through the GUI (use {{Key|M-x}} <code>customize-group</code> {{Key|RET}}) or by using the {{Path|~/.emacs}} configuration file which is written in Emacs Lisp, Emacs' own Lisp dialect.

== Documentation ==

For a quick-start documentation, type in Emacs: {{Key|C-h t}} ({{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|h}} followed by {{Key|t}}). For further help on how to use Emacs, start <tt>emacs</tt> and type {{Key|C-h r}} ({{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|h}} followed by {{Key|r}}). To exit Emacs, type {{Key|C-x C-c}} ({{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|x}} followed by {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|c}}).

== Additional elisp packages ==

Emacs has lots of additional packages written in elisp. There is a number of ways of their distribution, but the standard one is [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA package.el] nowadays. On Gentoo in can be used both on per-user and system-wide way.

To install package per-user use [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA package.el] distributed with GNU Emacs.

To install elisp packages system-wide under the Portage control you can use [https://github.com/jauhien/gs-elpa gs-elpa]. Read [[layman]] documentation before using it, as gs-elpa represents ELPA repositories as layman overlays. It currently supports 4 repositories: [https://elpa.gnu.org/ gnu-elpa], [https://marmalade-repo.org/ marmalade],
[http://melpa.milkbox.net/ melpa] and [http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/ melpa-stable].

When the layman setup works, install gs-elpa:

{{Emerge|app-portage/gs-elpa}}

After it you can start adding elisp repos and emerging packages, e.g.:

{{RootCmd|layman -L}}

{{RootCmd|layman -a gnu-elpa}}

{{RootCmd|layman -a melpa-stable}}

{{Emerge|app-emacs/starter-kit app-emacs/starter-kit-bindings app-emacs/starter-kit-eshell app-emacs/starter-kit-lisp}}

{{Warning|Always add gnu-elpa repository first, as other repos depend on it.}}

Bugs related to gs-elpa should be reported on [https://github.com/jauhien/gs-elpa/issues its issue tracker].

If you ever find bugs like [https://github.com/jauhien/gs-elpa/issues/6], you can exclude packages from dependencies adding their name to the "external" object in the "common-config" section of /etc/g-sorcery/gs-elpa.json config file. For the example issue it would be (together with already added packages):

    "external": {"emacs": "virtual/emacs", "cl-lib": "virtual/emacs", "eieio": "virtual/emacs"}
