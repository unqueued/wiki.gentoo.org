'''GNU Emacs''' is a powerful, extensible, self-documenting text editor. It is released by the Free Software Foundation and under development since 1976. In Gentoo GNU Emacs is maintained by the team of the same name, which can be reached through [mailto:emacs@gentoo.org emacs@gentoo.org]. Detailed developer information can be found on the [[Project:Emacs|project page]].

== Installation ==
{{Emerge|app-editors/emacs}}

Explanation of USE Flags:
{{USEflag
|package=app-editors/emacs-vcs
|desc=Flags for window system and toolkit selection
|aqua
|athena
|gtk++yes
|gtk3+yes+yes
|motif
|toolkit-scroll-bars
|X++yes
|Xaw3d
}}
{{Note|USE flags for toolkits <code>gtk</code>, <code>motif</code>, and <code>athena</code> are mutually exclusive. Generally, <code>USE{{=}}"gtk"</code> is a good choice. However, if you intend to use Emacs as a daemon, <code>USE{{=}}"motif -athena -gtk -Xaw3d"</code> or <code>USE{{=}}"athena Xaw3d -gtk -motif"</code> is recommended instead because of {{bug|292471}}. <code>USE{{=}}"athena Xaw3d"</code> resembles <code>USE{{=}}"gtk"</code> very well.}}

== Several versions side-by-side ==
In Gentoo, several Emacs versions can installed on a system simultaneously. The upstream version already installs elisp and data files into versioned subdirectories. To avoid file collisions between slots, in the Gentoo installation also binaries and man pages are suffixed with their corresponding version number.

The eselect module from {{Package|app-admin/eselect-emacs}} can be used to link {{Path|/usr/bin/emacs}} and its auxiliary programs to the ones belonging to the desired Emacs version. Consult the [[Project:Eselect/User guide|eselect user guide]] for details on eselect.

== Configuration ==
You can customize Emacs by clicking through the GUI (use {{Key|M-x}} <code>customize-group</code> {{Key|RET}}) or with your {{Path|~/.emacs}} which is written in Emacs Lisp, Emacs' own Lisp dialect.

== Documentation ==
For a quick-start documentation, type in Emacs: {{Key|C-h t}} ({{Key|Ctrl-h}} followed by {{Key|t}}). For further help on how to use Emacs, start <code>emacs</code> and type {{Key|C-h r}}.
