Daniel J. Bernstein's daemontools package, described by him as "''[[Article description::a collection of tools for managing UNIX services]]''", is the pioneer of what some people call today ''process supervision suites'', i.e. packages that provide tools for performing process supervision<ref>D. J. Bernstein, [https://cr.yp.to/daemontools/faq/create.html#why daemontools FAQ], which includes one about the benefits of process supervision. Retrieved on April 23rd, 2017.</ref> <ref>Gerrit Pape, [http://smarden.org/runit/benefits.html runit benefits], which includes a short description of process supervision in general.

There are no further releases of daemontools after 0.76, but other software packages have been inspired by its design principles, notably [[runit]], [[s6]], [http://b0llix.net/perp/site.cgi?page=about perp], [[nosh]], and an enhanced succesor, [[daemontools-encore]] <ref>Jonathan de Boyne Pollard, [https://jdebp.eu/FGA/daemontools-family.html The daemontools family].
