'''mpv''' is a free and open source command-line media player. It is based on mplayer2, which in turn is based on the original [[MPlayer]].
Although there are still many similarities to its ancestors, mpv should generally be treated as a completely different program.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

Default USE configuration provides the following core features: CLI player, [[Xorg|X11]] support, audio and video playback, On-Screen Display (OSD) and On-Screen Controller (OSC), and [//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language) Lua] scripting interface.

Hardware video decoding is usually desired. mpv supports both [[VAAPI]] and [[VDPAU]] hardware decoding APIs via <code>vaapi</code> and <code>vdpau</code> USE flags respectively. You need to manually enable the API available on your system. mpv also supports [//docs.nvidia.com/cuda/video-decoder/ CUDA] hardware decoding API via <code>cuda</code> USE flag, but it is only available on [[ACCEPT_KEYWORDS#Stable_and_unstable_keywords|~arch]] systems with NVIDIA GPUs and [[NVidia/nvidia-drivers|proprietary drivers]].

For a complete set of features please refer to the list of USE flags below.

{{USEflag|package=media-video/mpv}}

=== Emerge ===

=== Additional software ===

Install {{Package|net-misc/youtube-dl}} to directly play URLs from YouTube and other popular streaming websites:

{{Emerge|net-misc/youtube-dl}}

Install {{Package|media-video/smplayer}} to have a GUI front-end:

{{Emerge|media-video/smplayer}}

== Configuration ==

mpv doesn't normally require any configuration. However, many aspects of the default behaviour can be changed.
Two most important parts of the configuration are player settings and key bindings. Both are briefly discussed below.

=== Player settings ===

Player settings should be put into {{Path|~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf}} file using the following syntax: <tt>option=value</tt>.
Everything after the {{c|#}} is considered a comment.

Nearly all command line options can be player settings. In most cases the equivalent of <tt>--option=value</tt> command line argument is <tt>option=value</tt> setting. Options that work without values can be enabled by setting them to {{c|yes}} and disabled by setting them to {{c|no}}.

To ease working with different configurations, profiles can be defined in the configuration file. A profile starts with its name in square brackets, e.g. {{c|[my-profile]}}. All following options will be a part of this profile. To end the profile, start another one or use the profile name {{c|default}} to continue with normal options.

For a complete list of available options please refer to [//mpv.io/manual/stable/#options the manual].

{{FileBox|title=Player settings example|filename=~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf|lang=ini|1=
# Always allow seeking, e.g. allow seeking within a local cache of HTTP stream
force-seekable=yes
# Always open a video window even with no video
force-window=yes
# Don't exit when the end of playlist is reached
keep-open=yes
# Always save the current playback position on exit
save-position-on-quit=yes

# Create 'high-quality' profile
[high-quality]
# Describe this profile
profile-desc="High quality rendering"
# Include all settings from the default 'opengl-hq' profile
profile=opengl-hq
# Disable debanding for better performance
deband=no
}}

=== Key bindings ===

Key bindings should be put into {{Path|~/.config/mpv/input.conf}} file using the following syntax: {{c|key command}}.
Everything after the {{c|#}} is considered a comment.

For a complete list of available commands please refer to [//mpv.io/manual/stable/#list-of-input-commands the manual].

{{FileBox|title=Key bindings example|filename=~/.config/mpv/input.conf|lang=ini|1=
# Ctrl+q closes player
Ctrl+q quit
# D removes the current file from playlist
D playlist-remove current
# R shuffles the current playlist
R playlist-shuffle
}}

=== Examples ===

Advanced real-world configurations from mpv contributors: [//github.com/pigoz/dotfiles/tree/master/mpv], [//github.com/Argon-/mpv-config].

== Usage ==

=== Lua scripts ===

Core mpv functionality can be extended with [//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language) Lua] scripts.
All scripts from {{Path|~/.config/mpv/scripts/}} directory are loaded automatically.
Alternatively you can load a script manually via command line, e.g. <tt>--script=/path/to/your/script.lua</tt>.

Several Lua scripts are shipped with mpv and installed into {{Path|/usr/share/mpv/lua/}} directory.
Upstream wiki also has [//github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts an extensive list of 3rd party scripts].

== Troubleshooting ==

{{Important|If you have any problems with mpv, enable verbose logging via <code>-v</code> command line option.}}

=== Broken playback/crashes after updating FFmpeg/Libav/libass/etc. ===

'''TLDR''': report a Gentoo bug, then rebuild mpv.

FFmpeg/Libav/libass are all known to introduce from time to time incompatible, ABI-breaking changes between minor releases.
Usually SLOTs of these libraries remain the same between minor releases, i.e. an automatic mpv rebuild isn't triggered.
This causes problems with mpv compiled against previous versions of these libraries. These problems vary from broken pieces of functionality to sudden crashes.

Upstream's answer in such cases is similar to <nowiki>''it's not our problem that others can't maintain proper ABI-compatibility, rebuild mpv''</nowiki>. Please first report a Gentoo bug to notify maintainers about the existing breakage, then rebuild mpv.

=== 'mpv was compiled against a different version of FFmpeg...' message ===

If you don't have any problems with mpv, ignore this message. Otherwise, please follow [[Mpv#Broken_playback.2Fcrashes_after_updating_FFmpeg.2FLibav.2Flibass.2Fetc.|these instructions]].

=== Broken hardware video decoding/high CPU usage ===

Always consult mpv log for any problems regarding hardware decoding. High CPU usage during video playback is a symptom of broken hardware decoding.

Firstly, make sure that your hardware supports the required video codec. The list of codecs supported by your GPU is available via <code>vainfo</code> and <code>vdpauinfo</code> commands for [[VAAPI]] and [[VDPAU]] decoding APIs respectively. The codec used in your video file is available in mpv log. If your GPU supports the required codec, but mpv doesn't do hardware decoding, try with <code>--hwdec-codecs=all</code> option.

Secondly, make sure that you have the latest non-live (not 9999) mpv version available in tree.
If the update to the latest version solves the problem, please report a Gentoo bug.

Now there are several things you can try:
* Enable hardware decoder with copy-back via <code>--hwdec=auto-copy</code>.
* VAAPI only: use {{c|vaapi}} output via <code>--vo=vaapi</code> with <code>--hwdec=vaapi</code> or <code>--hwdec=vaapi-copy</code>.
* VDPAU only: use {{c|vdpau}} output via <code>--vo=vdpau</code> with <code>--hwdec=vdpau</code> or <code>--hwdec=vdpau-copy</code>.
* VDPAU only: use {{c|X11/GLX}} backend for {{c|opengl}} output via <code>--opengl-backend=x11</code>.
* Intel GPUs only: use {{c|modesetting}} Xorg driver from {{Package|x11-base/xorg-server}}.
* Enable dumb-mode for {{c|opengl}} output via <code>--opengl-dumb-mode=yes</code>.
* Use {{c|xv}} output via <code>--vo=xv</code> with <code>--hwdec=auto-copy</code>.

=== Tearing ===

[//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing Tearing] is a video playback defect when displayed objects aren't properly lined up horizontally.
Please refer to [//github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/FAQ#Tearing the upstream FAQ].

=== Feature X is broken/unavailable with Libav ===

Quote from upstream: <nowiki>''Libav is basically unsupported by mpv, except it still sort of compiles and many things work''</nowiki>[//github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/3923#issuecomment-268120303]. Patches are welcome for any issues regarding Libav.

== Update notes ==

Upstream maintains [//github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/interface-changes.rst a list of user-visible changes].
The most important ones are discussed below.

<!-- Please proceed with caution. Several sections below are referred from ebuilds and must have correct info. -->
=== Volume in 0.18.1 ===
<!-- Please proceed with caution. This subsection is referred from ebuilds and must have correct info. -->

Since version 0.18.1 the software volume control is always enabled.
This means that volume controls don't change the system volume, e.g. per-application volume with [[PulseAudio]].

If you want to restore the previous behaviour, define the following [[Mpv#Key_bindings|key bindings]]:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/mpv/input.conf|lang=ini|1=
MOUSE_BTN5 add ao-volume -2
MOUSE_BTN6 add ao-volume +2
9 add ao-volume -2
0 add ao-volume +2
/ add ao-volume -2
* add ao-volume +2
m cycle ao-mute
VOLUME_DOWN add ao-volume -2
VOLUME_UP add ao-volume +2
MUTE cycle ao-mute
}}
{{Note|This covers only default volume key bindings as of version 0.18.0.}}

=== OSC in 0.21.0 ===
<!-- Please proceed with caution. This subsection is referred from ebuilds and must have correct info. -->

In version 0.21.0 the default OSC layout was changed to [//raw.githubusercontent.com/mpv-player/mpv.io/master/source/images/mpv-screenshot.jpg {{c|bottombar}}].

If you want to restore the previous layout, add the following [//mpv.io/manual/stable/#on-screen-controller OSC settings]:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/mpv/lua-settings/osc.conf|lang=ini|1=
layout=box
seekbarstyle=slider
deadzonesize=0
minmousemove=3
}}
{{Note|This covers only the default OSC layout as of version 0.20.0.}}

=== Deprecated VO/AO sub-options in 0.21.0 ===

In version 0.21.0 all VO/AO sub-options were deprecated and replaced by options. If you've been using those, please refer to [//github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/Option-replacement-list#mpv-0210 this replacement list].

=== Subtitles in .txt format in 0.24.0 ===

Since version 0.24.0 subtitles having .txt extension are no longer recognized as subtitles and thus no longer autoloaded. Please refer to [//github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/50991fac81eb56bc0985af2c9d31cd503302dcfe the offending commit's message] and [//github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/4144 this upstream issue] for more info.

If you want to restore the previous behaviour, please [[Mpv#Lua_scripts|use the following Lua script]]:
