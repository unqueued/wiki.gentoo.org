Cinnamon is a traditional and modern desktop environment: traditional desktop metaphor as Gnome 2, [[LXDE]] or [[Xfce]], with very good graphical and functional features. It is forked from Gnome Shell and developed for Linux Mint. It is provided for Gentoo as a Gnome package: [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/gnome-extra/cinnamon gnome-extra/cinnamon].

== With/Without Systemd ==

=== Without Systemd ===

Cinnamon works great without systemd. For that, eselect a profile without Gnome, as this one: <tt>default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop</tt> (platform and version can be different). To get system profiles list:
{{RootCmd|eselect profile list}}
Then to set the system profile:
{{RootCmd|eselect profile set n}}
(where '''n''' is profile number).

Also, follow the [[Gentoo_Without_systemd|Gentoo Without Systemd]] wiki page instructions.

=== With Systemd ===

For Cinnamon with systemd, eselect either the <tt>default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd</tt> profile for system-wide systemd, or <tt>default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome</tt> for Gnome systemd dependencies. The platform and version can be different.

== Installing ==

Of course, [[Xorg/Configuration|Xorg]] must be first installed for Cinnamon to work.

Cinnamon needs some USEflags: <code>icu</code> and <code>pulseaudio</code>. Add them to the system's {{Path|make.conf}} file:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="… icu pulseaudio …"
}}

You also can set them just for Cinnamon install, see below.

For Cinnamon, and other applications to be translated to a specific language, add the appropriate language to the {{Path|make.conf}}:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
LINGUAS="fr" # or en, de, it, es… etc.
}}

Cinnamon will need a few other packages in order to work properly: {{Package|x11-libs/gtk+extra}}, {{Package|gnome-extra/polkit-gnome}}, and {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting}}.

So, let's go to install!

If <code>icu</code> and <code>pulseaudio</code> were added to {{Path|make.conf}}:
{{Emerge|gnome-extra/cinnamon x11-libs/gtk+extra gnome-extra/polkit-gnome x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting}}

If not added:
{{RootCmd|USE{{=}}"pulseaudio icu" gnome-extra/cinnamon x11-libs/gtk+extra gnome-extra/polkit-gnome x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting}}

== Settings ==

=== Services ===

Xorg server and Cinnamon need the dbus and consolekit services, Cinnamon needs NetworkManager, add them at boot time:
{{RootCmd
|rc-update add dbus default
|rc-update add consolekit default
|rc-update add NetworkManager default
}}

Running these services before restart:
{{RootCmd
|/etc/init.d/consolekit start
|/etc/init.d/dbus start
|/etc/init.d/NetworkManager start
}}

=== Sudo ===

For an ordinary user to reboot or shutdown, sudo is needed with some settings. First install {{Package|app-admin/sudo}}:
{{Emerge|app-admin/sudo}}

Next modify sudo's configuration with the <tt>visudo</tt> command:

{{RootCmd|visudo}}

Visudo runs the default text editor with sudoers file, add for a named user:

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
userName  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
userName  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt
userName  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff
userName  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
}}
	
Or for the '''wheel''' group users:
{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
}}

=== Polkit Rules and Actions ===

For an ordinary user to perform root only actions, put a javascript file in {{Path|/etc/polkit-1/rules.d}}, for example named {{Path|55-allowing-actions.rules}} ({{Path|50-default.rules}} already exists).

Get the list of actions with <tt>pkaction</tt>, their names are quite self-explanatory:
{{RootCmd|pkaction}}

To authorize an user belonging to <code>wheel</code> group to suspend, hibernate, shutdown and restart:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/55-allowing-actions.rules|lang=javascript|1=
polkit.addRule (function (action, subject)
{
  if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate" {{!}}{{!}}
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.upower.suspend" {{!}}{{!}}
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop" {{!}}{{!}}
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart" &&
      subject.isInGroup ("wheel"))
      {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
      }
});
}}
All needed actions can be added to change color profiles, use nano (Cinnamon files manager) as root, mount and eject medias, set screen backlight, use network manager etc. Just don't make javascript mistakes…! Several <code>polkit.addRule (function (action, subject){ … }</code> blocks can be used.

== Starting Cinnamon ==

When not using a login/display manager, make a {{Path|.xinitrc}} file in the user's home directory with this content:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec cinnamon-session
}}

Then to start Xorg and Cinnamon, once logged in:
{{GenericCmd|startx}}

With a display manager follow their [[display manager|wiki pages]] instructions.

== Theming ==

=== Mint-X Icons ===

By default Cinnamon comes with gnome icons. [https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-x-icons Mint-X icons are on GitHub]. Download, unzip and put the desired icon set in {{Path|/usr/share/icons}}, then make a cache for it (sample for Mint-X icons, there are also colored sets with other names like {{Path|Mint-X-Grey}}):

{{RootCmd|gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/Mint-X}}

=== Desktop Icons Text Color ===

Text color in Cinnamon desktop is grey by default, not very readable, get white text by adding css rules in {{Path|/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-3.0/gtk.css}} (Adwaita is the default theme coming with Cinnamon install): 

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-3.0/gtk.css|lang=css|1=
@import url("resource:///org/gnome/adwaita/gtk-main.css");

/* added css rules */
.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item {
  color: #fff;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px @desktop_item_text_shadow;
}

.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item:selected {
  background-color: alpha(#fff, 0.2);
  background-image: none;
  color: #fff;
  text-shadow: none;
}
}}

The 2nd rule concerns selected desktop icons and can be modified to get others background color or transparency.

== Debugging ==

If problems launch Xorg server via ssh to get live error messages. More messages with <code>--debug</code> parameter for cinnamon-session:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec cinnamon-session --debug
}}

Alternatively you can have a look at {{Path|/var/log/Xorg.0.log}}.

If Cinnamon can't launch, deleting {{Path|.cinnamon}} in your home directory is not enough, other Cinnamon or Gnome (as <tt>dconf</tt>) items must be deleted too before X restart, in directories {{Path|.cache}} {{Path|.config}} {{Path|.local}}. {{Path|.gnome2}} can be entirely deleted.

== Installing common applications ==

Some usual Gnome, or not Gnome applications install.

=== Terminal ===

Lxterminal requires no dependencies, gnome-terminal needs systemd, mate-terminal should install all Mate desktop environment.

==== Without systemd ====

{{Emerge|lxde-base/lxterminal}}

==== With systemd ====

{{Emerge|x11-terms/gnome-terminal}}

=== Others ===

For example calculator, screen copy utility, pictures, PDF display, system monitor, archive manager…

{{Emerge|media-gfx/eog gnome-extra/gnome-calculator media-gfx/gnome-screenshot gnome-extra/gnome-system-monitor app-arch/file-roller app-text/evince}}
