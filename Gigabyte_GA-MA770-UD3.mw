lm_sensors doesn't know this chipset, so its voltage values will be wrong.

=== Known hardware issues ===

* The ethernet chip may forget its speed over a suspend and default to 100Mbit after resume. To work around this, put {{c|ethtool -s eth0 speed 1000}} in the appropriate place in your suspend scripts.
* Most AMD family 10h CPUs have a processor erratum related to the temperature sensor's unreliability, which is why the driver is disabled above.
* The SB700 chipset is affected by a kernel quirk that prevents it using message-signalled interrupts due to the possibility of data corruption when a floppy drive is used. There's [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-905708.html|a patch on the Gentoo forums] (updated version [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7874714.html#7874714|here]) to disable the kernel's workarounds, which may or may not improve performance slightly.
