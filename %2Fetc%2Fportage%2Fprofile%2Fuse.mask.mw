Some USE flags do not make sense on certain architectures (for example the <code>altivec</code> flag on a non-PPC architecture or the <code>mmx</code> on a non-{{Keyword|x86}} system). Other times certain USE flag configurations have not yet been tested. Here the masked ones USE flags are masked. The {{Path|use.mask}} file is available to mask configurations that could potentially break the system.

{{Note|In a cascading profile setup, you can remove USE flags in children profiles which were added by parent profiles by prefixing the flag with a <code>-</code> (minus sign).}}

== Format ==

* Comments begin with <code>#</code> (no inline comments).
* One <var>USE</var> flag value per line.
