'''Under construction'''

==Scope of this document==
Hostapd can do a '''lot''' of things, but only its most basic aspects will be covered here.<br/>
Links are available at the end for more advanced setups.

==Requirement==
The only thing needed is a Wi-Fi card supporting the "AP Mode".
{{Cmd|iw list &#124; grep "Supported interface modes" -A 8|output=<pre>
        Supported interface modes:
                 * IBSS
                 * managed
                 * AP
                 * AP/VLAN
                 * WDS
                 * monitor
                 * P2P-client
                 * P2P-GO

</pre>}}
If ''AP'' is present, then the card can be used as an Access Point.

===Bands===
There are 2 bands: 2.4GHz and 5GHz
====2.4GHz====
Used by: 802.11b/g/n
Channels: 11 to 14
Interferences: high because of popularity
====5GHz====
Used by: 802.11a/n/ac
Channels: around 20, varies a lot from country to country
Interferences: low

===Access Point===
An access point is like a wireless switch
An AP can only use one band at a time: 2.4GHz OR 5GHz, a so-called "dual-band AP" is just one AP at 2.4GHz plus one at 5GHz
An AP using the 2.4GHz band can be b, g and n at the same time (if the hardware supports it)
An AP using the 5GHz band can be a, n and ac at the same time (if the hardware supports it)
An AP can have multiple SSIDs, making it look like multiple APs, but all will share the same band AND channel

==Capabilities of Hostapd==
===What Hostapd can do===
* Create an AP
* Create multiple APs on the same card (if the card supports it, usually up to 8)
* Create one AP on one card and another AP on a second card, all within a single instance of Hostapd
===What Hostapd cannot do===
* Use 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz at the same time on the same card. Two cards would be needed for that. Even if a card is dual-band it can't use both ''at the same time''
* Create multiple APs on different channels on the same card. Multiple APs on the same card use the same channel (without any problems)
* Create a dual-band AP, even with two cards. But there can be two APs with the same SSID, one on 2.4GHz and one on 5.8GHz
