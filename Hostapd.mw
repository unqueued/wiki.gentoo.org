'''Under construction'''

==Scope of this document==
Hostapd can do a '''lot''' of things, but only its most basic aspects will be covered here.<br/>
Links are available at the end for more advanced setups.

==Requirement==
The only thing needed is a Wi-Fi card supporting the "AP Mode".
{{Cmd|iw list &#124; grep "Supported interface modes" -A 8|output=<pre>
        Supported interface modes:
                 * IBSS
                 * managed
                 * AP
                 * AP/VLAN
                 * WDS
                 * monitor
                 * P2P-client
                 * P2P-GO

</pre>}}
If ''AP'' is present, then the card can be used as an Access Point.

==WiFi==
802.11a: 5.8GHz, very old, very slow, not used anymore
802.11b: 2.4GHz, very old, very slow, not used anymore
802.11g: 2.4GHz, old, slow, a few devices still use it
802.11n: 2.4GHz or 5.8GHz, recent, fast, used by nearly all current devices, note that it can only use one band at a time, '''not both at the same time'''
802.11ac: 5.8GHz, brand new, very fast, little adoption for now but new devices will support it



==Capabilities of Hostapd==
===What Hostapd can do===
* Create an AP
* Create multiple APs on the same card (if the card supports it, usually up to 8)
* Create one AP on one card and another AP on a second card, all within a single instance of Hostapd
===What Hostapd cannot do===
* Use 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz at the same time on the same card. Two cards would be needed for that. Even if a card is dual-band it can't use both ''at the same time''
* Create multiple APs on different channels on the same card. Multiple APs on the same card use the same channel (without any problems)
* Create a dual-band AP, even with two cards. But there can be two APs with the same SSID, one on 2.4GHz and one on 5.8GHz

==Sample configurations==
