'''Under construction'''

==Scope of this document==
Hostapd can do a '''lot''' of things, but only its most basic aspects will be covered here.<br/>
Links are available at the end for more advanced setups.

==Requirement==
The only thing needed is a Wi-Fi card supporting the "AP Mode".
{{Cmd|iw list &#124; grep "Supported interface modes" -A 8|output=<pre>
        Supported interface modes:
                 * IBSS
                 * managed
                 * AP
                 * AP/VLAN
                 * WDS
                 * monitor
                 * P2P-client
                 * P2P-GO

</pre>}}
If ''AP'' is present, then the card can be used as an Access Point.

==Sample configurations==
===802.11bgn with WPA2-PSK===
A simple but secure AP with maximal compatibility for current hardware<br/>
Encryption: WPA2-PSK with CCMP and TKIP<br/>
Compatibility: 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n<br/>
