==Scope of this document==
Hostapd can do a '''lot''' of things, but only its most basic aspects will be covered here.<br/>

==Requirement==
A WiFi card with '''AP''' mode support is needed
{{Cmd|iw list {{!}} grep "Supported interface modes" -A 8|output=<pre>
        Supported interface modes:
                 * IBSS
                 * managed
                 * AP
                 * AP/VLAN
                 * WDS
                 * monitor
                 * P2P-client
                 * P2P-GO

===Access Point===
* An AP is like a wireless switch
* An AP can only use one band at a time: 2.4GHz OR 5GHz, a so-called "dual-band AP" is just one AP at 2.4GHz plus one at 5GHz
* An AP using the 2.4GHz band can be b, g and n at the same time (if the hardware supports it)
* An AP using the 5GHz band can be a, n and ac at the same time (if the hardware supports it)
* An AP can have multiple SSIDs, making it look like multiple APs, but all will share the same band AND channel

==Capabilities of Hostapd==
===What it can do===
* Create an AP
* Create multiple APs on the same card (if the card supports it, usually up to 8)
* Create one AP on one card and another AP on a second card, all within a single instance of Hostapd
===What it cannot do===
* Use 2.4GHz and 5GHz at the same time on the same card. Even if a card is dual-band it can't use both ''at the same time''
* Create multiple APs on different channels on the same card. Multiple APs on the same card will share the same channel
* Create a dual-band AP, even with two cards. But it can create two APs with the same SSID
* Assign IPs to the devices connecting to the AP, a dhcp server is needed for that
* Assign an IP to the AP itself, it is not hostapd's job to do that

==IP, DHCP and Routing==
Hostapd only creates wireless ethernet switchs, it does not even know about the IP protocol or routing<br/>
===IP of the AP===
An AP's interface really is just an ethernet interface
{{File|/etc/conf.d/net|Sample network configuration for an AP|<pre>
(...)
rc_net_wlan0_modules="!iwconfig !wpa_supplicant" # by default wireless interfaces are assumed to be clients, not APs
config_wlan0="192.168.42.1/24"                   # the AP's IP and network
rc_net_wlan0_need="hostapd"                      # ensures the interface is [re]configured after hostapd [re]starts
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd
|ln -s net.lo /etc/init.d/net.wlan0
|rc-update add net.wlan0 default
}}

===DHCP===
A DHCP server listening on the AP's interface will provide the AP's clients with IPs

===Routing===
Nothing special about routing an AP, it behaves exactly like an ethernet interface

==Sample configurations==
===802.11b/g/n with WPA2-PSK and CCMP===
A simple but secure AP with maximal compatibility for current hardware<br/>
{{File|/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf||<pre>
interface=wlan0       # the interface used by the AP
hw_mode=g             # g simply means 2.4GHz band
channel=10            # the channel to use
ieee80211d=1          # limit the frequencies used to those allowed in the country
country_code=FR       # the country code
ieee80211n=1          # 802.11n support
wmm_enabled=1         # QoS support

ssid=somename         # the name of the AP
auth_algs=1           # 1=wpa, 2=wep, 3=both
wpa=2                 # WPA2 only
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
wpa_passphrase=somepassword
</pre>}}

===802.11a/n/ac with WPA2-PSK and CCMP===
A simple but secure AP for recent hardware<br/>
{{File|/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf||<pre>
interface=wlan0       # the interface used by the AP
hw_mode=a             # a simply means 5GHz
channel=0             # the channel to use, 0 means the AP will search for the channel with the least interferences 
ieee80211d=1          # limit the frequencies used to those allowed in the country
country_code=FR       # the country code
ieee80211n=1          # 802.11n support
ieee80211ac=1         # 802.11ac support
wmm_enabled=1         # QoS support

ssid=somename         # the name of the AP
auth_algs=1           # 1=wpa, 2=wep, 3=both
wpa=2                 # WPA2 only
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK 
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
wpa_passphrase=somepassword
</pre>}}

===802.11b/g/n triple AP===
Three APs on the same card, one with WPA2, one with WPA1, one without encryption<br/>
Hostapd automaticaly creates new interfaces for the extra APs
{{File|/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf||<pre>
interface=wlan0       # the interface used by the AP
hw_mode=g             # g simply means 2.4GHz
channel=10            # the channel to use
ieee80211d=1          # limit the frequencies used to those allowed in the country
country_code=FR       # the country code
ieee80211n=1          # 802.11n support
wmm_enabled=1         # QoS support

# First AP
ssid=test1            # the name of the AP
auth_algs=1           # 1=wpa, 2=wep, 3=both
wpa=2                 # WPA2 only
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK 
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
wpa_passphrase=somepassword

# Seconf AP
bss=wlan1             # the name of the new interface hostapd will create to handle this AP 
ssid=test2            # the name of the AP
auth_algs=1           # 1=wpa, 2=wep, 3=both
wpa=1                 # WPA1 only
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK 
wpa_passphrase=someotherpassword

# Third AP
bss=wlan2             # the name of the new interface hostapd will create to handle this AP 
ssid=test3
# since there is no encryption defined, none will be used
</pre>}}

==Troubleshooting== 
802.11ac support is not activated in the latest ebuild (2.2)

DFS support, a.k.a radar detection, is missing for most drivers, this means the 5GHz band is completely unusable in countries who require DFS on all the channels<br/>
