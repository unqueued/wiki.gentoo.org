This article is written for the Logitech G15 but it should work with other keyboards in the G-series produced by Logitech.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

To be able to use g15daemon used in this article you need to compile your kernel with uinput support.

{{KernelBox|1=
Device Drivers --> 
   Input Device support --> 
      [*] Miscellaneous devices --> 
          <*> User level driver support
}}

=== Portage ===

To get other applications to know about the G15 keyboard, add the following to {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
LCD_DEVICES="g15"
USE="g15 lcd"
}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-misc/g15daemon}} for the multimedia keys and LCD display, and {{Package|app-misc/g15macro}} for the {{Key|M^}} and {{Key|G^}} keys.

{{Emerge|app-misc/g15daemon app-misc/g15macro}}

== Configuration ==

After installing g15daemon and g15macro, check the g15daemon configuration file before starting the service. Normally the default values should work.

{{Note|Note the 24-hour clock format in {{Path|/etc/g15daemon.conf}}}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/g15daemon.conf|1=
# G15Daemon Configuration File
# any items entered before a [section] header
# will be in the Global config space
# comments you wish to keep should start with a semicolon';'

[Global]

}}

=== Xorg ===

Optionally add the following to {{Path|/etc/X11/[[xorg.conf]]}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf|lang=xorg.conf|1=
Option         "XkbModel" "logitech_g15"
}}

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

Configure the g15daemon service configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/g15daemon|lang=bash|1=
# Key to switch the client-screens. Default is the MR key,
# Set to "yes" to use L1 key instead (black round key below the LCD, above the multimedia keys).
CLIENT_SWITCH_L1="no"

# Set to "yes" to switch off the lcd backlight when stopping g15daemon.
BACKLIGHT_OFF="no"
}}

To start g15daemon:

{{RootCmd|rc-service g15daemon start}}

To start g15daemon at boot:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add g15daemon default}}

If everything worked correctly a clock should be visible on the G15 LCD display.

== Usage ==

=== Multimedia keys ===

To have the new keys working in X11, create a specific xmodmap in your home directory or edit an existing one.

Create the xmodmap:

{{Cmd|cp /usr/share/g15daemon/contrib/xmodmaprc ~/.Xmodmap}}

Adding keycodes to an existing xmodmap:

{{Cmd|cat /usr/share/g15daemon/contrib/xmodmaprc >> ~/.Xmodmap}}

To get the new keys you might need to restart your session or run:

{{Cmd|xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap}}

To check if your keys have been mapped correctly you can test them with {{Package|x11-apps/xev}}.

=== G & M keys ===

To get your {{Key|G^}} and {{Key|M^}} keys to work you need to start up g15macro, preferably you should make it start automatically with the rest of your desktop.

{{Cmd|/usr/bin/g15macro &}}

Your extra keys should now be working and you should be able to record macro keys by pushing the {{Key|MR}} key.
