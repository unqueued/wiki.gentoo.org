This article is written for the Logitech G15 but it should work with other keyboards in the G-series produced by Logitech.

== Kernel configuration ==
To be able to use g15daemon used in this article you need to compile your kernel with uinput support

{{KernelBox|
Device Drivers -> 
   Input Device support -> 
      [*] Miscellaneous devices -> 
          <*> User level driver support
}}

== make.conf ==
To get other applications to know about your G15 keyboard you should add the following to your make.conf

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|<nowiki>
LCD_DEVICES="g15"
USE="g15 lcd"
</nowiki>}}

== G15Daemon / G15Macro ==
To get multimedia keys and LCD panel working properly you will need g15daemon, for the M^ and G^ keys to work you will also need g15macro.
{{Emerge
|app-misc/g15daemon
|app-misc/g15macro
}}

After installing g15daemon and g15macro you should check out the following files before starting anything, normally default values works for everyone.
{{Note|Note the 24-hour clock format in g15daemon.conf}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/g15daemon|<nowiki>
# Key to switch the client-screens. Default is the MR key,
# Set to "yes" to use L1 key instead (black round key below the LCD, above the multimedia keys).
CLIENT_SWITCH_L1="no"

# Set to "yes" to switch off the lcd backlight when stopping g15daemon.
BACKLIGHT_OFF="no"
</nowiki> }}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/g15daemon.conf|<nowiki>
# G15Daemon Configuration File
# any items entered before a [section] header
# will be in the Global config space
# comments you wish to keep should start with a semicolon';'

[Global]
Use MR as Cycle Key: Off

[PLUGIN_LOAD_ORDER]

1: g15plugin_clock.so
2: g15plugin_tcpserver.so

[Keyboard OS Mapping (uinput)]
device: /dev/input/uinput

[Clock]

</nowiki>}}

When finished you can start the g15daemon with
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/g15daemon start}}

And add it to start up as default with
{{RootCmd|/sbin/rc-update add g15daemon default}}

If everything worked correctly you should now have a clock visible on your LCD-display

=== Multimedia keys ===
To have all new keys working in X11, you'll need create a specific xmodmap in your home directory or edit the existent one.

Create the xmodmap
{{Cmd|cp /usr/share/g15daemon/contrib/xmodmaprc ~/.Xmodmap}}

Adding keycodes to an existing xmodmap:
{{Cmd|cat /usr/share/g15daemon/contrib/xmodmaprc >> ~/.Xmodmap}}

To get the new keys you might need to restart your session or run:
{{Cmd|xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap}}

To check if your keys have been mapped correctly you can test them with {{Package|x11-apps/xev}}

=== G & M keys ===
To get your G^ and M^ keys to work you need to start up g15macro, preferably you should make it start automatically with the rest of your desktop.
{{Cmd|/usr/bin/g15macro &}}

Your extra keys should now be working and you should be able to record macro keys by pushing the MR key.

== Extra ==
Optionally you can add the following to your [[xorg.conf]]:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf|lang=xorg_conf|
Option         "XkbModel" "logitech_g15"
}}
