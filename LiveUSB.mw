Downloading a LiveCD ISO image is the first step in creating a LiveUSB. The architecture appropriate Gentoo Minimal LiveCDs or the Gentoo-based SystemRescueCd are good choices for installing Gentoo. The SystemRescueCD is nice because it supports both 32-bit and 64-bit processors in the same ISO image.

With that being said, almost any modern LiveCD should work for installing Gentoo.

== Creation ==

=== Get the ISO image ===

When downloading, adjust the architecture ({{Keyword|x86}}, {{Keyword|amd64}}, {{Keyword|arm}}, {{Keyword|sparc}}, etc.) portion of the URL to match the system's CPU. The example below is for {{Keyword|x86}} (i686) CPUs.

{{Cmd|<nowiki>wget http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/x86/autobuilds/current-iso/install-x86-minimal-20130528.iso</nowiki>}}

=== Convert the ISO image to hybrid mode ===

Most modern LiveCD's, like Gentoo are already in hybrid mode. If the LiveUSB does not boot, then it will have to be converted to hybrid mode. Hybrid mode means image will enable the ISO to boot from both a CD-ROM device ''or'' a USB drive.

Convert the ISO with the following command:

{{RootCmd|isohybrid filename.iso}}

The {{c|isohybrid}} command comes as part of the {{Package|sys-boot/syslinux}} package.

=== Write the ISO image to a USB drive ===

Write the ISO image to a USB drive using the {{c|dd}} utility:

{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}install-x86-minimal-20130528.iso of{{=}}/dev/sdb bs{{=}}4M}}

The {{c|dd}} utility will not return any progress output on standard output (it can provide some progress output, but not without some finagling). The command will exit without any errors (no output) when it completes the transfer successfully. Depending on the size of the ISO image and the speed of the USB device, this process could some time. Be patient!

Once complete, the USB drive should be bootable.

=== Boot via the system's firmware interface ===

When attempting to boot from a USB device, be sure to select or enable USB drives as bootable devices in the system's firmware interface. If the ISO is UEFI capable, it may be necessary to enable booting UEFI devices as well. This is typically performed via toggle options in the [[BIOS]] or [[UEFI]] firmware interface.

While in the system's firmware interface the boot order may need to be adjusted for USB devices to boot first, although it usually easier to hit the appropriate key (usually {{Key|F2}} or {{Key|Delete}}) in order to manually select the USB device as a one-time boot option from the bootable devices list.
