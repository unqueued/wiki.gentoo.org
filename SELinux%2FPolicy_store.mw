A policy store contains the SELinux policy package and system administrator modifications combined in a single, logical entity. Multiple stores can be used on a system, allowing administrators to have separate SELinux policies which can be switched (either directly or after reboot).

== Introduction ==

=== Policy store location ===

The policy store is located in {{Path|/etc/selinux}} in a subdirectory called after the policy store.

Pre-defined policy stores are ''strict'', ''targeted'', ''mcs'' and ''mls'', but this can be fully configured by the administrator.

=== Policy differentiation ===

By allowing multiple policy stores, administrators can support different policies on a single system.

For instance, an administrator might have both ''strict'' and ''mcs'' available. The ''strict'' policy does not support MLS, whereas ''mcs'' does (but with a single security level).
