A policy store contains the SELinux policy package and system administrator modifications combined in a single, logical entity. Multiple stores can be used on a system, allowing administrators to have separate SELinux policies which can be switched (either directly or after reboot).

== Introduction ==

=== Policy store location ===

The policy store is located in {{Path|/etc/selinux}} in a subdirectory called after the policy store.

Pre-defined policy stores are ''strict'', ''targeted'', ''mcs'' and ''mls'', but this can be fully configured by the administrator.

=== Policy differentiation ===

By allowing multiple policy stores, administrators can support different policies on a single system.

For instance, an administrator might have both ''strict'' and ''mcs'' available. The ''strict'' policy does not support MLS, whereas ''mcs'' does (but with a single security level).

=== Active policy store ===

The active policy store is configured in {{Path|/etc/selinux/config}} through the <code>SELINUXTYPE</code> variable:

{{File|/etc/selinux/config|Active store declaration|<pre>
# SELINUXTYPE can take one of these four values:
#       targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected.
#       strict   - Full SELinux protection.
#       mls      - Full SELinux protection with Multi-Level Security
#       mcs      - Full SELinux protection with Multi-Category Security 
#                  (mls, but only one sensitivity level)
SELINUXTYPE=strict
</pre>}}

== Gentoo integration ==

=== POLICY_TYPES in make.conf ===

The policy stores that need to be maintained on a Gentoo system are covered by the <code>POLICY_TYPES</code> variable.

By default, this variable is defined in the Gentoo profile and set as follows:

{{Code|Default POLICY_TYPES declaration|<pre>
POLICY_TYPES="strict targeted"
</pre>}}

The variable can be overridden through the {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} file.
