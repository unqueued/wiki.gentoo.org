'''Enlightenment''' is a light-weight and eye-candy desktop environment.

== Enlightenment versions ==

There seems to be a confusion over enlightenment versions. There's the git repository with what would later become version 0.20. Then there's a released version 0.19 which seems to have it's own outdated page [[E19]]. And there are the older versions 0.18 and 0.17, the latter being still very popular for its stability and is still the latest version in Gentoo.

There is also an even older version called E16 whose apparent version in Gentoo is 1.x, which unfortunately makes it appear newer than E17 and later. Because of that, you need to be careful which version you are installing.

== Installing Enlightenment 0.17  ==
For installing Enlightenment and the needed libraries, just issue the following command:
{{Emerge|enlightenment:0.17}}

For svg support e.g. for previews or menu entries, you can additionally install evas_generic_loaders with the svg USE flag enabled.
Addition to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} (unless you already have the svg USE flag globally enabled):
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use||
media-plugins/evas_generic_loaders svg
}}
and install the package:
{{Emerge|evas_generic_loaders}}

== Instaling Enlightenment 0.18 ==

At the time of writing, you need to install E18 from testing.

{{Emerge|{{=}}x11-wm/enlightenment-0.18.8}}

== Installing Enlightenment live ebuilds (future 0.20 release) ==

Make sure you have installed [[Layman]]. Now you can add the [http://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays/ixit ixit] overlay.

{{RootCmd|layman -a ixit}}

Make sure to install all core enlightenment packages using live ebuilds. You can update using the exact same command to ensure that all core packages are updated.

{{Emerge|--autounmask-write @enlightenment-core-9999}}

If anything goes wrong, contact [[User:Pavlix]]. Those are live ebuilds and therefore they can occasionally need updating. I'm also considering starting a separate overlay just for Enlightenment, let me know if that would help you.

== Tips and Tricks ==
Now one can start Enlightenment desktop environment by launching the default display manager.

You may have to add an entry to your X sessions directory, if you use [[SLiM]] for example
{{RootCmd| echo "enlightenment_start" >> /etc/X11/Sessions/Enlightenment}}
{{RootCmd| chmod +x /etc/X11/Sessions/Enlightenment}}

Or else, one can use simple {{Path|<nowiki>~/.{xinitrc,bash_log{in,out}}</nowiki>}} or [[zsh]] version {{Path|<nowiki>~/.zlog{in,out}</nowiki>}} scheme to avoid unnecessary extra packages to just be able to log into your session. And do not forget to install [[NetworkManager]] and {{Package|gnome-extra/nm-applet}} or else a light weight network manager like [[Dhcpcd]]+[[Dhcpcd-ui]] or even {{Package|net-misc/connman}} which have a EFL applet.

    startx 1>~/.log/xsession-errors 2>&1 &
...</pre>}}
A zsh version could be used instead.
{{File|[https://github.com/tokiclover/dotfiles/blob/master/.zlogin ~/.zlogin]||<pre>
# $Header: ~/.zlogin, 2014/11/22 Exp $
...
# auto startx depending on the tty
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && [[ $EUID != 0 ]] && [[ ${$(tty)#*tty} -le 3 ]] {
    startx 1>~/.log/xsession-errors 2>&1 &
}
...
# vim:fenc=utf-8:ci:pi:sts=0:sw=4:ts=4</pre>}}

The previous files can be used to login into an Enlightenment session easily without needing any ''middle man'' like {{Package|x11-misc/slim}} depending on tty or console used to log in. Adapt to youy needs and window manager.
