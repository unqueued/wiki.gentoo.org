'''Enlightenment''' is [[Article description::an eye-candy, compositing and stacking [[window manager]] that is released under the permissive BSD License.]] It was first released in 1997 by Carsten Haitzler (Rasterman) and this original release was dubbed Enlightenment DR16 (or E16 for short). In 2012 a new version of Enlightenment was released, which was called Enlightenment DR17 (or E17). Since then many further major releases of Enlightenment have been made: E18, E19, E20, E21 and E22. E20, E21 and E22  are all presently in the Portage Tree. 

There has been some confusion over Enlightenment versions. E16, despite being an older release of Enlightenment, has its releases numbered 1.x, while the later releases of Enlightenment (E17-E22) all have decimal release numbers. E17 is numbered 0.17.x, E18 is numbered 0.18.x, E19 is numbered 0.19.x while E20 is numbered 0.20.x and so on. Consequently, it is advised that users are careful as to which version of Enlightenment they are installing. While the version numbers reflect actual versions of the upstream tar archives, they can be confusing.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-wm/enlightenment}}

All wayland-related modules should be either disabled or enabled, depending on your <code>wayland</code> USE flag status.

{{Important|Upstream requires <code>systemd</code> to be used when enabling <code>wayland</code>, see [https://git.enlightenment.org/core/enlightenment.git/tree/README.wayland Wayland requirements].}} 

=== Latest Enlightenment  ===

For installing the latest Enlightenment WM and the needed libraries, just issue the following command:

{{Emerge|enlightenment}}

For SVG support e.g. for previews or menu entries, you can additionally install dev-libs/efl with the <code>svg</code> USE flag enabled.

Addition to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} (unless you already have the <code>svg</code> USE flag globally enabled) and install the package:

{{RootCmd|euse -p dev-libs/efl -E svg}}

{{Emerge|efl}}

=== Enlightenment 0.21 ===

To get the latest release of Enlightenment-E21, type

{{Emerge|{{=}}x11-wm/enlightenment-0.21.11}}

and mask later releases if you don't wish to receive E22+ updates using {{Path|/etc/portage/package.mask}}.

=== Enlightenment 0.20 ===

At the time of writing the latest stable release of Enlightenment is E20. You will get it automatically when using a stable system and typing

{{Emerge|enlightenment}}

Otherwise, you can utilize {{Path|/etc/portage/package.mask}} again.

=== Enlightenment live ebuilds ===

The process is a little different because it's recommended to always rebuild all of the components using their current state in [[Git]]. Make sure you have installed [[Layman]] or [[Eselect/Repository]]. Now you can add the [http://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays/enlightenment-live enlightenment-live] overlay.

{{RootCmd|layman -a enlightenment-live}}

or

{{RootCmd|eselect repository enable enlightenment-live}}

Make sure to install all core enlightenment packages using live ebuilds. You can update using the exact same command to ensure that all core packages are updated.

{{Emerge|--autounmask-write @enlightenment-core-9999}}

The overlay contains masked package even for latest stable enlightenment releases.

Be aware that they are currently masked for ~amd64, so you need to unmask them.
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --autounmask-write efl enlightenment}}

{{Note|The ebuilds are currently tested for X and not for Wayland. Further investigation and feedback is needed for Enlightenment with Wayland and Systemd}} 
{{Note|The ebuilds for the latest stable packages may be moved to the official repository once tested and stable.}} 

If anything goes wrong, file a ticket on GitHub or contact [[User:Rafspiny]]. Those are live ebuilds and therefore they can occasionally need updating. I'm also considering starting a separate overlay just for Enlightenment, let me know if that would help you.

=== Enlightenment e16 ===

Old Enlightenment-e16 is still maintained. It was removed from Gentoo's portage tree because it caused a lot of confusion and made later Enlightenment releases harder to handle due to wrongly slotted packages. You can install e16 from [https://github.com/mcclung/e16-overlay e16-overlay]. Please report any issues you find with e16 to the maintainer of that overlay via [https://github.com/mcclung/e16-overlay/issues Github issues].

{{Note|Update this section when the overlay gets added to public layman / eselect-repository list.}}

== Configuration ==

=== Enlightenment ===

Enlightenment's configuration is all handled through the settings editor from within enlightenment. You can access some "under-the-hood" config options with

{{Cmd|elementary_config}} 

And there's also a command line tool called <code>vieet</code> which especially useful in emergency. In many cases, if your Enlightenment's configuration gets broken, moving {{Path|~/.e}} and {{Path|~/.elementary}} to a temporary place, then re-starting Enlightenment usually helps.

=== Launching enlightenment with startx ===

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session enlightenment_start
}}

== Tips and tricks ==

Now one can start Enlightenment desktop environment by launching the default Display Manager (DM).

You may have to add an entry to your X sessions directory, if you use [[SLiM]] for example
{{RootCmd| echo "enlightenment_start" >> /etc/X11/Sessions/Enlightenment}}
{{RootCmd| chmod +x /etc/X11/Sessions/Enlightenment}}

Or else, opt for a DM free set up.
See [[X without Display Manager#Multiple X Session/Virtual_Console]] for more info on starting a X Session without a DM.

And do not forget to install [[NetworkManager]] and {{Package|gnome-extra/nm-applet}} or else a light weight network manager like [[Network_management_using_DHCPCD|Dhcpcd]]+[[Dhcpcd-ui]] or even {{Package|net-misc/connman}} for which there is an Enlightenment applet.

== EFL-based applications ==

[https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-libs/efl EFL] and [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-python/python-efl python-efl] offer developers everything needed to develop eye-candy applications that integrate into Enlightenment WM. Here are few of them, 

* [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/media-gfx/ephoto media-gfx/ephoto] Enlightenment image viewer written with EFL 
* [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-process/evisum sys-process/evisum] System and process monitor written with EFL 
* [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/x11-terms/terminology x11-terms/terminology] Feature rich terminal emulator

{{Note|Anyone can add software they use via [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Proxy_Maintainers the proxy-maint project]. Please do so.}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Black window contents ===

If you get windows with completely black contents (most likely with the nvidia proprietary driver and Enlightenment 0.20.5 or 0.20.6), follow these steps:
* log out from Xorg.
* set E_COMP_ENGINE=sw, for example in .xinitrc:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
export E_COMP_ENGINE=sw
exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session enlightenment_start
}}
Alternatively, you can set the variable in /etc/environment.
* start X.
* Go to Settings->Composite->Advanced->Rendering and disable "Texture from pixmap".
* Then you can remove "export E_COMP_ENGINE=sw" from .xinitrc and log out/in to get accelerated rendering again.

For more information see [https://phab.enlightenment.org/T3030 this bug report].

=== "build error: undefined symbol: _EFL_GFX_PATH_CHANGED" ===

An unfortunate build error that's caused by existing libraries. There is usually a more detailed error, like: "/usr/lib64/libector.so.1: undefined symbol: _EFL_GFX_PATH_CHANGED". In this case, remove any existing installation of dev-libs/efl and the offending library. 

{{Important|It's wise to log out from Enlightenment before removing efl. Removing efl while using Enlightenment might cause Enlightenment to act weirdly and in the worst case lock up. If that happens, you won't see if the build fails. Log in to TTY or some other WM/DE while re-installing efl.}}

{{RootCmd|emerge -C --nodeps dev-libs/efl}}
{{RootCmd|rm /usr/lib64/libector.so.1}}
{{Emerge|dev-libs/efl}}

See more in [https://bugs.gentoo.org/651890 #651890].

=== Debugging ===

If you've tried to move your config files away and Enlightenment still doesn't work, you can debug the problem by typing 

{{Cmd|<nowiki>enlightenment_start 2>&1 | tee logthing.txt</nowiki>}}

and reading the log file. It is useful when making a bug report to [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ bugs.gentoo.org] or upstream's [https://phab.enlightenment.org/project/ Phabricator]. If the log file doesn't imply clear errors, you might have to install and run it it with debugging tools like [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-devel/gdb gdb], [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-util/strace strace] or [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-util/valgrind valgrind].

{{Cmd|<nowiki>E_START=1 strace enlightenment_start 2>&1 | tee logthing.txt</nowiki>}}

=== "No opengl engines found" with nvidia-drivers ===

With latest releases of mesa and xorg-1.20, [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-libs/efl efl] can look for {{Path|libGL.so }} from a wrong place. This results in Enlightenment's gl-engine not using opengl backend. This can be fixed with [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-util/patchelf patchelf] utility. 

Identify where your {{Path|libGL.so}} is installed, usually {{Path|/usr/lib/opengl/nvidia/lib/libGL.so}}. Then use patchelf to modify [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-libs/efl efl]'s gl engine, 

{{Cmd|patchelf --set-rpath /usr/lib/opengl/nvidia/lib/ /usr/lib64/evas/modules/engines/gl_x11/v-1.20/module.so}}

And relog. Paths depend on your architechture. This needs to be done once, or everytime [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-libs/efl efl] is re-installed.
