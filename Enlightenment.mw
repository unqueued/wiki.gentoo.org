'''Enlightenment''' is a light-weight and eye-candy desktop environment.

There seems to be a confusion over enlightenment versions. There's the git repository with what would later become version 0.20 (or E20). The latest released version is 0.19 (or E19). There are older versions E18 and E17, the latter being still very popular for its stability and is still the latest stable version in Gentoo. Various dependencies (notably {{Package|dev-libs/efl}}) have their own versioning schemes and often you can build multiple different versions of {{Package|x11-wm/enlightenment}} against a single version of {{Package|dev-libs/efl}}. If unsure, follow the instructions for individual versions later in this page.

There is also an even older version called E16 whose apparent version in Gentoo is 1.x, which unfortunately makes it appear newer than E17 and later. Because of that, you need to be careful which version you are installing. While the version numbers reflect actual versions of the upstream tarballs, it's very confusing.

== Installation ==

=== Enlightenment 0.17  ===

For installing Enlightenment and the needed libraries, just issue the following command:
{{Emerge|enlightenment:0.17}}

For svg support e.g. for previews or menu entries, you can additionally install evas_generic_loaders with the svg USE flag enabled.
Addition to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} (unless you already have the svg USE flag globally enabled) and install the package:

{{RootCmd|euse -p media-plugins/evas_generic_loaders -E svg}}

{{Emerge|evas_generic_loaders}}

=== Enlightenment 0.18 ===

At the time of writing, you need to install E18 from testing.

{{Emerge|x11-wm/enlightenment:0.17/0.18.8}}

=== Enlightenment 0.19 (using ixit overlay) ===

Make sure you have installed [[Layman]]. Now you can add the [http://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays/ixit ixit] overlay.

{{RootCmd|layman -a ixit}}

Now you can install Enlightenment 0.19.

{{Emerge|x11-wm/enlightenment:0.17/0.19}}

For any issues, contact [[User:Pavlix]].

=== Enlightenment 0.19 (using enlightenment-niifaq overlay) ===

If you have yet to already, emerge layman with git support:
{{RootCmd|emerge layman}}
Then add the overlay:
{{RootCmd|layman -o 'http://git.niifaq.ru/enlightenment-niifaq/plain/Documentation/layman/enlightenment-niifaq.xml' -f -k -a enlightenment-niifaq}}
If this is the first overlay you've ever added:
{{RootCmd|echo 'source /var/lib/layman/make.conf' >> /etc/make.conf}}

For a pure installation with no additional apps or themes:
{{Emerge|@enlightenment}}
To pull in some themes and e-apps as well:
{{Emerge|@enlightenment-extended}}

Known issues:

* [https://phab.enlightenment.org/T1612 enlightenment_fm eats up CPU and RAM]

=== Enlightenment live ebuilds (future 0.20 release) ===

The process is a little different because it's recommended to always rebuild all of the components using their current state in [[Git]]. Make sure you have installed [[Layman]]. Now you can add the [http://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays/ixit ixit] overlay.

{{RootCmd|layman -a ixit}}

Make sure to install all core enlightenment packages using live ebuilds. You can update using the exact same command to ensure that all core packages are updated.

{{Emerge|--autounmask-write @enlightenment-core-9999}}

If anything goes wrong, contact [[User:Pavlix]]. Those are live ebuilds and therefore they can occasionally need updating. I'm also considering starting a separate overlay just for Enlightenment, let me know if that would help you.

== Configuration ==

=== Enlightenment ===
Enlightenment's configuration is all handled through the settings editor from within enlightenment. There's also a command line tool called <code>vieet</code>, especially useful in emergency.

=== Launching enlightenment with startx ===
{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>
exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session enlightenment_start
</pre>}}

=== Entrance ===
Once entrance is set up, themes and such can be managed from within entrance.
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
DISPLAYMANAGER="entrance"
</pre>}}
{{File|/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc||<pre>
#!/bin/sh

userresources=$HOME/.Xresources
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
sysresources=/etc/X11/xinit/Xresources
sysmodmap=/etc/X11/xinit/Xmodmap
# merge in defaults and keymaps

if [ -f $sysresources ]; then
    xrdb -merge $sysresources
fi

if [ -f $sysmodmap ]; then
    xmodmap $sysmodmap
fi

if [ -f "$userresources" ]; then
    xrdb -merge "$userresources"
fi

if [ -f "$usermodmap" ]; then
    xmodmap "$usermodmap"
fi

# start some nice programs
if [ -n "`/etc/X11/chooser.sh`" ]; then
        command="`/etc/X11/chooser.sh`"
else
        failsafe="yes"
fi

if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ] ; then
        for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/?* ; do
                [ -x "$f" ] && . "$f"
        done
        unset f
fi

if [ -n "$failsafe" ]; then
        exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session enlightenment_start
else
        exec $command
fi
</pre>}}

== Tips and Tricks ==
Now one can start Enlightenment desktop environment by launching the default display manager.

You may have to add an entry to your X sessions directory, if you use [[SLiM]] for example
{{RootCmd| echo "enlightenment_start" >> /etc/X11/Sessions/Enlightenment}}
{{RootCmd| chmod +x /etc/X11/Sessions/Enlightenment}}

Or else, one can use simple {{Path|<nowiki>~/.{xinitrc,bash_log{in,out}}</nowiki>}} or [[zsh]] version {{Path|<nowiki>~/.zlog{in,out}</nowiki>}} scheme to avoid unnecessary extra packages to just be able to log into your session. And do not forget to install [[NetworkManager]] and {{Package|gnome-extra/nm-applet}} or else a light weight network manager like [[Dhcpcd]]+[[Dhcpcd-ui]] or even {{Package|net-misc/connman}} which have a EFL applet.

# auto startx depending on the tty
if [[ -z "$DISPLAY" ]] && (( $EUID != 0 )); then
	TTY=$(tty)
	[[ "${TTY/tty}" != "$TYY" ]] && (( ${TTY:8:1} <= 3 )) &&
		startx 1>~/.log/xsession-errors 2>&1 &
	unset TTY
fi
...</pre>}}
A zsh version could be used instead.
{{File|[https://github.com/tokiclover/dotfiles/blob/master/.zlogin ~/.zlogin]||<pre>
# $Header: ~/.zlogin, 2014/11/30 Exp $
...
# auto startx depending on the tty
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && (( $EUID != 0 )) {
	[[ ${TTY/tty} != $TTY ]] && (( ${TTY:8:1} <= 3 )) &&
		startx 1>~/.log/xsession-errors 2>&1 &
}
...
# vim:fenc=utf-8:ci:pi:sts=0:sw=4:ts=4</pre>}}

The previous files can be used to login into an Enlightenment session without needing any ''middle man'' {{Package|x11-misc/slim}} depending on tty or console used to log in. Adapts to your needs and window manager.

== Multi Layout Keyboard ==
For using a multi layout keyboard, install this package:
* {{Package|x11-apps/setxkbmap}}
