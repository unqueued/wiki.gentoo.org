'''Enlightenment''' is a light-weight and eye-candy desktop environment.

There seems to be a confusion over enlightenment versions. There's the git repository with what would later become version 0.20 (or E20). The latest released version is 0.19 (or E19). There are older versions E18 and E17, the latter being still very popular for its stability and is still the latest stable version in Gentoo. Various dependencies (notably {{Package|dev-libs/efl}}) have their own versioning schemes and often you can build multiple different versions of {{Package|x11-wm/enlightenment}} against a single version of {{Package|dev-libs/efl}}. If unsure, follow the instructions for individual versions later in this page.

There is also an even older version called E16 whose apparent version in Gentoo is 1.x, which unfortunately makes it appear newer than E17 and later. Because of that, you need to be careful which version you are installing. While the version numbers reflect actual versions of the upstream tarballs, it's very confusing.

== Installation ==

=== Enlightenment 0.17  ===

For installing Enlightenment and the needed libraries, just issue the following command:
{{Emerge|enlightenment:0.17}}

For svg support e.g. for previews or menu entries, you can additionally install evas_generic_loaders with the svg USE flag enabled.
Addition to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} (unless you already have the svg USE flag globally enabled) and install the package:

{{RootCmd|euse -p media-plugins/evas_generic_loaders -E svg}}

{{Emerge|evas_generic_loaders}}

=== Enlightenment 0.18 ===

At the time of writing, you need to install E18 from testing.

{{Emerge|--autounmask-write x11-wm/enlightenment:0.17/0.18.8}}

=== Enlightenment 0.19 ===

Make sure you have installed [[Layman]]. Now you can add the [http://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays/ixit ixit] overlay.

{{RootCmd|layman -a ixit}}

Now you can install Enlightenment 0.19.

{{Emerge|--autounmask-write x11-wm/enlightenment:0.17/0.19}}

Enlightenment has been recently bumped to 0.19.2 which fixes
an issue causing [https://phab.enlightenment.org/T1612 excessive CPU and RAM consumption]. For any issues, contact
[[User:Pavlix]].

Note: The original E19 page linked to the
enlightenment-niifaq overlay that features
some other packages, you may want to check whether it's up
to date and use it instead. It features
@enlightenment and @enlightenment and @enlightenment-extended
package sets.

=== Enlightenment live ebuilds (future 0.20 release) ===

The process is a little different because it's recommended to always rebuild all of the components using their current state in [[Git]]. Make sure you have installed [[Layman]]. Now you can add the [http://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays/ixit ixit] overlay.

{{RootCmd|layman -a ixit}}

Make sure to install all core enlightenment packages using live ebuilds. You can update using the exact same command to ensure that all core packages are updated.

{{Emerge|--autounmask-write @enlightenment-core-9999}}

If anything goes wrong, contact [[User:Pavlix]]. Those are live ebuilds and therefore they can occasionally need updating. I'm also considering starting a separate overlay just for Enlightenment, let me know if that would help you.

== Configuration ==

=== Enlightenment ===
Enlightenment's configuration is all handled through the settings editor from within enlightenment. There's also a command line tool called <code>vieet</code>, especially useful in emergency.

=== Launching enlightenment with startx ===
{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session enlightenment_start
}}

=== Entrance ===
Once entrance is set up, themes and such can be managed from within entrance.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="entrance"
}}
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh

userresources=$HOME/.Xresources
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
sysresources=/etc/X11/xinit/Xresources
sysmodmap=/etc/X11/xinit/Xmodmap
# merge in defaults and keymaps

if [ -f $sysresources ]; then
    xrdb -merge $sysresources
fi

if [ -f $sysmodmap ]; then
    xmodmap $sysmodmap
fi

if [ -f "$userresources" ]; then
    xrdb -merge "$userresources"
fi

if [ -f "$usermodmap" ]; then
    xmodmap "$usermodmap"
fi

# start some nice programs
if [ -n "`/etc/X11/chooser.sh`" ]; then
        command="`/etc/X11/chooser.sh`"
else
        failsafe="yes"
fi

if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ] ; then
        for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/?* ; do
                [ -x "$f" ] && . "$f"
        done
        unset f
fi

if [ -n "$failsafe" ]; then
        exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session enlightenment_start
else
        exec $command
fi
}}

== Tips and Tricks ==
Now one can start Enlightenment desktop environment by launching the default Display Manager (DM).

You may have to add an entry to your X sessions directory, if you use [[SLiM]] for example
{{RootCmd| echo "enlightenment_start" >> /etc/X11/Sessions/Enlightenment}}
{{RootCmd| chmod +x /etc/X11/Sessions/Enlightenment}}

Or else, opt for a DM free set up.
See [[X without Display Manager#Multiple X Session/Virtual_Console]] for more info on starting a X Session without a DM.

And do not forget to install [[NetworkManager]] and {{Package|gnome-extra/nm-applet}} or else a light weight network manager like [[Dhcpcd]]+[[Dhcpcd-ui]] or even {{Package|net-misc/connman}} for which there is an Enlightenment applet.

== Multi Layout Keyboard ==
For using a multi layout keyboard, install this package:
* {{Package|x11-apps/setxkbmap}}
