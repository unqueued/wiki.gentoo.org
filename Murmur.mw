== Usage ==

=== Gaining SuperUser privileges ===

A SuperUser account is created by default on every instance of a Murmur service. This account is created to assist in administration tasks such as kicking or banning an abusive user or quickly an easily creating new channels. In order to obtain SuperUser privileges, the correct password must be used. The SuperUser password is written to the Murmur log file ({{Path|/var/log/murmur/murmur.log}}). Use any pager program or text edit to view the log (for security reasons the log is only view able for users with root privileges), or simply grep for the line:

{{RootCmd|cat /var/log/murmur/murmur.log {{!}} grep "Password for 'SuperUser'"}}

Once the password has been obtained, use a client to connect to the server as the user called "SuperUser". Instructions on adding SuperUser privileges to other accounts can be found [http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Murmurguide#Becoming_Administrator_and_Registering_a_User here on the Mumble wiki].
