===Dependencies===
Since 2010 we have two virtual ebuilds in the tree which consumers of tex/latex should depend on (see also {{Bug|195894}}).
The usually required {{package|virtuals/latex-base}} and {{package|virtuals/tex-base}}, which is in the tree for completeness but hardly needed.

WIP below

====If package needs LaTeX to compile manuals====
(Example: {{package|app-doc/kicad-doc}})

====If a TeX gui needs LaTeX to compile user documents====
(Example: {{package|app-office/texstudio}})

====If a package requires LaTeX for extra features====
(Example: {{package|media-gfx/inkscape}})
Depend on the specific packages which are required for the feature.
