===Dependencies===
We have two virtual ebuilds in the tree which consumers of tex/latex should depend on (see also {{Bug|195894}}).
The usually required {{package|virtual/latex-base}} and {{package|virtual/tex-base}}, which is in the tree for completeness but hardly needed.

==== Run time dependencies for packages like TeX editors and GUIs ====
If a package requires (La)TeX at runtime, but we do not know what the user wants to do with it exactly, it should depend on
{{package|app-text/texlive}}. 

Examples: {{package|app-office/texstudio}}.
{{FileBox|filename=examples/a-tex-gui*.ebuild|lang=bash|1=
RDEPEND="app-text/texlive"
}}

==== Run time dependencies for packages with specific TeX dependencies ====
If a package requires specific TeX packages at runtime, like in a music score editor, which renders a score with LaTeX, 
it should depend on {{package|virtual/tex-base}} plus the specific packages. 

Examples: {{package|media-sound/lilypond}}.
TODO: FILEBOX

==== Build time dependencies for packages like PDF manuals ====
If a package requires TeX only at build time, it should depend on {{package|virtual/latex-base}} and if required also depend on specific tex packages.

Examples: {{package|app-doc/kicad-doc}}.
TODO: FILEBOX

====If a package requires LaTeX for extra features, ====
If a package requires LaTeX say
* for extra features, 
* to compile the manual, 
* or if it is a TeX gui and should be able to compile user documents, then it should
depend on one of the virtual ebuilds.
If additional TeX packages are required, it has to depend on these too.

(Examples: {{package|media-gfx/inkscape}}, {{package|app-doc/kicad-doc}} or {{package|app-office/texstudio}})
{{FileBox|filename=media-gfx/inkscape*.ebuild|lang=bash|1=
..
RDEPEND="
    latex? (
        virtual/latex-base
        media-gfx/pstoedit[plotutils]
        app-text/dvipsk
    )
"
..
}}
