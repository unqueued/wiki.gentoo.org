===Dependencies===
Since 2010 we have two virtual ebuilds in the tree which consumers of tex/latex should depend on (see also {{Bug|195894}}).
The usually required {{package|virtual/latex-base}} and {{package|virtual/tex-base}}, which is in the tree for completeness but hardly needed.

====If a package requires LaTeX for extra features, ====
If a package requires LaTeX say
* for extra features, 
* to compile the manual, 
* or if it is a TeX gui and should be able to compile user documents, then it should
depend on one of the virtual ebuilds.
If additional TeX packages are required, it has to depend on these too.

(Examples: {{package|media-gfx/inkscape}}, {{package|app-doc/kicad-doc}} or {{package|app-office/texstudio}})
