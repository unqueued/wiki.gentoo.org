===Dependencies===
We have two virtual ebuilds in the tree which consumers of tex/latex should depend on (see also {{Bug|195894}}).

# {{package|virtual/latex-base}} (required in most cases)
# {{package|virtual/tex-base}}

==== Run time dependencies for packages like TeX editors and GUIs ====
If a package requires (La)TeX at runtime, but we do not know what the user wants to do with it exactly, it should depend on
{{package|app-text/texlive}}. 

Examples: {{package|app-office/texstudio}}.
{{FileBox|filename=examples/a-tex-gui*.ebuild|lang=bash|1=
RDEPEND="app-text/texlive"
}}

==== Run time dependencies for packages with specific TeX dependencies ====
If a package requires specific TeX packages at runtime, like in a music score editor, which renders a score with LaTeX, 
it should depend on {{package|virtual/latex-base}} plus the specific packages. 

Examples: {{package|media-sound/lilypond}}.
TODO: FILEBOX

==== Build time dependencies for packages like PDF manuals ====
If a package requires TeX only at build time, it should depend on {{package|virtual/latex-base}} and if required also depend on specific tex packages.

Examples: {{package|app-doc/kicad-doc}} and {{package|media-gfx/inkscape}}.
{{FileBox|filename=media-gfx/inkscape*.ebuild|lang=bash|1=

RDEPEND="
    latex? (
        virtual/latex-base
        media-gfx/pstoedit[plotutils]
        app-text/dvipsk
    )
"
}}
