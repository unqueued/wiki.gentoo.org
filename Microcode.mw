This document [[Article description::describes various ways how to update a CPU's microcode in Gentoo]].

== Introduction ==

Modern processors are complex devices that can have bugs. Furthermore, instead of executing x86 instructions directly, modern x86 processors contain internal code that implements support for the x86 instruction set. The internal code is called microcode. Microcode can be updated to fix or mitigate CPU bugs.

And because [[Complete_Handbook/Making_a_choice|Gentoo is about choices]] there there isn't just one way to update a CPU's microcode. Please choose the workflow which suits your setup.

== Preconditions ==
Ensure you have installed the package which is providing microcode updates for your processor.
Install {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} and/or {{Package|sys-kernel/intel-microcode}}:

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware sys-firmware/intel-microcode}}

Any way to load microcode into the CPU must go through the kernel. Thus the respective options need to be enabled in the kernel configuration. Depending on the make of the CPU installed on the system, choose AMD or Intel microcode loading support (it does not hurt to choose both):

{{KernelBox|title=Configuring a kernel to support microcode loading|1=
Processor type and features --->
   [*] CPU microcode loading support
   [*]   Intel microcode loading support
   [*]   AMD microcode loading support
}}

== Dracut ==

<Please help!>

== Genkernel ==

When using {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel}}, ensure the package containing microcode updates for the processor(s) have been installed (see below). Be sure to call {{c|genkernel}} with the <code>--microcode</code> option:

{{RootCmd|genkernel --microcode}}

To generate a new initramfs with microcode included, call:

{{RootCmd|genkernel --microcode initramfs}}

Be sure to instruct the bootloader to load the newly generated initramfs.

It is recommended {{Path|genkernel.conf}} is updated to contains the following code:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/genkernel.conf|lang=bash|1=
# Add in early microcode support
MICROCODE="yes"
}}

so that you don't need to remember to pass the <code>--microcode</code> parameter all the time.

{{Note|You need {{c|&gt;&#61;}}{{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel}}-3.5.0.7 for microcode support which isn't yet stabilized. Please see for [[Knowledge_Base:Accepting_a_keyword_for_a_single_package|how to keyword a single package]].}}

== The manual way ==

<Please help!>

=== Early microcode loading ===

Basically you provide the microcode as the first initramfs (aka initrd, in cpio format) to the kernel during boot. Grub (both legacy and grub2) lets you specify multiple cpio images separated by space in the initrd command.

<Please help!>

=== Late microcode loading ===

To instruct the kernel to reload microcodes, do

{{RootCmd|echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload}}

and watch ''dmesg'' for any errors.

{{Note|You must run the command above after every reboot or firmware package update.}}

== Specifics ==

<Please help!>

=== AMD specifics ===

AMD microcodes are bundled in the {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} package. A more lengthy guide is found in the [[AMD microcode]] article.

=== Intel specifics ===

Intel microcodes are bundled in the {{Package|sys-firmware/intel-microcode}} package. Detailed instructions can be found in the [[Intel microcode]] article.
