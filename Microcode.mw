This document [[Article description::describes various ways how to update your CPU's microcode in Gentoo]]

== Introduction ==

Modern processors are complex devices that can have bugs. Furthermore, instead of executing x86 instructions directly, modern x86 processors contain internal code that implements support for the x86 instruction set. The internal code is called microcode. Microcode can be updated to fix or mitigate CPU bugs.

And because [[Complete_Handbook/Making_a_choice|Gentoo is about choices]] there there isn't just one way to update your CPU's microcode. Please choose the workflow which suits your setup.

=== Early microcode loading ===
Basically you provide the microcode as the first initramfs (aka initrd, in cpio format) to the kernel during boot. Grub (both legacy and grub2) lets you specify multiple cpio images separated by space in the initrd command.
