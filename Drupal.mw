'''Drupal''' is a powerful [[PHP]] content management system (CMS).

== Preinstall ==
Edit {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} and add "apache2 php gd" to your USE flags.
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Portage configuration file|<pre>
USE="... apache2 php gd ..."
</pre>}}

Edit {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} and add "dev-lang/php mysql mysqli postgres" to PHP USE flags then merge up LAMP.
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use|Portage configuration file|<pre>
dev-lang/php mysql mysqli postgres
</pre>}}

PHP5 notes:

{{Package|dev-lang/php5}} must be built with pcre and session USE flags.

If you rebuild php5 changing flags you will need to restart apache2.

{{Emerge|apache mysql php}}

Scroll up into the emerge log and setup the root user for mysql running the command printed.

Edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/apache2}} and add <code>-D PHP5</code> to your <code>APACHE2_OPTS</code> line.

Start up your LAMP stack
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/mysql start}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/apache2 start}}

Set the LAMP stack to start upon boot
{{RootCmd|rc-update add mysql default}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add apache2 default}}

== Install ==
=== Unmask ===

At the time of writing, {{Package|www-apps/drupal}} is masked as experimental only. If you run a "stable" system, you'll have to add it to your {{Path|/etc/portage/package.keywords}}.
{{File|/etc/portage/package.keywords|Portage configuration file|<pre>
www-apps/drupal
</pre>}}

=== Emerge ===
Now we can get on with emerging:

{{Emerge|drupal}}

You will have to run webapp-config manually.

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -I -h localhost -u root -d /drupal drupal 7.26}}

you may change localhost to the hostname of your virtual host/website.

== Database ==
=== Mysql ===

{{important|change the dbpass to your own password}}

{{RootCmd
|mysql -u root -p
|output=<pre>
mysql> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `drupal` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET `utf8` COLLATE `utf8_unicode_ci`;
mysql> CREATE USER 'drupal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dbpass!!! change me';
mysql> GRANT LOCK TABLES, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER ON `drupal`.* TO 'drupal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dbpass!!! change me';
mysql> \q
</pre>}}

== Web Install ==

if you are using apache 2.4 or newer run this sed command once.

{{RootCmd|sed -i 's\Order allow,deny\Require all granted\' /var/www/localhost/htdocs/drupal/.htaccess}}

point your browser to http://localhost/drupal/install.php

=== Cron ===
Many Drupal modules have periodic tasks that must be triggered by a cron job. To activate these tasks, you must call the cron page. This will pass control to the modules and the modules will decide if and what they must do.

The following example crontab line will activate the cron script on the hour (you can edit the crontab with crontab -e:

<pre>0 * * * * wget -O - -q http://localhost/drupal/cron.php</pre>

== Installing Drupal modules ==

Installing and configuring modules for Drupal is a lot of fun. You can browse the list at http://drupal.org/project/Modules . Untar the packages to drupal/modules but remember, you have to update the database manually for most modules! Installation instructions come with the tar package.

For example, if you want to install the Daily module, and your user for mysql is drupal:

{{RootCmd|mysql -u drupal -ppassword drupal < daily.mysql}}
