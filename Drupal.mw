'''Drupal''' is a powerful [[PHP]] content management system (CMS).

== Preinstall ==

The Drupal package installs everything you need except a database server. 
However, some configuration is best done before installing. And some 
packages might be used for more things than Drupal and hence should be 
installed separately.

=== USE flags ===

If you plan to use the default webserver, Apache 2, edit {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} 
and add "apache2" to your USE flags.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Portage configuration file|1=
USE="... apache2 ..."
}}

Then add the needed USE flags for PHP. Edit {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} and 
add "gd mysql mysqli pdo" to the PHP specific USE flags.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|title=Portage configuration file|1=
dev-lang/php gd mysql mysqli pdo
}}
If you plan to use PostgreSQL instead of the default MySQL / MariaDB, add "postgres.

=== Packages === 

You must install a database server unless you are planning to use an already existing
(remote) server. Use [[MariaDB]] (or [[MySQL]]) 
{{Emerge|dev-db/mariadb}}

If you plan to use a webserver for other things than Drupal, install it separately.
{{Emerge|www-servers/apache}}
if you want to use [[Apache]]. 

If you need [[PHP]] for other web applications, install it separately too.
{{Emerge|dev-lang/php}}

PS! To enable PHP in Apache, edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/apache2}} and add 
<code>-D PHP</code> to your <code>APACHE2_OPTS</code> line. You might 
also want to check out PHP_TARGETS

=== Controlling your LAMP stack ===

Start up your LAMP stack
{{RootCmd|rc-service mysql start}}
{{RootCmd|rc-service apache2 start}}

Set the LAMP stack to start upon boot
{{RootCmd|rc-update add mysql default}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add apache2 default}}

If you use systemd, modify the commands above.

== Install ==
=== Unmask ===

At the time of writing, {{Package|www-apps/drupal}} is masked as experimental only. If you run a "stable" system, you'll have to add it to your {{Path|/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|title=Portage configuration file|1=
www-apps/drupal
}}

=== Emerge ===
Now we can get on with emerging:

{{Emerge|drupal}}

You will have to run webapp-config manually.

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -h localhost -u root -d /drupal -I drupal 8.4.2}}

you may change localhost to the hostname of your virtual host/website.

=== Configure database ===
==== Mysql ====

{{important|change the dbpass to your own password}}

{{RootCmd
|mysql -u root -p
|output=<pre>
mysql> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `drupal` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET `utf8` COLLATE `utf8_unicode_ci`;
mysql> CREATE USER 'drupal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dbpass!!! change me';
mysql> GRANT LOCK TABLES, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER ON `drupal`.* TO 'drupal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dbpass!!! change me';
mysql> \q
</pre>}}

=== Configure Drupal ===

The normal way to configure (or install) Drupal, is to visit your website 
in a browser and follow the instructions. Go to

http://localhost/drupal/

which will redirect you to the Drupal installer. (You can configure Drupal
from the command line using Drush if you prefer.)
