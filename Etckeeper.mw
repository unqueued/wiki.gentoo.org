From the [https://etckeeper.branchable.com/ etckeeper] website:
:etckeeper is a collection of tools to let <code>/etc</code> be stored in a git, mercurial, bazaar or darcs repository. This lets you use git to review or revert changes that were made to <code>/etc</code>. Or even push the repository elsewhere for backups or cherry-picking configuration changes.
:It hooks into package managers like apt to automatically commit changes made to <code>/etc</code> during package upgrades. It tracks file metadata that git does not normally support, but that is important for <code>/etc</code>, such as the permissions of <code>/etc/shadow</code>.
:It's quite modular and configurable, while also being simple to use if you understand the basics of working with version control.
