From the [https://etckeeper.branchable.com/ etckeeper] website:
:etckeeper is a collection of tools to let {{Path|/etc}} be stored in a git, mercurial, bazaar or darcs repository. This lets you use git to review or revert changes that were made to {{Path|/etc}}. Or even push the repository elsewhere for backups or cherry-picking configuration changes.
:It hooks into package managers like apt to automatically commit changes made to {{Path|/etc}} during package upgrades. It tracks file metadata that git does not normally support, but that is important for {{Path|/etc}}, such as the permissions of {{Path|/etc/shadow}}.
:It's quite modular and configurable, while also being simple to use if you understand the basics of working with version control.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/etckeeper}}

=== Emerge ===
Install {{Package|sys-apps/etckeeper}}
{{Emerge|sys-apps/etckeeper}}

=== Additional software ===
etckeeper supports the following VCS: 
* [[git]]
* {{Package|dev-vcs/mercurial}}
* {{Package|dev-vcs/darcs}}
* {{Package|dev-vcs/bzr}}

== Configuration ==

(Explain how to configure the package/software/tool/utility in this section.)


=== Environment variables ===

* <var>VAR1</var>
* <var>VAR2</var>

=== Files ===

The main configuration file is {{Path|/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf}}. 
Following configuration options in the main configuration file need specific settings:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf|1=
# The VCS to use.
VCS="git"

...

# Options passed to git commit when run by etckeeper.
GIT_COMMIT_OPTIONS=""

...

# Etckeeper includes both a cron job and a systemd timer, which each
# can commit exiting changes to /etc automatically once per day.
# To enable the systemd timer, run: systemctl enable etckeeper.timer
# The cron job is enabled by default; to disable it, uncomment this next line.
AVOID_DAILY_AUTOCOMMITS=1

...

# Uncomment to avoid etckeeper committing existing changes to
# /etc before installation. It will cancel the installation,
# so you can commit the changes by hand.
AVOID_COMMIT_BEFORE_INSTALL=1

...

# Gentoo specific:                                                                                                                                                                                          
# For portage this is emerge
# For paludis this is cave
HIGHLEVEL_PACKAGE_MANAGER=emerge

# Gentoo specific:
# For portage this is qlist
# For paludis this is cave
LOWLEVEL_PACKAGE_MANAGER=qlist

...

# To push each commit to a remote, put the name of the remote here.
# (eg, "origin" for git). Space-separated lists of multiple remotes
# also work (eg, "origin gitlab github" for git).
PUSH_REMOTE=""
}}

=== Service ===

==== Cron ====
The cron job is enabled by default, to disable it, uncomment following configuration entry:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf|1=
...
#AVOID_DAILY_AUTOCOMMITS=1
..
}}

==== systemd ====
To enable the systemd timer, run: 
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable etckeeper.timer}}

== Usage ==

{{Note|Before configuring etckeeper further, inspect first the [https://etckeeper.branchable.com/README/ README] file and read the "Security warnings" section.}}

{{RootCmd|cd /etc}}

To add interesting files of the {{Path|/etc}} directory to the repository, run following command:
Command used below creates a {{Path|.gitignore}} file in the {{Path|/etc}} directory. If a {{Path|.gitignore}} file already exist then the content inside a "managed by etckeeper" comment block will get updated. It sets up pre-commit hooks. This command does not commit files, but does {{C|git add}} all interesting files for an initial commit later.

{{RootCmd|etckeeper init}}

Using the {{C|sudo}} command credentials of the user will be stored in the repository:
{{Cmd|sudo etckeeper init}}

Before initial commit inspect the files added to the repository f.e. the shadow file
{{RootCmd|cd /etc}}
{{RootCmd|git status | grep shadow
|output=<pre>
        new file:   gshadow
        new file:   gshadow-
        new file:   pam.d/shadow
        new file:   shadow
        new file:   shadow-
</pre>
}}

Remove not interesting files from the repository
{{RootCmd|git rm -r --cached shadow*}}

Add not interesting files to the {{Path|.gitignore}} file
{{RootCmd|echo shadow* >> /etc/.gitignore}}

Finally commit all changes in {{Path|/etc}} to the repository. A commit message can be specified. It is possible to use the underlying VCS to commit manually. Note that etckeeper commit will notice if a user has used {{C|sudo}} or {{C|su}} to become root, and record the original username in the commit.

{{Cmd|sudo etckeeper commit initial-commit-message}}

Pack git repository to save disk space:
{{Cmd|git gc}}

== Troubleshooting ==

(Troubleshoot issues in this section. Separate issues by best describing the error with a new section name. Remove if no issues are known.)

== Removal ==

Following commands deletes the {{Path|/etc/.git}} directory:

{{RootCmd|etckeeper uninit
|output=<pre>

** Warning: This will DESTROY all recorded history for /etc,
** including the git repository.

Are you sure you want to do this? [yN]
</pre>
}}

Uninstall etckeeper:
{{Unmerge|sys-apps/etckeeper}}
