From the [https://etckeeper.branchable.com/ etckeeper] website:
:etckeeper is a collection of tools to let {{Path|/etc}} be stored in a git, mercurial, bazaar or darcs repository. This lets you use git to review or revert changes that were made to {{Path|/etc}}. Or even push the repository elsewhere for backups or cherry-picking configuration changes.
:It hooks into package managers like apt to automatically commit changes made to {{Path|/etc}} during package upgrades. It tracks file metadata that git does not normally support, but that is important for {{Path|/etc}}, such as the permissions of {{Path|/etc/shadow}}.
:It's quite modular and configurable, while also being simple to use if you understand the basics of working with version control.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/etckeeper}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|sys-apps/etckeeper}}

{{Emerge|sys-apps/etckeeper}}

=== Additional software ===

etckeeper supports the following version control systems:
* [[git]]
* {{Package|dev-vcs/mercurial}}
* {{Package|dev-vcs/darcs}}
* {{Package|dev-vcs/bzr}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

The main configuration file is {{Path|/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf}}. Following configuration options in the main configuration file need specific settings:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf|1=
# The VCS to use.
VCS="git"

...

# Options passed to git commit when run by etckeeper.
GIT_COMMIT_OPTIONS=""

...

# Etckeeper includes both a cron job and a systemd timer, which each
# can commit exiting changes to /etc automatically once per day.
# To enable the systemd timer, run: systemctl enable etckeeper.timer
# The cron job is enabled by default; to disable it, uncomment this next line.
AVOID_DAILY_AUTOCOMMITS=1

...

# Uncomment to avoid etckeeper committing existing changes to
# /etc before installation. It will cancel the installation,
# so you can commit the changes by hand.
AVOID_COMMIT_BEFORE_INSTALL=1

...

# Gentoo specific:                                                                                                                                                                                          
# For portage this is emerge
# For paludis this is cave
HIGHLEVEL_PACKAGE_MANAGER=emerge

# Gentoo specific:
# For portage this is qlist
# For paludis this is cave
LOWLEVEL_PACKAGE_MANAGER=qlist

...

# To push each commit to a remote, put the name of the remote here.
# (eg, "origin" for git). Space-separated lists of multiple remotes
# also work (eg, "origin gitlab github" for git).
PUSH_REMOTE=""
}}

=== Service ===

==== Cron ====

The cron job is enabled by default, to disable it, uncomment following configuration entry:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf|1=
...
#AVOID_DAILY_AUTOCOMMITS=1
..
}}

==== systemd ====

To enable the systemd timer, run: 

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable etckeeper.timer}}

== Usage ==

{{Note|Before configuring etckeeper further, inspect first the [https://etckeeper.branchable.com/README/ README] file and read the "Security warnings" section.}}

First, it must be considered if sensitive files (such as private keys) shall be included in the repository. If there are concerns, it is suggested to create a {{Path|.gitignore}} file before running the etckeeper initialization.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/.gitignore|1=
shadow*
gshadow*
ssh/ssh_host_*
ssl/private/*
}}

Initialization of the repository is done by running:

{{RootCmd|cd /etc|etckeeper init}}

When initialization is done throught {{C|sudo}} command, the author of the commit will be set to the corresponding user:

{{Cmd|sudo etckeeper init}}

The command creates a {{Path|.gitignore}} file in the {{Path|/etc}} directory. If it already exist, then a "managed by etckeeper" comment block is added. It also sets up pre-commit hooks. This command does not yet commit files, but runs {{C|git add}} to ensure all interesting files are included in the initial commit later.

{{Note|In {{Path|.gitignore}}, do not manually edit inside the "managed by etckeeper" comment blocks. Place your own additions outside these blocks.}}

When specific files shall be excluded,  effectiveness of the {{Path|.gitignore}} file can be verified by running {{C|git status}}. In the following example it is tested whether shadow files will be checked in. If any files that shall be excluded show up as a ''new file'', then the {{Path|.gitignore}} is not applied properly and needs fixing.

{{RootCmd|cd /etc |git status {{!}} grep shadow
|output=<pre>
        new file:   gshadow
        new file:   gshadow-
        new file:   pam.d/shadow
        new file:   shadow
        new file:   shadow-
</pre>
}}

If not interesting files show up, it is suggested to undo the etckeeper initialization (as described later in the Removal section), fix the {{Path|.gitignore}} and start again.

Finally commit all changes in {{Path|/etc}} to the repository. A commit message can be specified. It is possible to use the underlying VCS to commit manually. Note that {{C|etckeeper}} commit will notice if a user has used {{C|sudo}} or {{C|su}} to become root, and record the original username in the commit. At this time it is recommended to use the {{C|git commit}} command.

{{RootCmd|cd /etc|git commit -a -m  'initial /etc commit'}}

If the initial version has been commited, from this time forward it is safe to use following command below to commit diffs:

{{Cmd|sudo etckeeper commit new-changes}}

or:

{{RootCmd|etckeeper commit new-changes}}

Pack git repository to save disk space:

{{Cmd|git gc}}

== Troubleshooting ==

(Troubleshoot issues in this section. Separate issues by best describing the error with a new section name. Remove if no issues are known.)

== Removal ==

Following commands deletes the {{Path|/etc/.git}} directory:

{{RootCmd|etckeeper uninit
|output=<pre>

** Warning: This will DESTROY all recorded history for /etc,
** including the git repository.

Are you sure you want to do this? [yN]
</pre>
}}

Uninstall etckeeper:

{{Unmerge|sys-apps/etckeeper}}
