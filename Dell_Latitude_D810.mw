== Dell Latitude D810 ==

This article will describe configuration and kernel options to make make the hardware work in Gentoo.

'''Work in progress.'''

=== Hardware ===

''The below list is based on the machine this configuration was done one. There might be some variance.''

* CPU: Intel Pentium M 2.0 GHz
* Video: Radeon X600 Graphics
* Display: 15.4" 1920x1200 display
* Audio: 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Audio Controller
* USB: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) USB UHCI
* USB: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller
* Wired network: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5751 Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express

=== Choosing the right install medium ===
The D810 has a modular bay that could contain a DVD/CD drive, floppy drive or less useful to the install, a battery. Using a CD or DVD is fine, but the machine also supports booting from USB.

If your boot order is not already accommodating, tap {{Key|F2}} ({{Key|F12}}?) at the POST screen to get a menu of available choices and boot the install media.

=== CPU ===
The CPU is an Intel Pentium M.
