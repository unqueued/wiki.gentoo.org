This article describes the setup of '''smartmontools''', a utility to read and monitor S.M.A.R.T. information of disk drives.

== Installation ==
=== BIOS ===
Often you can enable or disable this feature in your [[BIOS]]. Enable it.

=== Software ===
Install {{Package|sys-apps/smartmontools}}:
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/smartmontools
|caps
|minimal
|static++no
}}
{{Emerge|smartmontools}}

== Configuration ==
== Usage ==
'''smartctl''' is the main tool of smartmontools:
* '''smartctl -i /dev/sda''' - Check if S.M.A.R.T. is supported.
* '''smartctl -s on /dev/sda''' - Enable S.M.A.R.T.
* '''smartctl -H /dev/sda''' - Read S.M.A.R.T. information. If the result is ''<code>PASSED</code>'', everything is fine. If the result is ''<code>FAILED</code>'', you should backup your data. The disk drive screwed up or will in the next 24 hours.
* '''smartctl -l error /dev/sda''' - Read S.M.A.R.T. error messages. Shows all reported errors. If the result is ''<code>No Errors Logged</code>'', everything is fine. If there are some old errors, it's also OK. If there are lots of recent errors, backup your data.
* '''smartctl -c /dev/sda''' - Start a S.M.A.R.T. test-run. Shows which tests are supported. The tests runs in the background, so you can work normally. The list shows how long the tests will take.
* '''smartctl -t offline /dev/sda''' - Start the a specific test, e.g. '''S.M.A.R.T. Immediate Offline Test'''. Outputs how long the test will take. The result is later available as error message.

== S.M.A.R.T. daemon ==
The daemon '''smartd''' checks your disk drives continuously. {{Path|/etc/smartd.conf}} is its config file. See the [[man page]] for more information: '''man smartd.conf'''. Errors will be reported to {{Path|/var/log/messages}}.

You can now start smartd:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/smartd start}}
To start smartd at boot time, add it your runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add smartd}}
