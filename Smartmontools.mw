This article describes the setup of '''smartmontools''', a utility to read and monitor S.M.A.R.T. information of disk drives.

== Installation ==

=== BIOS ===
Often you can enable or disable this feature in your [[BIOS]]. Enable it.

=== Software ===
Install {{Package|sys-apps/smartmontools}}:
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/smartmontools
|caps
|minimal
|static++no
}}
{{Emerge|smartmontools}}

== Usage ==
'''smartctl''' is the main tool of smartmontools:
* '''smartctl -i /dev/sda''' - Check if S.M.A.R.T. is supported.
* '''smartctl -s on /dev/sda''' - Enable S.M.A.R.T.
* '''smartctl -H /dev/sda''' - Read S.M.A.R.T. information. If the result is ''<code>PASSED</code>'', everything is fine. If the result is ''<code>FAILED</code>'', you should backup your data. The disk drive screwed up or will in the next 24 hours.
* '''smartctl -c /dev/sda''' - Shows which tests are supported and how long the tests will take.
* '''smartctl -t <test> /dev/sda''' - Start the a specific test. Possible values for '''<test>''' are:
** '''offline''' - Run the S.M.A.R.T. Immediate Offline Test. The result is later available in the '''error''' log.
** '''short''' - Run the S.M.A.R.T. Short Self Test. The result is later available in the '''selftest''' log.
** '''long''' - Run the S.M.A.R.T. Extended Self Test. The result is later available in the '''selftest''' log.
** '''conveyance''' - Run the S.M.A.R.T. Conveyance Self Test. The result is later available in the '''selftest''' log.
* '''smartctl -l <log> /dev/sda''' - Print either the S.M.A.R.T. Error Log or the S.M.A.R.T. Self-Test Log. Possible values for '''<log>''' are:
** '''error''' - Print the S.M.A.R.T. Error Log. Shows all reported errors. If the result is ''<code>No Errors Logged</code>'', everything is fine. If there are some old errors, it's also OK. If there are lots of recent errors, backup your data.
** '''selftest''' - Print the S.M.A.R.T. Self-Test Log. Results for short, long and conveyance tests are reported here.

== S.M.A.R.T. daemon ==
The daemon '''smartd''' checks your disk drives continuously. {{Path|/etc/smartd.conf}} is its config file. See the ''smartd.conf'' [[man page]] for more information. Errors will be reported to {{Path|/var/log/messages}}.

You can now start smartd:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/smartd start}}
To start smartd at boot time, add it your runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add smartd default}}
