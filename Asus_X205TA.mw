The following is a semi-structured, rough laptop blueprint users can copy and paste to create new articles for getting Gentoo working on a specific laptop. In general, it follows the [[Gentoo_Wiki:Guidelines|Wiki guidelines]] (review if necessary). Be sure to substitute the information in the article accordingly, as there can be vast differences between architectures and hardware sets for each laptop. Be aware some information provided in the blueprint may not be needed; wiki contributors know it is easier to delete unneeded content than to type out new content. These sections are typically identified with "Optional section" in the leading sentence.

* Before copying it is possible to demo the Laptop article blueprint by [[/Example|going here.]]

{{Important|Not every laptop article will fit into the outline of this blueprint; it is simply <u>a rough framework</u> to assist in article creation. Modify as needed!}}

Substitute <code><Laptop_MAKE_MODEL_NAME></code> in the text below with the correct make and model of the laptop being covered.

Suggestion for the article's Summary field: <code>Initial creation of the <Laptop_Make_Model_title> article. Show it some love by improving it!</code>
