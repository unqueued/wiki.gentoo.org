== Installing Postfix ==
Postfix installation is quite straight forward. A basic installation instruction can be found here on the wiki for [[Postfix]].

== Linking Postfix ==
Once basic postfix is working on its most basic level its time to link it to the database.
=== Gaining access ===
==== PostgreSQL ====
When using postfix on the same host, the local unix socket connection is recommended. For this postfix needs rights on the socket.
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a postfix postgres}}

Also a database-user to query the database is required.
{{RootCmd|createuser -U postgres -D -P -R -S postfix|output=<pre>
Enter password for new role: $password
Enter it again: $password
</pre>}}
Also the postfix user needs some permissions on the tables.
{{RootCmd|psql -U postfixadmin postfix|output=<pre>
postfix=>
GRANT SELECT ON alias TO postfix;
GRANT SELECT ON domain TO postfix;
GRANT SELECT ON mailbox TO postfix;
</pre>}}

=== Queering ===
==== PostgreSQL ====
Linking postfix to a database isn't that special, postfix just executes predefined SQL routines. These SQL queries will be stored in a file per query in a directory.
{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/postfix/pgsql}}
Be aware that any errors in the configuration information in these files can be pretty tricky to track down. Be meticulous with both the contents of the files and their names. Many errors in these files will be announced in the mail log such as "user example@example.com doesn't exist" without much further explanations.

{{Note|In the following files, the variable 'hosts' is commented on purpose. When no hosts are defined, the local unix socket is used.}}
{{File|/etc/postfix/pgsql/virtual_mailbox_domains.cf|virtal_mailbox_domains|<pre>
# virtual_mailbox_domains.cf
user            = postfix
password        = $password
dbname          = postfix
#hosts          = localhost
query           = SELECT description FROM domain WHERE domain = '%s' AND backupmx = '0' AND active = '1';
</pre>}}
It's best to test the query on the database (using copy paste) to ensure no typo's exist in the query.
{{RootCmd|psql -U postfix postfix|output=<pre>
postfix=> SELECT description FROM domain WHERE domain = 'example.com' AND backupmx = '0' AND active = '1';
     description      
----------------------
 An example domain.
(1 row)

</pre>}}
{{Note|Postfix does not care about the result in this query, it is more of a yes/no answer.}}
