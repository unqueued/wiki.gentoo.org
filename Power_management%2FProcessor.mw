This article describes the setup of [[power management]] for [[:Category:Processors|prozessors]].

== CPU frequency scaling ==
{{InfoBox stack
|{{InfoBox wikipedia|Dynamic frequency scaling|header=true}}
}}
CPU frequency scaling is a technique whereby the frequency of a processor can be automatically adjusted "on the fly"  to conserve power and to reduce the amount of heat generated by the chip.

=== Installation ===

==== BIOS ====
Some functions can be enabled or disabled in the [[BIOS]]. Check that them are enabled, e.g.:
* ''Processor C1E support''
* ''Enhanced Speedstep (EIST)''

==== Kernel ====
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||
Power management and ACPI options  --->
     [*] ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support  --->
         <*>   Processor
     CPU Frequency scaling  --->
         [*] CPU Frequency scaling
             Default CPUFreq governor (ondemand)  --->
                 Select a default governor; see below table
                 Default is:
                 ondemand
             x86 CPU frequency scaling drivers  --->
                 Select a driver, see below table
}}

You need a governor, who changes the frequency based on his profile:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Default CPUFreq governor
|-
! Option
! Module
! Supported Processors
! Note
|-
| 'performance' governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_performance}}
| Sets the frequency statically to the highest available CPU frequency.
|
|-
| 'powersave' governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_powersave}}
| Sets the frequency statically to the lowest available CPU frequency.
| Can't be set as default governor
|-
| 'userspace' governor for userspace frequency scaling
| {{ta|cpufreq_userspace}}
| To set the CPU frequency manually or when a userspace program shall be able to set the CPU dynamically.
|
|-
| 'ondemand' cpufreq policy governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_ondemand}} 
| Does a periodic polling and changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.
| recommend
|-
| 'conservative' cpufreq governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_conservative}}
| Similar to ondemand. The frequency is gracefully increased and decreased rather than jumping to 100% when speed is required.
|
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|+ x86 CPU frequency scaling drivers
|-
! Option
! Module
! Supported Processors
! Note
|-
| Processor Clocking Control interface driver
| {{ta|pcc-cpufreq}}
|
|
|-
| ACPI Processor P-States driver
| {{ta|acpi-cpufreq}}
| Intel Core, [[Intel Core 2]], Intel Atom, Intel Pentium M
|
|-
| AMD Opteron/Athlon64 PowerNow!
| {{ta|powernow-k8}}
| AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon 64, AMD Turion 64
|
|-
| Intel Enhanced SpeedStep (deprecated)
| {{ta|speedstep_centrino}}
| Intel Pentium M (Centrino), Intel Xeon
| Deprecate, use '''ACPI Processor P-States driver''' instead.
|-
| Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation
| {{ta|p4-clockmod}}
| Intel Pentium 4, Intel XEON
| Causes severe slowdowns and noticeable latencies
|}

== Ticks ==
The processor saves the most energy, when he stays for longer in power savings modes, so you have to reduce the amount of ticks, that wakes him up.

=== Installation ===

==== BIOS ====
Some functions can be enabled or disabled in the [[BIOS]]. Check that them are enabled, e.g.:
* ''HPET''
* ''Multimedia timer''

==== Kernel ====
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
   [*] Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks)
   [*] High Resolution Timer Support
   [*] HPET Timer Support
</pre>}}

== PowerTOP ==
{{InfoBox stack
|{{InfoBox wikipedia|PowerTOP|header=true}}
}}
PowerTOP is a utility designed to measure, explain and minimise a computer's electrical power consumption.

=== Installation ===

==== Kernel ====
{{Kernel||<pre>
Power management and ACPI options  --->
   [*] Power Management Debug Support
   [*]   Extra PM attributes in sysfs for low-level debugging/testing
Kernel hacking  --->
   [*] Kernel debugging
   [*] Collect kernel timers statistics
</pre>}}

==== Software ====
Install {{Package|sys-power/powertop}}:
{{USEflag
|unicode+yes
}}
{{Emerge|sys-power/powertop}}

=== Usage ===
'''powertop''' - Sorts the running processes in order how often they cause the processor to wake up.
