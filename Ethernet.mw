This article describes the setup of an Ethernet network device.

== Installation ==

=== Hardware detection ===

To choose the right driver, first detect the used Ethernet controllers. Use {{c|[[Hardware detection|lspci]]}} for this task:

{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep --color Ethernet}}

=== Kernel ===

The next step is to activate the kernel options appropriate to the Ethernet hardware in the machine. Open up a second terminal window in order to reference the output generated in the step above. The option to enable Ethernet drivers can be found in the following location: 

{{KernelBox|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Networking support  --->
        [*] Network device support --->
            [*]   Ethernet driver support  --->
</pre>}}

Scan the drivers carefully. Compare the results of the {{c|lspci}} command above with the available drivers in the list. Enable the feature(s) that match the installed Ethernet device(s).

{{Note|For more information on configuring the kernel see the [[Kernel/Configuration| kernel configuration]] article.}} 

== Configuration ==

=== Physical interface settings ===

List '''eth0''' physical interface settings using {{package|sys-apps/ethtool}}:

{{RootCmd|ethtool eth0|output=<pre>
Settings for eth0:
        Supported ports: [ TP ]
        Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
                                100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full
                                1000baseT/Full
        Supported pause frame use: No
        Supports auto-negotiation: Yes
        Advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
                                100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full
                                1000baseT/Full
        Advertised pause frame use: No
        Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes
        Speed: 1000Mb/s
        Duplex: Full
        Port: Twisted Pair
        PHYAD: 0
        Transceiver: internal
        Auto-negotiation: on
        MDI-X: off (auto)
        Supports Wake-on: umbg
        Wake-on: g
        Current message level: 0x00000007 (7)
                               drv probe link
        Link detected: yes
</pre>}}

* Or using {{c|mii-tool}} from {{package|sys-apps/net-tools}} package:

{{RootCmd|mii-tool eth0 -v|output=<pre>
eth0: negotiated 1000baseT-FD flow-control, link ok
  product info: vendor 23:58:00, model 42 rev 0
  basic mode:   autonegotiation enabled
  basic status: autonegotiation complete, link ok
  capabilities: 1000baseT-FD 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
  advertising:  1000baseT-FD 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD flow-control
  link partner: 1000baseT-HD 1000baseT-FD 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD
</pre>}}

{{Note|The output of {{c|mii-tool}} sometimes does not work for certain network drivers.}}

=== Physical interface features (TCP offloading) ===

Sometimes NIC's have basic/partial TCP/IP stack implementation, and support offloading of certain networking routines/protocols to the NIC chip.

Example below shows network interface offloading features supported on device '''eth0''':

{{RootCmd|ethtool --show-offload eth0|output=<pre>
Features for eth0:
rx-checksumming: off
tx-checksumming: on
        tx-checksum-ipv4: off [fixed]
        tx-checksum-ip-generic: on
        tx-checksum-ipv6: off [fixed]
        tx-checksum-fcoe-crc: off [fixed]
        tx-checksum-sctp: off [fixed]
scatter-gather: on
        tx-scatter-gather: on
        tx-scatter-gather-fraglist: off [fixed]
tcp-segmentation-offload: on
        tx-tcp-segmentation: on
        tx-tcp-ecn-segmentation: off [fixed]
        tx-tcp6-segmentation: off [fixed]
udp-fragmentation-offload: off [fixed]

rx-fcs: off
rx-all: off
</pre>}}
