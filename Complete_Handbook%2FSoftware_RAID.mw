== Software RAID ==

=== Introduction ===
Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) is a technology to combine multiple disks to improve the reliability and/or performance. There is hardware RAID, implemented by the controller on your motherboard or specific extention cards, and there is software RAID, implemented by the kernel. 

{{Note|Be aware that a reliable RAID does not take away the need for a backup!}}

=== Advantages ===
The main advantages of RAID are reliability and/or performance improvements.

There are quite some difference between soft- and hardware RAID. These are things like cost, performance, overhead and flexibility. Of course software RAID comes cheapest. Another advantage of soft- over hardware RAID is that you can easily move you RAID set to another (Linux) computer. With hardware RAID you will depend on the Vendor.

=== Disadvantages ===
RAID usually takes more disk space then it delivers. E.g. a RAID-1 set of 2 3TB disks delivers you a 3TB RAID disk, that is a reduction of 50%.

* The time it takes to synchronize you RAID disk (initially and when they need to rebuild).
* The extra effort to manage and monitor your RAID disks. Nothing is more frustrating then loosing the 2nd disk from your 3 disk RAID-5 set after you did not notice the first disk was out-of-order for months already :-(

== Setting up software RAID ==

=== Installing the tools ===
Start with your kernel configuration. After all, the kernel does most of the work:
{{Kernel||<pre>
[*] Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM)
        <*> RAID support
            [*] Autodetect RAID arrays during kernel boot

            If you want to combine multiple disks or partitions to one (bigger) device:
                <*> Linear (append) mode

            If you want to increase IO performance by striping data across multiple disks (at the expense of reliability):
                <*> RAID-0 (striping) mode

            If you want to increase reliability by mirroring data across multiple disks (at the expense of less storage capacity):
                <*> RAID-1 (mirroring) mode

            If you want to combine the previous two options (for whatever reason):
                <*> RAID-10 (mirrored striping) mode

            If you want to combine 3 or more disks for reliability and performance:
                <*> RAID-4/RAID-5/RAID-6 mode
</pre>}}

Get the proper RAID admin tool:
{{RootCmd|emerge mdadm}} 

Make sure your RAID disks are started and stopped: 
{{RootCmd|rc-update add mdraid boot}} 

=== Using software RAID ===
To create a simple mirrored disk, make sure you have two partitions that have the same size and bring them together in your first RAID-1 disk:
{{RootCmd|mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level{{=}}1 --raid-devices{{=}}2 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1}}

The disks in the mirror will now be synchronized (also when there is no data or file system yet). you can check the status like this:
{{Cmd|cat /proc/mdstat|output=<pre>Personalities : [raid1] 
md1 : active raid1 sde2[1] sdd2[0]
      1900953472 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU]
      [======>..............]  resync = 31.6% (600768512/1900953472) finish=819.4min speed=26444K/sec
      
md0 : active raid1 sde1[1] sdd1[0]
      52395904 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU]
      
unused devices: <none>
</pre>}}

Create you filesystem-of-choice:
{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0}}

and off you go.

=== Software RAID for root file system ===
==== Boot using GRUB 2.x ====
When using [[GRUB2|GRUB 2.x]] and the root file system is located on a software RAID, add the ''domdadm'' parameter to the Kernel parameters in /etc/default/grub:
{{File|/etc/default/grub||<pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="domdadm"</pre>}}

== Managing software RAID ==

=== Adding disk === 

To add new disk to RAID, you need issue this command:

{{RootCmd|mdadm /dev/md0 --add /dev/sdd1}}

If RAID have all healthy members, new disk will be added as spare disk (S).

===Removing disks ===

First you need determine what disk you need to remove.

{{RootCmd|cat /proc/mdstat|output=<pre>
md0 : active raid1 sdd1[1](F) sde1[0]
      32000 blocks [2/1] [U_]
      bitmap: 0/4 pages [0KB], 4KB chunk</pre>
}}

As you can see, there sdd1 marked as failed (F) and RAID missing one of disks ([U_]). To remove that drive you need execute following command:

{{RootCmd|mdadm /dev/md0 --remove /dev/sdd1}}

Now you need to replace sdd disk or add blank space from somewhere.

Sometime you may need remove healthy member. For this you need to mark drive as failed and remove it. That can be done with this one command:

{{RootCmd|mdadm /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sdd1 --remove /dev/sdd1}}

=== Changing RAID layout ===

In some cases you can change RAID layout, for example, add disks to RAID1 or convert RAID1 to RAID5.
