OpenRC ships since version 0.25 with its own [[init system]]. It is called ''openrc-init'', and can replace Gentoo's current default [[sysvinit]]'s ''init''.

== Kernel commandline ==
Replacing sysvinit with openrc-init requires passing <code>init=/sbin/openrc-init</code> on the linux kernel commandline at boot time. This description refers to [[GRUB2]]; adapt as needed in case a different boot manager is used. 

Update {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} as follows:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default/grub|lang=ini|1=
#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="init=/sbin/openrc-init" }} 

Regenerate {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}}: 
{{RootCmd
|mount /boot                # if not mounted already
|grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg }}

== Start terminals as OpenRC services ==
Openrc-init does not use {{Path|/etc/inittab}}, so the agetty processes for tty1 to tty6 will need to be started explicitly as services. 

Create the links in {{Path|/etc/init.d}} and add them to the default run level:
{{RootCmd
|cd /etc/init.d 
|for n in `seq 1 6`; do ln -s agetty agetty.tty$n; rc-config add agetty.tty$n default; done 
}}

== Reboot ==
Reboot your system after completing the above steps: 
{{RootCmd
| reboot }}

== Openrc-shutdown ==
Be aware that commands like {{c|reboot}}, and {{c|shutdown}} are no longer working under openrc-init. Instead there is {{c|openrc-shutdown}}. Check its [//manpages.debian.org/testing/openrc/openrc-shutdown.8.en.html man page] for its usage. 

Defining aliases might help to keep using the same commands:
{{FileBox|filename=/root/.profile|lang=ini|1=
alias reboot="openrc-shutdown -r now"
alias halt="openrc-shutdown -H now"
alias shutdown="openrc-shutdown"
}}
