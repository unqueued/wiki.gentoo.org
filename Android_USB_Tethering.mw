'''''Tethering''' means sharing the Internet connection of an Internet-capable mobile phone with other devices. This sharing can be offered over a wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), or over Bluetooth, or by physical connection using a cable'' ([[Wikipedia:Tethering|Tethering]]).

The focus in this article is '''USB tethering'''.

Android mobile phones can behave as an external network interface <tt>usbN</tt>, connected via the USB infrastructure. The <tt>usbN</tt> interface is in turn connected to the mobile phone LAN, providing dhcp server, DNS server, gateway and so on.

That is how a mobile phone can provide an Internet connection to another device.

Android phones are already equipped to provide this functionality. Simply connect the USB cable and go to {{Path|Settings -> Wireless settings -> Tethering -> Tethering USB}}.

What you need is some kernel and network configuration on the other side (e.g. a laptop).

Features can either be built-in to the kernel or available as loadable modules.

{{Note|The ''RNDIS'' feature seems to only be needed in some cases. See [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-843255.html this thread] to learn more.}}

{{RootCmd|ifconfig -a}}

If you see <tt>usb0</tt> (0 may be a different number) you are all set.

== Connecting ==

Since the mobile phone LAN changes its addresses, you need a DHCP client to configure the <tt>usbN</tt> device.

If you are on a laptop, you probably have a DHCP client. If not, emerge {{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd}}:

{{Emerge|net-misc/dhcpcd}}

=== Manually ===

Simply run {{c|dhcpcd}} after plug/mobile activation:

{{RootCmd|dhcpcd usb0}}

=== Permanent configuration ===

Edit your {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}} to have a permanent, automatic activation of the interface.

{{RootCmd|echo "config_usb0{{=}}\"dhcp\"" >> /etc/conf.d/net}}

Once plugged in and activated on the mobile phone side, the usb0 will be up and configured.

=== Checks ===

Run the usual checks to verify the connection:

{{RootCmd
|ifconfig usb0
|route
|cat /etc/resolv.conf
}}

== Advanced network settings ==

DHCP is very quick, but the default settings don't give you as much freedom as you may want.

A possible scenario is that you are in a corporate, protected LAN context that doesn't provide Internet connection but you need to stay connected to have access to some Intranet resource.

Or maybe you have a free but limited connection (a public WiFi network allowing HTTP only, an evil firewall, etc.). Since mobile connections could be expensive, you could want to save money by tethering only when needed.

Here is a handful of examples pertaining to DHCP usage.

If you want to limit the information set by DHCP, you can fine-tune its behaviour.

E.g.:

{{RootCmd|dhcpcd --nogateway --nohook resolv.conf --nohook hostname usb0}}

This will let your default gateway, {{Path|resolv.conf}} and hostname as they are, letting you provide extra info by hand.

E.g.:

{{RootCmd|route add -host my_sshd_remote_host_IP dev usb0}}

Finally, you can permanently configure your USB network interface.

E.g:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/net|lang=bash|1=
config_usb0="dhcp"
dhcpcd_usb0="--nogateway --nohook resolv.conf --nohook hostname"
# Special hosts
postup()
{
    if [[ "usb0" == ${IFACE} ]]; then
        route add -host my_sshd_remote_host_IP dev usb0
    fi
}
}}

Generally, you can avoid every DHCP setting (see the [[man page]]) but gather them with:

{{RootCmd|dhcpcd -U usb0}}

Then you can set what you want in the <code>postup</code> hook.
