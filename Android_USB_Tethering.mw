== Introduction ==
'''''Tethering''' means sharing the Internet connection of an Internet-capable mobile phone with other devices. This sharing can be offered over a wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), or over Bluetooth, or by physical connection using a cable'' ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering Wikipedia]).

Our focus in this article will be the '''USB tethering'''.<br />
Your Android mobile phone can behave as an external network interface <tt>usbN</tt>, connected via the USB infrastructure. The <tt>usbN</tt> interface is in turn connected to the mobile phone LAN, providing dhcp server, DNS server, gateway and so on.<br />
That's how your mobile phone can provide an Internet connection to another device.

Android phones are already equipped to provide this functionality. Simply connect the USB cable and go to Settings -> Wireless settings -> Tethering -> Tethering USB).

What you need is some kernel and network configuration on the other side (e.g. your laptop).

== Tested Device ==

'''Google Nexus One'''<br />
'''LG P350''' (Android 2.2.1 build FRG83)

== Kernel configuration ==

{{Kernel|.config 3.0.6-gentoo|<pre>
General setup  --->
    [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
Device Drivers --->
    [*] Network device support --->
        USB Network Adapters --->
            [*] Multi-purpose USB Networking Framework
                <M> CDC Ethernet support
                <M> CDC EEM support
                <M> Simple USB Network Links (CDC Ethernet subset)
                <M>   Host for RNDIS and ActiveSync devices
            [*] Embedded ARM Linux links
</pre>}}
You can either build the options in the kernel or leave them as module.<br />
The ''RNDIS'' option seems to be needed in some situation only. See [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-843255-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-0.html this thread] to learn more.

{{RootCmd|ifconfig -a}}
If you see <tt>usb0</tt> (or whatever number you'll get) you are all set.

== Connecting ==
Since the mobile phone LAN changes its addresses, you need a DHCP client to configure the <tt>usbN</tt> device.

If you are on a laptop, you probably have a DHCP client. If not, emerge {{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd}}.
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --verbose net-misc/dhcpcd}}

Then, simply run it.
{{RootCmd|dhcpcd usb0}}

Run the usual checks to verify your connection.
{{RootCmd|ifconfig usb0}}
{{RootCmd|route}}
{{RootCmd|cat /etc/resolv.conf}}
