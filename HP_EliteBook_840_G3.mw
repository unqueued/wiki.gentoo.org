== Installation ==

(Write the necessary steps to get Gentoo onto this system. Try to document any special step that each user will need to reproduce on their system. Includes getting special drivers or firmware from a manufacturer website, etc.)

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|1=
INPUT_DEVICES="libinput synaptics"
VIDEO_CARDS="i965 intel"
ALSA_CARDS="hda-intel"
}}

=== Firmware ===

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}

=== Kernel ===

(Show what options are necessary in the kernel in order to get all device components functional for this hardware platform.)

{{KernelBox|title=Ethernet controller|1=
Generic Driver Options  --->
   [*] Network device support  ---
      [*]   Ethernet driver support  --->
         [*]   Intel devices
         <*>     Intel(R) PRO/1000 PCI-Express Gigabit Ethernet support
}}


Building the following device driver as module may be appropriate as it requires firmware during initialization.

=== Emerge ===

(Optional section. If the platform requires any user space packages or kernel patches, mention them here).

{{Emerge|category/package}}

== Configuration ==

(Explain any additional configuration or special customization for this hardware platform. Could be anything from BIOS settings to assigning proper media key functionality.)

=== Example 1 ===

(Example: Do this in order to get these keys working.)

== Troubleshooting ==

(Optional section.)

(Troubleshoot issues in this section. Separate issues by best describing the error with a new section name. Remove this section and subsections if no issues are known.)

=== Issue 1 ===

When X happens, Y is how you fix it.

== See also ==

(Optional section.)

* [[Article_name]] - (Link to related Gentoo Wiki articles using bullet points for each link in this section; each link should be local to the Wiki. Use a dash to separate the link from a reason why the link was decided upon.)

== External resources ==

(Optional section.)

* (Link to external resources (outside the Wiki) using bullet points in this section. It is common for the information in this section to full sentences that are links.)

== References ==

(Optional section. Remove this section if references are not used. This section is used to cite factual information. This information is found outside the Gentoo Wiki and used to back up truth claims. The actual references themselves still be littered throughout the main article.)
