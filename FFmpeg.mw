The above list is non-comprehensive. Use <tt>equery</tt> (part of {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}) to see all available flags:

{{Cmd|equery uses media-video/ffmpeg}}

=== Emerge ===

After setting appropriate USE flags, <tt>emerge</tt> FFmpeg:

{{Emerge|media-video/ffmpeg}}

== Configuration ==

This section needs some help.

== Usage ==

=== Media player (ffplay) ===
