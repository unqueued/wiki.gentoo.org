Arx Libertatis is a cross-platform, open source port of Arx Fatalis, a 2002 first-person role-playing game / dungeon crawler developed by Arkane Studios. It features crafting, melee and ranged combat, as well as a unique casting system where the player draws runes in real time to effect the desired spell.
It's a very dark and immersive RPG with cool fights, deep story and lots of ways to interact with the world around you (bake bread!). There is currently also a demo available (arx-fatalis-demo) and a data ebuild for ''cd'' and ''gog'' versions (arx-fatalis-data).
