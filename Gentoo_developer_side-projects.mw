Gentoo is a large place. There's many developers present in Gentoo. The majority of them have highly specialized interests. The purpose of this article is to list some of our developers and their side projects (the stuff they work on outside of Gentoo or in their spare time).

Think of it as a 'one-stop-shop' to view some of the past and present talent in the Gentoo developer community.
