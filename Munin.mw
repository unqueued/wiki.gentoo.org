Munin is a networked resource monitoring tool that can help analyze resource trends and "what just happened to kill our performance?" problems.

Munin implements a master and slave node structure; one master node with many slave nodes. The master node gathers data from the slave nodes, and produces HTML output. Generally these will be placed in the directory accessible via a web server, and can be viewed with a web browser.

== USE flags ==
{{USEflag|package=net-analyzer/munin
|asterisk
|irc
|java
|memcached
|minimal
|mysql
|postgres
|ssl
|cgi
|ipv6
|syslog
}}

== Installation ==
Munin needs a web server such as [[Apache2]], [[Lighttpd]], or [[nginx]]. 
It assumed the web server root is located in {{Path|/var/www/localhost/htdocs/}}

Install the base package {{Package|net-analyzer/munin}}
{{Emerge|params=--ask --verbose| net-analyzer/munin}}

== Single node configuration ==
Install the munin cronjob
{{Emerge|params=--config| net-analyzer/munin}}

The htmldir needs to be set up, the default should be fine {{Path|/var/www/localhost/munin/}}. You have to do nothing if you want to use this path, so the next two instructions are only needed if only if you decided to change this path.

Configure a path where munin should saves generated pages and graphs:
{{File|/etc/munin/munin.conf||<pre>
htmldir /var/www/localhost/htdocs/munin
</pre>}}

This htmldir has to be writeable for the user <code>munin</code>
{{RootCmd|chown munin:munin /var/www/localhost/htdocs/munin}}
{{RootCmd|chmod 755 /var/www/localhost/htdocs/munin}}

Enable <code>crontab</code> for <code>munin</code>, by adding <code>munin</code> to the <code>cron</code> group.
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a munin cron}}

Configure munin which statistics to gather
{{RootCmd|sudo -u munin munin-node-configure --shell}}

This command checks your system for statistics that can be gathered and creates symlinks in the {{Path|/etc/munin/}} directory. 
You should check this list as it will only show shell commands. Once you are happy you can do it for real!
{{RootCmd|sudo -u munin munin-node-configure --shell | /bin/bash}}

Configure munin to start up at boot time
{{RootCmd|rc-update add munin-node default}}

Start the munin daemon
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/munin-node start}}

== Complete ==
Wait a while for munin to output the first set of graphs, the cronjob is run once every 5 minutes by default. Once the graphs have been generated they will be accessible at your web server, usually at <code>http://localhost/munin/</code>, and are saved at the <code>htmldir</code> path (as set in {{Path|/etc/munin/munin.conf}}.

== Troubleshooting ==
The most common problem is graphs are not generated. 
Check for problems by executing <code>/usr/bin/munin-cron</code>
{{RootCmd|sudo -u munin /usr/bin/munin-cron}}

Common errors include not restarting <code>munin-node</code> after adding plugins.
