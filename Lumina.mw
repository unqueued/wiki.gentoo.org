Lumina is a lightweight [[desktop environment]], free of dbus and *kit, designed to require as few system dependencies and requirements as possible.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Recommendation is to use {{package|x11-wm/lumina}} version 1.2.0 or higher. As long it isn't marked stable it should be added to [[:/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|package.keywords]].  

{{Emerge|x11-wm/lumina}}

[https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/5002 lumina-1.3.0] is not yet in the [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/ Gentoo ebuild repository]. For alternative [[ebuild]]s from other [[Ebuild repository|repositories]] see [http://gpo.zugaina.org/x11-wm/lumina gpo.zugaina.org].

=== Configuration ===

A configuration file is installed in {{path|/etc/luminaDesktop.conf}}.  Lumina also has a bunch of own [http://www.lumina-desktop.org/handbook/luminaconfig.html configuration tools].

== Invocation ==

Lumina provides its own replacement for {{c|[[Xorg/Guide#Using_startx|startx]]}} to be started from console.

{{Cmd|start-lumina-desktop}}

Alternatively it can be added to the {{Path|~./xinitrc}} file for being started via {{c|[[Xorg/Guide#Using_startx|startx]]}} or a [[display manager]]

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/X_resources#Adding_to_xinitrc
[[ -f ~/.Xresources ]] && xrdb -merge -I$HOME ~/.Xresources
exec start-lumina-desktop
}}
