This article explains how to capture the kernel crash dumps ('''kdump'''). Kdumps are produced by kernel panic or lockup.
To be simple, just a single kernel is used both for the ordinary system and recovery. The described method is almost distribution independent.

This article is based on [http://rich0gentoo.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/kdump-on-gentoo/ KDump on Gentoo] by {{User|rich0}} (a Gentoo developer), and the first version is posted by the author.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|1=
Processor type and features --->
    [*] kexec system call
    [*] kernel crash dumps
    [*] Build a relocatable kernel
Kernel hacking  --->
    [*] Kernel debugging
    Compile-time checks and compiler options --->
        [*] Compile the kernel with debug info
File systems  --->
    Pseudo filesystems  --->
        -*- /proc file system support
        [*]   /proc/vmcore support
}}

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/kexec-tools}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|sys-apps/kexec-tools}}:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/kexec-tools}}

== Configuration ==

=== local.d script ===

Create {{Path|/etc/local.d/kdump.start}} containing:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/kdump.start|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/bash
kexec -p /[path-to-kernel] --append="root=[root-device] single irqpoll maxcpus=1 reset_devices"
}}

When using an [[initramfs]], a reference to it will need passed as a parameter. For example:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/kdump.start|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/bash
kexec -p /boot/kernel-genkernel-x86_64-3.16.1-gentoo \
      --initrd=/boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-3.16.1-gentoo \
      --append="root=/dev/mapper/lvm-slash single irqpoll maxcpus=1 reset_devices dolvm softlevel=kdump"
}}

Now make this file executable:

{{RootCmd|chmod u+x /etc/local.d/kdump.start}}

Note the kernel has to be readable. A typical Gentoo configuration leaves {{Path|/boot}} unmounted, so either remove ''noauto'' from the [[fstab]] file or place a copy of the kernel in a place that is mounted during a crash.

=== Bootloader ===

Add the <code>crashkernel=64M</code> argument to the kernel command-line via the bootloader (most likely [[GRUB2]]) for systems with up to around 12 GB of RAM. 

== Usage ==

First, run the above script:

{{RootCmd|/etc/local.d/kdump.start}}

It loads the rescue kernel image which is run after kernel crash.

Whenever a kernel panic or lockup (hard/soft if the kernel is set to detect them) occurs, {{c|kexec}} runs the kernel in crash mode, relocated to a reserved area of memory. The rest of RAM will be untouched. When the system boots up log in and copy {{Path|/proc/vmcore}} to a file - this is the crash dump. Then reboot the system to get back to a normal configuration; the system might not be stable and should not continue to operate in this state.

A kernel panic can be forced on demand by executing the following command (do not forget to save all data, log-out other users, and leave the filesystems in a clean state by the invocation of the {{c|sync}} command before doing this):

{{RootCmd|echo c {{!}} tee /proc/sysrq-trigger}}
