[[Category:Kernel]]
There are a lot of posts about kdump you'll find on Google, but most are distro-specific and leave out how to actually make it work if it isn't already configured.  The best post I've found is [http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/kdump/ this one], which this procedure is largely based on.

To keep things simple I'm going to just use a single kernel for the system and recovery, which creates just a few limitations on your kernel configuration.
# emerge kexec-tools - you won't get anywhere without this.
# Check your kernel configuration for the following settings:
#:<code>CONFIG_KEXEC=y<br />
#:CONFIG_SYSFS=y<br />
#:CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=Y  </code>(technically not needed, but what's the point)<br />
#:<code>
#:CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP=y<br />
#:CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE=y<br />
#:CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y</code>
# Edit your grub.conf and add to your boot line crashkernel=64M for up to around 12GB of system RAM
# Create /etc/local.d/kdump.start containing (don't forget to chmod it a+x):<br />
#:<code>#!/bin/bash<br />
#:<br />
#:kexec -p /[path-to-kernel] --append="root=[root-device] single irqpoll maxcpus=1 reset_devices"</code>

That's it.  Note that your kernel has to be reachable, and the typical gentoo config leaves /boot unmounted, so you'll either need to remove noauto from your fstab or place a copy of your kernel elsewhere.  

I didn't get this working with an initramfs - this is supposed to be possible but obviously the more complexity the trickier.

With these changes whenever you get a kernel panic or lockup (hard/soft if the kernel is set to detect them) the system will use kexec to run the kernel in crash mode, relocated to a reserved area of memory.  The rest of RAM will be untouched.  When the system boots up log in and copy /proc/vmcore to a file - this is your crash dump.  Then reboot your system to get back to a normal configuration - you shouldn't continue to operate in this state.
