'''GNOME''' is a feature-rich desktop provided by the [http://www.gnome.org GNOME Project]. It is one of the most widely-used desktops for Linux. It has been an important part of Gentoo for many years.

Because it is so rich, "emerge gnome" requires a long time to complete. It installs a large collection of applications.

See [[GNOME/Configuration|the GNOME Configuration HOWTO]] for more information on installing and using GNOME.

==GNOME 2==
GNOME2 is a 2D desktop with 3D extensions.

==GNOME 3==
GNOME 3 is considered by many to be a radical departure. It needs 3D graphics capability by default, but will run in a software rendering mode if the hardware does not support 3D. 

==== Regional Format and Localization ====
The display format of Dates, Times, Number, Currency and Measurement Unit can be changed according to your region via ''System Settings -> Region & Language -> Formats''. 
{{Note|You can only add (+ Button) and select the regions for which you have '''generated locales''' on your system. For more information on generating locales read [[Localization/HOWTO#Generating_Specific_Locales|this section]] on the [[Localization/HOWTO|Gentoo Localization Howto]].}}

==== GUIÂ user's guide ====
GNOME 3's GUI is a total upheaval for users of GNOME 2. Getting familiar with it, at leat for its basics,  is a matter of minutes provided the user is directed to the right entry point. A  rather good entry point to quickly get familiar with this new GUI is the [https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/index.html.en GNOME Help] page.
