'''GNOME''' is a feature-rich desktop provided by the [https://www.gnome.org GNOME Project]. It is one of the most widely-used desktops for Linux. It has been an important part of Gentoo for many years.

Portage currently has Gnome version 3, that features a redesigned UI, which is a total upheaval for users of GNOME 2. Getting familiar with it, at least for its basics, only takes a matter of minutes provided the user is directed to the right entry point. A rather good entry point to quickly get familiar with this new UI is the [https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/index.html.en GNOME Help] page.

See the [[GNOME/Guide|GNOME Guide]] sub-article for a more detailed approach on installing, configuring, and using GNOME.
