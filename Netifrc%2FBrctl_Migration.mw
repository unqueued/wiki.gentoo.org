These days {{Package|sys-apps/iproute2}} utility can manage bridges, it is superior than using the old specific utilities, among others is the {{Package|net-misc/bridge-utils}}'s brctl. Modern Linux expose bridge setting via sysfs, as result there is no need for iproute2 to support complex configuration.

== brctl Migration to iproute2 ==

The migration of brctl to iproute can be done in two phases:
# Migrate bridge configuration to sysfs, this can be done in stable {{Package|net-misc/netifrc}}.
# Migrate bridge management into iproute2 and drop brctl usage, this requires {{Package|net-misc/netifrc}} master.

Once sysfs migration is completed, migration to iproute2 will be done as soon as netifrc supports iproute2, at this time {{Package|net-misc/bridge-utils}} can be safely removed from system.

==== brctl syntax ====

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
brctl_\${NAME}="brctl-option value
brctl-option value
brctl-option port value
..."
}}

==== sysfs syntax ====

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
\${sysfs_option}_\${NAME}=value
}}

== Migration ==

=== Bridge Interface Settings ===

These are setting of the bridge master device, the name of interface is the bridge name.

=== Bridge Slave (Port) Settings ===

These are setting of the bridge slave device (port), the name of interface is the slave name.

=== Examples ===

==== stp ====

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
brctl_br0="setfd 15
sethello 2
stp on"
}}

Becomes:

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
forward_delay_br0=1500
sethello_br0=200
stp_state_br0=1
}}

==== port ====

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
brctl_br0="setbridgeprio 50
setportprio eth0 60"
}}

Becomes:

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
priority_br0=50
priority_eth0=60
}}
