<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Gentoo Kernel CI is the Gentoo Kernel Continuous Integration system.
Gentoo Kernel CI is checking all the Gentoo kernels pushed by the Gentoo Kernel Team.
GkernelCI is based on buildbot and is currently checking only amd64 architecture.
We still need to implement more testings and architectures.
