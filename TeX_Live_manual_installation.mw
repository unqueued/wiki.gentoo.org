Gentoo provides [[TeX_Live | packages for TeX Live]] in the official tree, but they are [[Project:TeX/Tex_Live_Bump_Story | very difficult to update]]. The TeX Live packages in the tree are several months (sometimes a year) behind upstream, while users who install TeX Live manually with the tlmgr manager get updates every day.

This procedure is very similar to other package managers like pip in python or the package managers of GNU R (using cran), and Perl (using cpan).

This page collects user experience and hints about the manual installation

==Manual installation==
Get the latest installer from https://www.tug.org/texlive/ and follow the instructions to install to {{Path|/usr/local}}.

== Dependencies ==
The manual TeX Live installation provides many packages, which could be installed via Portage too. 
To prevent Portage to install {{Package|app-text/texlive}} as dependency, one can add the package names in a .provided file:

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/profile/package.provided/texlive.provided]]|lang=text|title=|1=
app-text/texlive-2016
app-text/texlive-core-2016-r2
dev-texlive/texlive-basic-2016
dev-tex/revtex-4.1_p2-r1
dev-tex/tex4ht-20090611_p1038-r4
dev-tex/latexdiff-1.2.0
dev-texlive/texlive-fontsextra-2016
dev-texlive/texlive-fontsrecommended-2016
dev-texlive/texlive-fontutils-2016
}}

== Updates ==
{{RootCmd|tlmgr update --all}}

== Trouble ahead ==
The manual installation of TeX Live bears the chance of other conflicts and bugs than a Portage installed TeX Live. 
Keep track of all commands regarding the administration of TeX. 
The using the package manager of the distribution and of a software suite on the same system is always a challenge.
