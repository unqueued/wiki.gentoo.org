{{GSoCIdea|year=2019|BLAS and LAPACK runtime switching|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package) are important mathematical libraries widely used in science, engineering, data science and other areas.

Gentoo supports a large number of BLAS and LAPACK implementations, but {{Bug|632624|text=switching between them is not implemented properly}}. There are [https://github.com/gentoo/sci/issues/805 several approaches] proposed and even [https://github.com/gentoo/sci/pull/837 draft implementation for build-time switching] is available.

Your goal will be to implement blas and lapack eclasses for run-time switching and port at least some of existing ebuilds to the new framework.
