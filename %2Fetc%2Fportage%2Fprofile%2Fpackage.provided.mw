The {{Path|/etc/portage/profile/package.provided}} file can contain a list of packages (one per line) that Portage should assume have been provided. This is useful for porting to non-Linux systems. It is essentially a list that replaces the <tt>emerge --inject</tt> syntax.

For example, to manage a copy of the 4.0 kernel, Portage can be told that sys-kernel/vanilla-sources-4.0.2 has been installed.

Portage will not attempt to update a package that is listed in {{Path|/etc/portage/profile/package.provided}} file unless another package explicitly requires a version that is ''newer'' than what has been listed. Dependencies that are satisfied by {{Path|package.provided}} entries may cause installed packages satisfying equivalent dependencies to be removed by <tt>emerge --depclean</tt> actions (see the ACTIONS section of the emerge man page for more information).

== Format ==

* Comments begin with <code>#</code> (no inline comments).
* One DEPEND atom per line.
* Relational operators are not allowed.
* Must include a version.

== Example ==

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/profile/package.provided|title=package.provided example|1=
# To take care of the kernel
sys-kernel/vanilla-sources-4.0.2

# To install a special copy of QT
dev-qt/qtcore-5.4.1

# To have modular X but packages want monolithic
x11-base/xorg-x11-7.4-r2
}}
