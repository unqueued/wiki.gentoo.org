'''Xorg''' is an open source implementation of the X Window System.

== Installation ==

There are many ways to get the X server in Gentoo, however a common method is to emerge one of the two packages:

* {{Package|x11-base/xorg-server}} - Installs the necessary components for a minimally operational X server.
* {{Package|x11-base/xorg-x11}} - Installs a large Xorg software suite.

As seen from the descriptions above, those who desire a more minimal X server implementation should choose the first package.

=== USE flags ===

==== xorg-server ====

{{USEflag|package=x11-base/xorg-server}}

==== xorg-x11 ====

{{USEflag|package=x11-base/xorg-x11}}

{{Note|This metapackage does not have any USE flags of its own.}}

==== The X USE flag ====

Many packages can be built with optional x11 support by activating the global [https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/X X] USE flag (if not already activated by [[profile]] selection).

=== Emerge ===

==== xorg-server ====

Just the necessary components:

{{Emerge|x11-base/xorg-server}}

==== xorg-x11 ====

The full Xorg suite via the meta package:

{{Emerge|x11-base/xorg-x11}}

{{Note|Getting a working graphical environment (including popular desktops like KDE and Gnome) requires additional configuration '''before''' emerging one of these packages. See the more extensive [[Xorg/Guide|Xorg Guide]] for details.}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== X server starts and dies unexpectedly with no errors ===

'''Problem''': Running {{c|startx}} will start the X server, however it will immediately die without any errors (searching "<code>EE</code>" in {{Path|/var/log/Xorg.0.log}} returns no related results).

'''Cause''': an empty {{Path|.xinitrc}} file exists for the user who is running the {{c|startx}} command, so the X server is starting, then stopping because there is nothing left for it to do.

'''Resolution''': Either remove the {{Path|.xinitrc}} file or define a window manager inside it.

'''Reproducible''' via:

{{Cmd|touch ~/.xinitrc}}
