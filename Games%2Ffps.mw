Urban Terror is is a free multiplayer first person shooter based on the ioquake3 engine. It can be described as a hollywood tactical shooter; somewhat realism based, but the motto is "fun over realism". This results in a very unique, enjoyable and addictive game which reminds of ''Counter Strike'', but is more action and speed oriented.
