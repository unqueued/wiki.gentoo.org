The physics is based on the Quake II physics, but also allows dodging. It also features single-player matches against bots.

The true legend. Quake III Arena is a multiplayer shooter focussing on competitive matches, be it duel, capture the flag, instagib, deathmatch,... It has defined modern tournament shooters and still has an active community. The portage version uses the ioquake3 engine which is kind of a fork based on the source code release of the original Quake III in 2005. There are tons of mods and extension packs available in portage (such as {{Package|games-fps/quake3-matrix}} or {{Package|games-fps/quake3-nsco}}), as well as a data ebuild ({{Package|games-fps/quake3-data}}) and a demo ebuild ({{Package|games-fps/quake3-demo}}).
