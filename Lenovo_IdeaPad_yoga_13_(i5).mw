= Configuration details =
== Display ==

Backlight control through brithness buttons is enabled by adding the ''' "acpi_backlight=vendor" ''' into the /etc/default/grub, i.e. GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="acpi_backlight=vendor"

== Wireless ==

=== Method 1: Using the kernel driver ===
The r8723au driver provides support for the Realtek RTL8723AU WiFi chipset. The RTL8723AU is the USB version of the Realtek 8723A chipset, with ID of 0bda:1724. Since the version 3.15 of the kernel, the RTL8723AU is supported in the staging drivers. 

'''Step 1ː''' Configure and compile kernel 
{{Kernel||<pre>
<M>   Realtek RTL8723AU Wireless LAN NIC driver  
[*]     Realtek RTL8723AU AP mode
[*]     Realtek RTL8723AU BlueTooth Coexistence
</pre>
}}

{{Note|
The option "Realtek RTL8723AU Wireless LAN NIC driver" in the section ">Device Drivers>Staging drivers" appears if the option "RF switch subsystem support" in the ">Networking options" is enabled.
}}
{{Kernel||<pre>
<M>   RF switch subsystem support  --->
</pre>
}}


'''Step 2:''' The gentoo package sys-kernel/linux-firmware is required.
{{emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}

=== Method 2: Using the lwfinger driver ===
{{Code||<pre>
git clone git@github.com:lwfinger/rtl8723au.git
cd rtl8723au/
make
make install
modprobe rtl8723au
</pre>}}
