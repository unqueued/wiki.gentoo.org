'''rxvt-unicode''', also known simply as urxvt, is a fast and lightweight [[terminal emulator]] with xft and unicode support.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}}

{{Note|Enabling the <code>buffer-on-clear</code> USE flag may result in garbled display of ncurses based programs like {{c|top}} found in {{Package|sys-process/procps}}.}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}}:

{{Emerge|rxvt-unicode}}

== Daemon ==
It is possible to operate urxvt as a daemon, which will lead to lower resource usage and quicker startup for new terminals. It is a good idea to start the daemon at the beginning of the X session.

The following can be used to start the daemon and fork it into the background.
{{Cmd|urxvtd --quiet --opendisplay --fork}}
After this, new clients can be opened on the single daemon process, rather than spawning new processes for each terminal. To do this, simply run `urxvtc' in place of the usual `urxvt' command.

== Configuration ==
Configuration for urxvt is done mainly through the [[Wikipedia:X resources|X resources]] system, though command line equivalents are also available in most cases. A full list of these options can be found in the urxvt manpage. Some common configuration options are listed below. 

=== .xinitrc ===
If you are using {{Path|.xinitrc}}, it is possible {{Path|.Xresources}} will not be read. To fix this, add the following to {{Path|.xinitrc}}
{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|1=
[[ -f ~/.Xresources ]] && xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
}}

=== Font ===
Rxvt-unicode's font can be configured using either [[Wikipedia:X logical font description|XLFD]] notation or, provided the package was compiled with the ''xft'' USE flag, Xft fonts.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|1=
! Using XLFD (created via e.g. xfontsel)
URxvt*font:           -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-12-90-100-*-c-60-iso8859-1
! Using Xft
URxvt*font:           xft:Inconsolata:size=8
}}

{{Note|In some fonts, depending on the font size Unicode may not work properly.}}

Rendering settings can be tweaked for Xft fonts as well. Note that this is not specific to urxvt.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|1=
!-*-{ Xft settings
Xft*dpi:       96
Xft*antialias: True
Xft*hinting:   Full
!-*-}
}}

=== Scrollbar ===
The look of the scrollbar can changed, or the scrollbar can be removed entirely.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|1=
! Set the style of the scrollbar: rxvt (default), plain, next, xterm
URxvt.scrollstyle: rxvt
! To disable the scrollbar
URxvt.scrollBar: false
}}

=== Printing ===
By default, rxvt-unicode will print out a screen dump, via lpr, when {{Key|PrntScrn}} is pressed. Using {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|PrintScrn}} or {{Key|Shift}}-{{Key|PrintScrn}} will include the terminal's scroll back in the printout as well. This behavior can be changed, or disabled entirely, based on personal preference and need.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|1=
! The string will be interpreted as if typed into the shell as-is.
! In this example, printing will be disabled altogether.
URxvt.print-pipe: "cat > /dev/null"
}}

=== Copy/Paste and URL handling ===
A perl module can be used to get copy/paste and URL handling capabilities. In order to use Perl modules in urxvt, the package must have been compiled with the "perl" USE flag. Additionally, you will need either {{Package|x11-misc/xsel}} or {{Package|x11-misc/xclip}} for copy/paste capabilities. You can get a set of Perl scripts in the package {{Package|x11-misc/urxvt-perls}}. You can also grab the sources of a perl modules from muennich's [https://github.com/muennich/urxvt-perls github] or an [https://github.com/tokiclover/bar-overlay/tree/master/dev-perl/perl-URxvt ebuild] for example. It is possible to get other Perl modules elsewhere on the internet.

Here is an example of a {{path|~/.Xresources}}. The following lines could also be added to {{path|~/.Xdefaults}}, though {{path|~/.Xresources}} is preferred.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|
!-*- Perl extensions -*-
URxvt.perl-ext-common:default,clipboard,matcher,keyboard-select
URxvt.keysym.M-u:     perl:url-select:select_next

URxvt.underlineURLs:  True
URxvt.matcher.button: 1 
URxvt.keysym.M-Escape:perl:keyboard-select:activate
URxvt.keysym.M-c:     perl:clipboard:copy
URxvt.keysym.M-v:     perl:clipboard:paste

!URxvt.copyCommand:   xsel -ib
!URxvt.pasteCommand:  xsel -ob
! Comment this if you don't want copy when text is selected
URxvt.clipboard.autocopy: true
}}

=== Icons ===

==== Menu icon ====
This adds menu entry and menu icon for urxvt.
If urxvt doesn't have a .desktop file, create one.
{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/applications/urxvt.desktop|1=
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Urxvt
Comment=Terminal emulator
TryExec=urxvt
Exec=urxvt
Icon=terminal
Type=Application
Categories=GNOME;GTK;Utility;TerminalEmulator;System;
StartupNotify=true
}}

==== Application icon ====
For setting application icon urxvt has to be compiled with pixbuf USE flag.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|1=
URxvt.iconFile:    /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/Terminal.svg
}}

== Using rxvt-unicode with Powerline fonts ==
Unfortunately current default rxvt-unicode configuration in gentoo uses compromise patches, which break support for Powerline characters.
Overview of the problem: some fonts provide incorrect values for character width, which breaks their appearance in urxvt in various ways.
The Powerline symbols are extra unicode characters, which can be add to a font by "patching" it, or they can be added to the system without patching, using fontconfig settings.
These font often contain wrong width set for the Powerline characters. Some other terminals workaround that, but not urxvt. Gentoo also has a use flag alt-font-width set by default, which alters font width calculation in a fay incompatible with Powerline characters.
As per talk in the urxvt mailing list: http://lists.schmorp.de/pipermail/rxvt-unicode/2016q1/002204.html it should be clear, that to get Powerline symbols to work in urxvt on gentoo you need to disable alt-font-width and enable vanila (not globaly!) USE flags. Then install the Powerline symbols any way you prefer on your system, however be sure not to get an old broken font - in this case it will not be working with urxvt.
