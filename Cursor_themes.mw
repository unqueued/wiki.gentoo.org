== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Check if you already have the cursors you need before installing any new package. Cursors can be found in the {{Path|/usr/share/cursors}} directory.

{{Package|x11-themes/xcursor-themes}} comes with the whiteglass and the redglass themes:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/xcursor-themes}}

=== Additional software ===

Another package with some Gentoo themed cursors is available as well

{{Package|x11-themes/gentoo-xcursors}} comes with gentoo, gentoo-blue, and gentoo-silver cursor themes:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/gentoo-xcursors}}

To install all of the cursor themes available from Portage:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/xcursor-themes x11-themes/gentoo-xcursors x11-themes/haematite-xcursors x11-themes/blueglass-xcursors x11-themes/golden-xcursors x11-themes/pearlgrey-xcursors x11-themes/silver-xcursors x11-themes/vanilla-dmz-xcursors x11-themes/vanilla-dmz-aa-xcursors x11-themes/comix-xcursors x11-themes/obsidian-xcursors x11-themes/xcursor-neutral}}

== Configuration ==

Edit your {{Path|~/.Xresources}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|title=Choose a cursor theme|1=
Xcursor.theme: redglass
}}

Cursor size can be optionally chosen as well:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|title=Choose the cursor size|1=
Xcursor.size: 16
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Cursor keeps going back to default X cursors ===

Some desktop environment, mouse theme changes when hovering otherside of window. Inside the window, the mouse cursor is set what I want. But when go outside of the window(such as i3-bar, i3-status, background, etc), the mouse cursor changes into default X cursor.

Create the symlink to your home path.

{{RootCmd|ln -s /usr/share/cursors/xorg-x11 ~/.icons}}

=== GTK2/GTK3 ===

Some GTK application has the problem which the cursors change to default X cursors when the cursor is in the GTK application. Go to settings.ini and modify the value. Change gtk-theme-name and gtk-cursor-theme-name to what you want. On this example below, we choose 'gentoo'.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini|1=
[Settings]
gtk-theme-name = gentoo
gtk-icon-theme-name = gnome
gtk-cursor-theme-name = gentoo
}}
