== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Check if you already have the cursors you need before installing any new package. Cursors can be found in the {{Path|/usr/share/cursors}} directory.

{{Package|x11-themes/xcursor-themes}} comes with the whiteglass and the redglass themes:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/xcursor-themes}}

=== Additional software ===

Another package with some Gentoo themed cursors is available as well

{{Package|x11-themes/gentoo-xcursors}} comes with gentoo, gentoo-blue, and gentoo-silver cursor themes:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/gentoo-xcursors}}

To install all of the cursor themes available from Portage:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/xcursor-themes x11-themes/gentoo-xcursors x11-themes/haematite-xcursors x11-themes/blueglass-xcursors x11-themes/golden-xcursors x11-themes/pearlgrey-xcursors x11-themes/silver-xcursors x11-themes/vanilla-dmz-xcursors x11-themes/vanilla-dmz-aa-xcursors x11-themes/comix-xcursors x11-themes/obsidian-xcursors x11-themes/neutral-xcursors}}

== Configuration ==

Edit your {{Path|~/.Xresources}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|title=Choose a cursor theme|1=
Xcursor.theme: redglass
}}

Cursor size can be optionally chosen as well:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|title=Choose the cursor size|1=
Xcursor.size: 16
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Cursor keeps going back to default X cursors ===

In some desktop environments the mouse theme can change when hovering outside of a window. Inside the window the mouse cursor respects the user's choice. But outside the window the mouse cursor changes into the default X cursor.

Create the symlink to your home path.

{{Cmd|ln -s /usr/share/cursors/xorg-x11 ~/.icons}}

=== GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3 ===

With some GTK+ applications the mouse cursor changes to default settings when the it is inside the GTK+ application window. Users can fix this problem by setting the <var>gtk-theme-name</var> and <var>gtk-cursor-theme-name</var> variables in {{Path|~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini}} and {{Path|~/.gtkrc-2.0}}. In the examples below the <code>gentoo</code> cursor theme as been chosen.

For GTK+ 3 applications:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini|1=
[Settings]
gtk-theme-name = gentoo
gtk-icon-theme-name = gnome
gtk-cursor-theme-name = gentoo
}}

For GTK+ 2 applications:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.gtkrc-2.0|1=
gtk-theme-name = gentoo
gtk-icon-theme-name = gnome
gtk-cursor-theme-name = gentoo
}}
