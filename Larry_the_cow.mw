Larry the cow is one of Gentoo's unofficial mascots. Why unofficial? Good question...

== Appearances ==
Here on the Wiki the occasional use of Larry's name can be used as a substitute when needed.

Using Larry's name for this purpose is beneficial for a few reasons:
# It helps establish a ''consistent style'' for readers and editors to keep in mind. Individual contributors now have knowledge of a user name that is readily available for command examples. They will use this name when writing a template that has a field requiring a user name. See the example below;
# Using Larry's name in appropriate places helps the Wiki's documentation feel more comprehensive. Many readers enjoy humor and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_%28media%29 Easter eggs]. Gentoo is not Funtoo, but that does not mean it cannot be fun to read the Wiki!
# It helps Mr. Larry feel more included. Instead of feeling lonely, like he has been off in the pasture all by himself ''for days'', he feels special because people are reading his name more often.

For example, for style points and to help Larry feel included, the <tt>gpasswd</tt> command could be used with Larry's name and an example group instead of simply <code><user></code> and <code><group></code>:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <user> <group>}}
vs.
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a larry wheel}}

Both could work. One method is not better than the other. But the latter method gets more style points.
