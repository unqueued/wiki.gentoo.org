On Saturday 4th February 2017 and Sunday 5th February 2017, the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting FOSDEM 2017 will take place in Brussels, Belgium.

Naturally a Gentoo crowd will be there; this page is intended to collect public information about our presence and help organizing stuff.

== Gentoo stand ==
Gentoo has applied for a Stand this year to follow up on [https://blog.sumptuouscapital.com/2016/01/gentoo-at-fosdem-2016/ last year's successful stand]. Announcement of accepted stands is expected around 14 November 2016

Following last year we expect to announce a new livecd during FOSDEM 2017

== Gentoo-related talks ==
There are currently no reported Gentoo-related talks

== Developers available at FOSDEM ==
