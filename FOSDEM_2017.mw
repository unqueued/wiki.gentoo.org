On Saturday 4th February 2017 and Sunday 5th February 2017, the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting [https://fosdem.org/2017/ FOSDEM 2017] will take place in Brussels, Belgium.

Naturally a Gentoo crowd will be there; this page is intended to collect public information about our presence and help organizing stuff.

== Gentoo stand ==
Gentoo has a stand at FOSDEM 2017, following up [https://blog.sumptuouscapital.com/2016/01/gentoo-at-fosdem-2016/ last year's successful stand]. We are located at [https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/buildings/#k K (level 1, group B) 2] between ReactOS/Haiku and CoreOS.

As last year we expect to announce a new livecd during FOSDEM 2017

The following is an hour-by-hour schedule of who is running the stand. The plan is to have always two devs present, with overlapping two-hour slots (i.e., 10h-12h, 12h-14h, ... and 9h-11h, 11h-13h, 13h-15h, ...) (At start and end there are shorter slots, but these obviously also involve build-up and teardown.)

== Gentoo dinner ==

We'll meet (as every year) for the traditional Gentoo dinner on saturday evening. Since people were quite happy with the food, it'll most likely be at [http://www.woknroll.be/ Wok'n'Roll] again. That's a ~15min walk from the FOSDEM venue; we will meet and leave together after the Distributions devroom closes at 18:55, in front of the lecture hall K.4.601 of that devroom.

Please add yourself to one of the tables above if you want to join, so we can reserve a reasonable amount of places at the restaurant! In case of organization questions, contact {{User|xaviermiller}}.

== Gentoo OpenPGP Web of Trust ==
Gentoo will not host a key signing party this year, but participants are encouraged to exchange and verify OpenPGP key data to build the Gentoo Web of Trust. Please bring printed information of the fingerprint and various UIDs you want certified along with a valid governmental ID matching the UID. You can use a service like [http://openpgp.quelltextlich.at/slip.html] to generate such a key slip.
