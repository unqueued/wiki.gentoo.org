On Saturday 4th February 2017 and Sunday 5th February 2017, the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting [https://fosdem.org/2017/ FOSDEM 2017] took place in Brussels, Belgium.

Naturally a Gentoo crowd was there; this page collected public information about our presence and helped with organizing stuff.

== Gentoo stand ==
Gentoo has a stand at FOSDEM 2017, following up [https://blog.sumptuouscapital.com/2016/01/gentoo-at-fosdem-2016/ last year's successful stand]. We are located at [https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/buildings/#k K (level 1, group B) 2] between ReactOS/Haiku and CoreOS.

As last year we expect to announce a new livecd during FOSDEM 2017

The following is an hour-by-hour schedule of who is running the stand. The plan is to have always two devs present, with overlapping two-hour slots (i.e., 10h-12h, 12h-14h, ... and 9h-11h, 11h-13h, 13h-15h, ...) (At start and end there are shorter slots, but these obviously also involve build-up and teardown.)

== Gentoo dinner ==

=== Sunday ===

We'll meet after the FOSDEM closing talk at the Gentoo booth ca. 18.15. No plans for concrete restaurant yet.

=== Saturday ===

We'll meet (as every year) for the traditional Gentoo dinner on saturday evening. It will take place at [http://www.chezleon.be/ Chez Léon's] in the Centre of Brussels (near the Delirium's). Menu at €30.60 (B3, C2, E4 [http://www.chezleon.be/brochures/en/LEO_1504_goupe_20105_UK_LowRes.pdf page 6]); we will meet and leave together after the Distributions devroom closes at 18:55, in front of the lecture hall K.4.601 of that devroom.

In case of organization questions, contact {{U|xaviermiller}}.

== Gentoo OpenPGP Web of Trust ==
Gentoo will not host a key signing party this year, but participants are encouraged to exchange and verify OpenPGP key data to build the Gentoo Web of Trust. Please bring printed information of the fingerprint and various UIDs you want certified along with a valid governmental ID matching the UID. You can use a service like [http://openpgp.quelltextlich.at/slip.html] to generate such a key slip.
