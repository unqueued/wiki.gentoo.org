On Saturday 4th February 2017 and Sunday 5th February 2017, the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting FOSDEM 2017 will take place in Brussels, Belgium.

Naturally a Gentoo crowd will be there; this page is intended to collect public information about our presence and help organizing stuff.
