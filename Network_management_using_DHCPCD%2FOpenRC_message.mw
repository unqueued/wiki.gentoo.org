Gentoo provides several tools for managing network connections.<ref>Textbox copied from [http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/sys-apps/openrc/openrc-0.12.4.ebuild sys-apps/openrc-0.12.4-ebuild]</ref>

<pre>if ! use newnet && ! use netifrc; then
   ewarn "You have emerged OpenRc without network support. This"
   ewarn "means you need to SET UP a network manager such as"
   ewarn " net-misc/netifrc, net-misc/dhcpcd, net-misc/wicd,"
   ewarn "net-misc/NetworkManager, or net-misc/badvpn."
   ewarn "Or, you have the option of emerging openrc with the newnet"
   ewarn "use flag and configuring /etc/conf.d/network and"
   ewarn "/etc/conf.d/staticroute if you only use static interfaces."</pre>

The easiest of them to use is dhcpcd.<ref>[[Network_management_using_DHCPCD]]</ref> It has perfect integration for wpa_supplicant<ref>[[Wpa_supplicant]]</ref> and automatically switches between wired and wireless connections.  In case of using dhcpcd as network manager, the USE flags netifrc and newnet may be deactivated in OpenRC. 
{{USEflag
|package=sys-apps/openrc
|netifrc+yes+no+enable Gentoo's network stack (net.* scripts)
|newnet++no
}}

Gentoo's standard however for network management is using Gentoo net.* scripts.<ref>[[Handbook:Parts/Networking/Introduction]]</ref>
