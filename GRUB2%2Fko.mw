'''GRUB2'''는 최신 컴퓨터 시스템을 지원하는 부트로더입니다. 이는 종전의 [[GRUB]] 부트로더(현재는 "GRUB Legacy"라고 함)를 대체함을 의미합니다. GRUB2는 GRUB Legacy와는 달리 코드 기반이 완전히 다르며, 고급 스크립팅 기능을 사용할 수 있는 새로운 쉘-유사 문법 같은 기능을 뽐냅니다. 현재 GRUB Legacy 사용자는 GRUB2로 이전하시는 것이 좋습니다.

한방에 접근하시려면 [[GRUB2 Quick Start]]를 보십시오.

== 설치 ==

{{Package|sys-boot/grub}} 꾸러미는 슬롯으로 나누었습니다. grub-0.97 ([[GRUB|GRUB Legacy]])와 grub-2.00는 동시에 설치할 수 있지만 한번에 버전 하나만 MBR에 설치합니다. 이 게시글은 GRUB2에 집중합니다.

기본적으로 GRUB2는 빌드 시간에 기본 플랫폼 대상을 추측합니다. {{Path|make.conf}}의 <var>GRUB_PLATFORMS</var> 변수를 설정하여 우선 적용할 수 있습니다.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=EMU, EFI, PC를 지원하도록 GRUB_PLATFORMS 변수를 설정하는 예제|lang=bash|1=

}}

대상 CPU에 따라 다음 플랫폼을 지원합니다:

GRUB2를 설치하려면 일반적인 emerge 문법을 사용하십시오:

{{Emerge|sys-boot/grub:2|params+=--newuse}}

추가로, {{c|os-prober}} 유틸리티({{Package|sys-boot/os-prober}} 꾸러미에 있음)를 설치하여 {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} 명령을 실행할 때 GRUB2가 다른 운영체제도 찾을 수 있도록 하십시오. 대부분의 경우, 이런 조치를 통해 GRUB2에서 다른 운영체제를 자동으로 감지하는 동작을 활성화합니다(Windows 7, Windows 8.1, 등).

{{Emerge|sys-boot/os-prober|params+=--newuse}}

GRUB2(그리고 추가로 {{Package|sys-boot/os-prober}}도) 설치는 부트 로더를 자동으로 활성화하지 않습니다. 단지 이 설치 과정은 운영체제에 프로그램을 설치하는 과정일 뿐이지만, 시스템 자체에 부트 로더를 설치(하여 시스템을 부팅할 때 부트로터를 사용)하려면, [[#.EC.84.A4.EC.A0.95|설정]] 부분에서 다루는 추가 과정을 거쳐야합니다.

== 설정 ==

GRUB2 설정에 중요한 두가지 부분이 있습니다:
# GRUB2 프로그램을 시스템의 부트로더로 설치합니다.
# GRUB2 부트로더 자체를 설정합니다.

GRUB2 프로그램의 설치는 시스템 형태에 따르며, [[#.EB.B6.80.ED.8A.B8_.EB.A1.9C.EB.8D.94_.EC.84.A4.EC.B9.98|부트로더 설치]] 에서 다룹니다. 우선 부트로더 자체 설정을 다루겠습니다.

=== 주 설정 파일 ===

The {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} script is used to generate a grub configuration. It uses the scripts under {{Path|/etc/grub.d/*}} together with the {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} configuration file to generate the final {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} - the only configuration file used by GRUB2 itself. 

{| class="table"
|-
! File !! Format !! Edits recommended? !! Description
|-
| {{Path|/usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig}} || POSIX shell script || {{No}} || Installed as part of the {{Package|sys-boot/grub}}:2 package. Run this script to generate {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} after configuring the files described below.
|-
| {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} || GRUB2 shell script || {{No}} || The file generated by {{c|grub2-mkconfig}}. This file is evaluated by GRUB2's built-in script interpreter and doesn't necessarily support all POSIX commands or syntax. See the [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Shell_002dlike-scripting scripting reference] in the GRUB manual for supported features. Be aware that modifications to this file won't persist to the next time grub2-mkconfig is run.
|-
| {{Path|/etc/grub.d/*}} || POSIX shell scripts || {{Partial|Maybe}} || Each script under {{Path|/etc/grub.d/*}} that has its execute bit set is evaluated in sequence, and the stdout is concatenated to form the final {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} (or whatever file is given to the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} <code>-o</code> option). These scripts use the current system shell and therefore can use any supported syntax. Ideally they should be POSIX-compatible scripts, and the output script must be compatible with the GRUB2 interpreter. It may be necessary to disable or add scripts. For instance, to add menu items that couldn't be automatically generated.
|-
| {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} || POSIX shell script || {{Yes}} || In most cases this is the only file that should be modified directly. It is mainly used to assign variables used by the scripts in {{Path|/etc/grub.d}} to generate a working configuration file. See [[GRUB2/Config_Variables|GRUB2 configuration variables]] or the [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Simple-configuration official reference] for supported variables.
|}

GRUB2 does not require the administrator to manually maintain a boot option configuration (as is the case with boot loaders such as [[GRUB|GRUB Legacy]] and [[LILO]]). Instead it can generate its configuration file ({{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}}) using the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} command. This utility will use the scripts in {{Path|/etc/grub.d/}} and the settings in {{Path|/etc/default/grub}}.

{{Warning|The {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} utility does not work properly when using software RAID. Manual configuration of the scripts in {{Path|/etc/grub.d/}} is necessary, as otherwise after installation the system will be left in a non-bootable state.
}}

After modifying one or more settings, run the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} utility with the <code>-o</code> option pointing to the output file located at {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} (this is GRUB2's default output location):

{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg|output=<pre>
Generating grub.cfg ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.3.0-gentoo
done
</pre>}}

Each time the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} utility is called a new configuration will be generated. 

{{Warning|If {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} does not report any found entries then no entries were found. In this case GRUB2 will offer no boot selections when upon system restart which may be a tricky, time consuming situation to resolve. Make sure the output is satisfactory before restarting the system.}}

=== Setting configuration parameters ===

The following variables in {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} are the most common ones to set to control how GRUB2 will function:

{| class="table"
! Variable
! Explanation
! Default value
|-
| <var>GRUB_DEFAULT</var>
| Defines the default menu entry selected on boot. May be a numeric index, a menu title, or "saved". 
| Defaults to first detected entry.
|-
| <var>GRUB_TIMEOUT</var> 
| Delay (in seconds) before booting default menu entry. Set to <code>0</code> to boot immediately or <code>-1</code> to wait indefinitely. 
| The default is 5 seconds.
|-
| <var>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX</var>
| Parameters to be passed on the kernel command line for all Linux menu entries. For instance, to support hibernation, users will need to add <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="resume=/dev/sdXY"</code> with {{Path|/dev/sdXY}} being the swap partition.
| 
|-
| <var>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</var>
| Parameters to be passed on the kernel command line for non-recovery Linux menu entries.
| 
|-
| <var>GRUB_DEVICE</var> 
| The initial root device (i.e. the kernel's <code>root=</code> parameter). Set this to override the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} command's root device auto-detection. For example, <code>GRUB_DEVICE=/dev/ram0</code> will force <code>root=/dev/ram0</code> to be used in the kernel command line.
| 
|}

For a more complete list, please refer to the [[GRUB2/Config_Variables|GRUB2 configuration variables]] sub-page.

After modifying the parameters, regenerate the GRUB2 configuration file with {{c|grub2-mkconfig}}.

=== Enabling or disabling configuration scripts ===

The directory {{Path|/etc/grub.d/}} contains the scripts that {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} uses to generate a {{Path|grub.cfg}} file. By default the contents of this directory should be similar to the following:

{{Cmd|ls /etc/grub.d/|output=<pre>
00_header  10_linux  20_linux_xen  30_os-prober  40_custom  41_custom README
</pre>}}

GRUB2 will use all installed scripts that are marked as executable (which by default, they all are). To disable any of the scripts simply remove the executable bit from the script's file permissions using the {{c|chmod}} command. In the following example every script but {{Path|00_header}} and {{Path|10_linux}} are disabled:

{{RootCmd|chmod -x /etc/grub.d/<nowiki>{</nowiki>20_linux_xen,30_os-prober,40_custom,41_custom<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}

After modifying the scripts (or removing the executable bit), regenerate the GRUB2 configuration file using {{c|grub2-mkconfig}}.

=== 설정 스크립트 다루기 ===

Some features or GRUB2 functionalities are only possible to be exploited by modifying the configuration scripts. For instance, to support dual-booting with FreeBSD, the following manipulation needs to be done.

Change the {{Path|/etc/grub.d/40_custom}} script to:  

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/grub.d/40_custom|title=듀얼 부팅 추가|<pre>
menuentry "FreeBSD" --class freebsd --class bsd --class os {
 insmod ufs2
 insmod bsd
 set root=(hd0,1)
 kfreebsd /boot/kernel/kernel
 kfreebsd_loadenv /boot/device.hints
 set kFreeBSD.vfs.root.mountfrom=ufs:/dev/ada0s1a
 set kFreeBSD.vfs.root.mountfrom.options=rw
 set kFreeBSD.hw.psm.synaptics_support=1
}
</pre>}}

{{Path|/dev/sda1}} or <code>(hd0,1)</code> is the partition in which FreeBSD resides. If the normal UFS install was used for the FreeBSD partition then {{Path|/dev/sda1}} is a container (something like a logical partition). It consists of the swap and root partition. Verify the {{Path|40_custom}} script is executable by running {{c|ls -la /etc/grub.d/40_custom}}. If the executable bit is not set then set it using the {{c|chmod u+x 40_custom}} command.  

Next install GRUB2 using the {{c|grub2-install}} command and update GRUB2's configuration file:

{{RootCmd|grub2-install /dev/sda
|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

== 부트 로더 설치==

Installing GRUB2 as the system's boot loader depends on how the system is meant to boot (through BIOS or UEFI) and how the disk on which the boot loader should be installed is partitioned (using MBR or GPT partition layout).

This article covers the following situations:

* [[#BIOS with MBR|BIOS with MBR]]
* [[#BIOS with GPT|BIOS with GPT]]
* [[#UEFI with GPT|UEFI with GPT]]

Select the installation instructions appropriate for the system.

=== BIOS with MBR ===

{{Note|When the system is meant to dual-boot with Microsoft Windows, make sure that the system itself does ''not'' have an EFI firmware. Even when such systems are booted in 'legacy BIOS' mode, Microsoft Windows will refuse to boot.}}

Make sure that the {{Path|/boot}} location is available - if this uses a separate partition, make sure that it is mounted:

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}

Run the {{c|grub2-install}} command to copy the relevant files to {{Path|/boot/grub}}. On the PC platform, this also installs a boot image to the Master Boot Record (MBR) or a partition's boot sector. If all goes well, after running {{c|grub2-install}} an output such as the one below is to be expected:

{{RootCmd|grub2-install /dev/sda|output=<pre>
Installation finished. No error reported.
</pre>}}

{{c|grub2-install}} accepts a <code>--target</code> option to set the CPU architecture and system platform. If unspecified, {{c|grub2-install}} will attempt to guess the proper values; on an {{Keyword|amd64}}/{{Keyword|x86}} system it will use <code>i386-pc</code> by default. {{c|grub2-install}} also accepts a <code>--boot-directory</code> option to tell the GRUB2 installer which directory to look for GRUB2's boot files. This defaults to the current {{Path|/boot}} but is useful when trying to move a root partition.

==== Partitioning for BIOS with MBR ====

Be sure to leave enough free space before the first partition. Starting the first partition at sector 2048 leaves at least 1 MiB of disk space for the master boot record. It is recommended (but not mandatory) to create an additional partition for GRUB called the ''BIOS boot partition''. This partition just needs to be defined, but not formatted.

If the [[Handbook:Main_Page|Gentoo installation instructions]] were followed, this BIOS boot partition will already be available.

=== BIOS with GPT ===

{{Note|When the system is meant to dual-boot with Microsoft Windows, make sure that the system itself does ''not'' have an EFI firmware. Even when such systems are booted in 'legacy BIOS' mode, Microsoft Windows will refuse to boot. Also, older Microsoft Windows systems might not support GPT. It is possible to use a hybrid MBR-GPT approach, see [[Hybrid partition table]].}}

If a {{Path|/boot}} partition is needed, start by mounting the {{Path|/boot}} partition:

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}

If all goes well, after running the {{c|grub2-install}} command an output such as the one below is to be expected:

{{RootCmd|grub2-install /dev/sda|output=<pre>
Installation finished. No error reported.
</pre>}}

{{c|grub2-install}} accepts a <code>--target</code> option to set the CPU architecture and system platform. If unspecified, {{c|grub2-install}} will attempt to guess the correct at the correct values; on an {{Keyword|amd64}}/{{Keyword|x86}} system it will use <code>i386-pc</code> by default. {{c|grub2-install}} also accepts a <code>--boot-directory</code> option to tell the GRUB2 installer which directly to look for GRUB2's boot files. This defaults to the current {{Path|/boot}} but is useful when trying to move a root partition.

==== Partitioning for BIOS with GPT ====

When a GPT partition table is present on the system, a small ''BIOS boot partition'' with type <code>EF02</code> (which is different from the ''EFI System Partition (ESP)'' which has type <code>EF00</code>) will need to be available. 1 MiB will be enough to work but 2-4 MiB is a safer option. This BIOS boot partition will hold the stage 2 of the bootloader. BIOS boot partitions do not need formatted with a filesystem; the {{c|grub2-install}} command will overwrite any pre-existing filesystem with one of its own.

{{Important|Readers should be aware the BIOS boot partition is ''not'' the same partition that is commonly mounted at {{Path|/boot}}. The {{Path|/boot}} and BIOS boot different partitions and should be handled separately. BIOS boot partition should ''not'' be regularly mounted on the system (e.g. it should ''not'' be defined in {{Path|/etc/fstab}}). The {{Path|/boot}} partition ''can'' be regularly mounted with no issues and therefore can be present in the {{Path|/etc/fstab}} file.}}

To set a partition as a BIOS partition use the command line tool {{c|parted}} ({{Package|sys-block/parted}}) by typing (change <code>1</code> to the number of the partition to mark as a BIOS boot partition!):

{{RootCmd|set 1 bios_grub on|prompt=(parted) |color=white}}

With {{Package|sys-apps/gptfdisk}}'s {{c|cgdisk}} utility, this is accomplished by setting the partition type to <code>0xEF02</code> and give it a label of <code>gptbios</code>.

An EFI System Partition is not required, but it would be sensible to make sure that the BIOS boot partition is large enough to be converted to one, should the system motherboard later be upgraded to an EFI board.

The following is the output of pressing the {{Key|p}} key using the {{c|gdisk}} utility on a GPT partitioned disk with both a BIOS boot [0xEF02] partition and an EFI [0xEF00] partition:

{{RootCmd|gdisk /dev/sdc|output=<pre>

</pre>}}

{{Note|The <code>0x</code> hexadecimal prefix does not need to be entered for GPT when using {{c|fdisk}}.}}

Using the same setup, the {{c|parted}} utility gives an output with slightly different syntax:

{{RootCmd|parted /dev/sdc|output=<pre>

(parted)
</pre>}}

Creating partitions in {{c|gdisk}} is straight forward for users already familiar with the {{c|fdisk}} partitioning utility. After starting {{c|gdisk}}, type {{Key|n}} (for new) in the main menu, provide beginning and end sectors (if needed), then set the partition type <code>EF00</code> for an EFI system partition.

Users who have followed the [[Handbook:Main_Page|Gentoo installation instructions]] will already have the proper partitioning layout set up.

=== UEFI with GPT ===

Make sure that the {{Path|/boot}} location is available - if this uses a separate partition, make sure that it is mounted:

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}

Run the {{c|grub2-install}} command to copy the relevant files to {{Path|/boot/grub}}. This should install Grub2 in {{Path|/boot/grub}}, copy the core image to {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/gentoo/grubx64.efi}}, and call [[Efibootmgr|efibootmgr]] to add a boot entry.

{{RootCmd|grub2-install --efi-directory{{=}}/boot/efi|output=<pre>
Installation finished. No error reported.
</pre>}}

The above command assumes the vfat EFI System Partition (ESP) is mounted at {{Path|/boot/efi}}.  If the ESP is mounted directly at {{Path|/boot}}, use <code>--efi-directory=/boot</code>. 

{{c|grub2-install}} also accepts a <code>--target</code> option to set the CPU architecture and system platform. If unspecified, {{c|grub2-install}} will attempt to guess the proper values; on an AMD64 EFI-booted system it will use <code>x86_64-efi</code> by default. {{c|grub2-install}} also accepts a <code>--boot-directory</code> option to tell the GRUB2 installer which directory to look for GRUB2's boot files. This defaults to {{Path|/boot}} but is useful when trying to move a root partition.

==== UEFI용 GPT 분할  ====

For UEFI GPT boot using GRUB2, the system ''must'' have a dedicated EFI partition containing a FAT filesystem.

The EFI partition can ''replace'' having a {{Path|/boot}} partition on {{Path|/dev/sda1}} by having a {{Path|/boot/efi}} partition on {{Path|/dev/sda1}}. This is to say a successful EFI boot scenario using GRUB2 ''can'' operate with two partitions total (three total if a swap partition is needed): a root partition and an EFI partition. Using this configuration, the {{Path|/boot}} ''folder'' will be located in the root {{Path|/}} ''partition'' (at {{Path|/boot}}) and the EFI ''partition'' will mount ''in'' the boot ''folder'' (at {{Path|/boot/efi}}). For further clarification, see the example {{Path|/etc/fstab}} file below.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|title=Example of an UEFI capable 스왑 파티션이 있는 {{Path|/etc/fstab}} 파일에 UEFI 기능 설정 예제|<pre>
/dev/sda1		/boot/efi	vfat		noauto,noatime	1 2
/dev/sda2		none		swap		sw		0 0
/dev/sda3		/		ext4		noatime		0 1
</pre>}}

Generating a 100MB partition for {{Path|/boot/efi}} should provide plenty of space for holding multiple {{Path|*.efi}} files (multiple entries will most likely not be needed; most systems will only use one).

Create the partition using the partitioning [[Partition#GUID_Partition_Table|tool of choice]]. The {{c|gdisk}} ({{Package|sys-apps/gptfdisk}}) and {{c|parted}} ({{Package|sys-block/parted}}) tools fit nicely for this purpose. When using the {{c|gdisk}} utility, be sure to use type <code>EF00</code>.

Proceed to create a FAT filesystem on the EFI system partition using {{c|mkdosfs}} and add it to {{Path|/etc/fstab}} by following the example below:

{{RootCmd|mkdosfs -F 32 -n efi-boot /dev/sda1
|mkdir /boot/efi}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|title=/boot/efi 마운트 항목 추가|<pre>
/dev/sda1		/boot/efi	vfat		noauto,noatime	1 2
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|mount /boot/efi}}

{{Note|It is helpful to set the <var>GRUB_PLATFORMS</var> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. This will assist GRUB2 in determining what options to use when detecting the proper EFI target. For 32-bit EFI systems use <code>efi-32</code>. For 64-bit use <code>efi-64</code>.}}

{{Important|In order for GRUB2 to install properly, the EFI directory ''must'' be mounted ''and'' the <code>efivars</code> kernel module must be loaded before the {{c|grub2-install}} command will complete successfully.}}

==== 대안: 기본 UEFI 펌웨어 위치 사용 ====

If the system's UEFI firmware fails to find GRUB2's EFI bootloader file, using the default boot loader location should provide a working solution. This circumvents the boot menu managed by [[Efibootmgr|efibootmgr]] and thus offers reduced functionality, but is less error prone. To do this, verify the EFI partition is mounted at {{Path|/boot/efi}} then copy the file {{Path|grubx64.efi}} located at {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/gentoo/grubx64.efi}} to {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI}}. This example assumes a 64-bit EFI system, adjust accordingly for 32-bit EFI systems.

== 외부 기능 ==

GRUB2 has many features that make it a very powerful boot loader. It supports:

* Booting from UEFI platforms.
* Booting from GPT partitioned drives without needing a hybrid MBR (hybrid MBR can enabled as needed for compatibility or portability).
* Booting from a [[btrfs]] formatted {{Path|/boot}} partition.
* Booting directly from a [[btrfs]] raid set without needing an [[initramfs]] for early mount setup.
* Booting directly from logical volume management (such as [[LVM|LVM2]]).
* Booting with support for DM-RAID (RAID 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10).
* Booting from encrypted devices (LUKS).

Some specific features are explained in more detail next.

=== 체인 로딩 ===

GRUB2 was built with a truly improved chainload mode when compared to GRUB Legacy. To chainload another boot loader, use the <code>chainloader</code> option.

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/grub/grub.cfg|title=다른 부트로더 체인 로딩|<pre>
menuentry "Custom Super Bootloader Example" {
     insmod part_msdos
     insmod chain
     chainloader (hd1,1)+1
}
</pre>}}

For more information on chainloading, please see the [[GRUB2/Chainloading|Chainloading]] sub-page.

=== 프레임버퍼 화면 사용 ===

To have GRUB2 use a [[framebuffer]] graphical display, re-emerge GRUB with the <code>truetype</code> USE flag enabled. This will install a default True Type font as well as a font conversion utility.

{{Emerge|--newuse sys-boot/grub:2}}

Proceed to configure the default GRUB2 configuration file located at {{Path|/etc/default/grub}}. For example:

Most of the issues can be resolved by ensuring that the partition layout is correct. Make sure enough space is available before the first partition of the disk, or optionally make sure that a ''BIOS boot partition'' is available. Also verify that {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} was correctly generated with {{c|grub2-mkconfig}}, or generate one with a custom menu entry.
