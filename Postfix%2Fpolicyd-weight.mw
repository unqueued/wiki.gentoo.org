'''policyd-weight''' is a weighted rejection-policy daemon for Postfix. Its website is at [http://www.policyd-weight.org/ www.policyd-weight.org]. The Gentoo package is {{Package|mail-filter/policyd-weight}}.

Compared to standard email server configurations, it intercepts mail before it hits the MTA for queuing, is capable of querying RBLs and verifying sender IP addresses versus SMTP <code>HELO/EHLO</code>-claimed identities versus <code>MAIL FROM</code> (sender) addresses and generating a weighted email HAM vs. SPAM (ie. legitimacy) score. You can set a threshold value beneath which mail is rejected, thereby saving CPU time and resources. You can see a [http://www.policyd-weight.org/scheme.html diagram of the approach at the policyd-weight website].
