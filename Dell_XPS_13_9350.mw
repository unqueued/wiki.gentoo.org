This article is currently a WIP. Please add to it.

As Dell makes several differently configured laptops under the same model name, this article is based upon the P54G version. (you can look up yours under the hatch, after "Reg Model".

We're trying to make [[iwlwifi]] work, for more information go to the specific [[iwlwifi]] article.
After enabling the basic 802.11 support kernel options, let's enable the driver !

{Important|In case the driver is built into the kernel (<code>&lt;*&gt;</code>) instead as a module (<code>&lt;M&gt;</code>), also the firmware needs to be built [[Kernel_Modules#Compile-in-kernel_modules_vs_Loadable_kernel_modules_.28LKMs.29|into the kernel]]. See the section [[#When using built-in configuration|When using built-in configuration]].}

==Firmware==
Firmware for the 8260 chip is needed. It is available in {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}:
{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}

=== When using built-in configuration ===

In case the driver is built into the kernel (<code><*></code>) instead as a module (<code><M></code>), also the firmware needs to be built [[Kernel_Modules#Compile-in-kernel_modules_vs_Loadable_kernel_modules_.28LKMs.29|into the kernel]].

==Firmware==
We need firmware for this Skylake chip, for runtime power management, if it wasn't installed before, install {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}:
{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}
This time we'll include the firmware in the kernel.
