This page documents a tutorial for setting up complicated networking with the help of stacked runlevel. Along the tutorial other tricked for OpenRC are also expected.

The short version is that

{{File|rc-update manpage|stack runlevel|<pre>
If the -s, --stack option is given then we either add or remove the runlevel from the runlevel. 
This allows inheritance of run‚Äêlevels.
</pre>}}

We have a university library which provides wireless network, with the following steps:
# associate with the AP with no authentication
# setup a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pptp PPTP] VPN through NAT against an internal server
# using an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http_proxy HTTP proxy] to access the websites

There are big advantages:
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_Routing_Encapsulation GRE] protocol used by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pptp PPTP] uses source ip to identify client, thus do not support tunneling through NAT. There is enhanced GRE for such perpose, but routers has different implementations and only considered PPTP clients for Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X, not for Linux[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.misc.pptpclient.devel/2934].
