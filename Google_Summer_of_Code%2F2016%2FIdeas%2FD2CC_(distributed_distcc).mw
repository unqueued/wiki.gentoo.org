{{GSoCIdea|D2CC (distributed distcc)|year=2016|
<!-- Description goes here: -->
[https://bitbucket.org/mgorny/d2cc D2CC] was started as an attempt to fix shortcomings of distcc (and icecc). However, the author has quickly ran out of time and is unable to continue the work on it. This idea either implies continuing the project or starting from scratch.

The goal behind d2cc is to provide joblimit- & network-sandbox-friendly, dynamically scaling, zero-configuration distributed compilation solution for small local networks running multiple Gentoo hosts. The setup being as simple as starting the daemon on each host, and multicast being used to dynamically find other hosts.
