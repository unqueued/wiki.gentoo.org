This page is about the multi-format package manager [http://paludis.exherbo.org/index.html Paludis].

__TOC__

== Installation == 

Refer to [[Paludis/Guide|the Paludis guide]] for instructions on how to install Paludis and set up the basic configuration.

== Configuration ==

This section gives an overview on where to configure various things in Paludis.

* [http://paludis.exherbo.org/configuration/bashrc.html Toolchain and environmental package behavior]: {{Path|/etc/paludis/bashrc}}
* [http://paludis.exherbo.org/configuration/keywords.html Keywords] (allowing packages from unstable branch): {{Path|/etc/paludis/keywords.conf}} or {{Path|/etc/paludis/keywords.conf.d/*.conf}}
* [http://paludis.exherbo.org/configuration/use.html USE flags] (enabling package features): {{Path|/etc/paludis/use.conf}} or {{Path|/etc/paludis/use.conf.d/*.conf}}
* [http://paludis.exherbo.org/configuration/licenses.html Licenses]: {{Path|/etc/paludis/licenses.conf}} or {{Path|/etc/paludis/licenses.conf.d/*.conf}}
* [http://paludis.exherbo.org/configuration/packagemask.html Package (un)masks]: {{Path|/etc/paludis/package_mask.conf}} or {{Path|/etc/paludis/package_mask.conf.d/*.conf}} and {{Path|/etc/paludis/package_unmask.conf}} or {{Path|/etc/paludis/package_unmask.conf.d/*.conf}} respectively

== Usage ==

This section tries to give a concise usage overview and may serve as a quick lookup reference.
However, it does not and will not replace the [http://paludis.exherbo.org official documentation].

=== Basics and installing a package ===

The most basic form is:

{{RootCmd|cave resolve <category>/<package-name>}}

This will try to solve the dependencies and print out the results. It will '''not''' actually perform the resolution (as in: install the target package). To actually carry out the resolution we would have to pass the <code>-x</code> option. You should only do that if you know what you are doing, because paludis is truly non-interactive and will not ask in between. The more common workflow is to save the resolution information in a so called resume file, review the changes that would be performed (like installing and uninstalling packages) and then execute them:

{{RootCmd
|cave resolve --resume-file ~/cave_resume <category>/<package-name>
|# review resolution on stdout
|cave resume --resume-file ~/cave_resume
}}

It may make sense to create aliases for these commands in your favorite shell.

To perform dependency resolution and instantly carry out the results (if possible), you would do:

{{RootCmd|cave resolve -x <category>/<package-name>}}

It is also possible to pass both <code>-x</code> and <code>--resume-file</code>.

The resume state also allows us to resume compilations/installations we have aborted or which have failed.

Not only the {{c|resolve}} subcommand behaves this way. Refer to the man page of a particular subcommand to get more detailed
information.

All further commands in this section will omit the <code>-x</code> and the <code>--resume-file</code> options (if applicable) and will leave it up to the user which one to choose (or none).

{{Note|You can omit the <code>category/</code> part, in which case Paludis will try to look it up.}}

=== Uninstall a package ===

Either this way:

{{RootCmd|cave uninstall <category>/<package-name>}}

or the following way, which lets you combine it with installation of packages: 

{{RootCmd|cave resolve \!<category>/<package-name>}}

If you want to uninstall all unneeded packages, do

{{RootCmd|cave purge}}

=== Update world ===

{{RootCmd|cave resolve -c world}}

=== Install a repository ===

If you have configured unavailable layman repositories as per the [[Paludis/Guide#Repositories|the Paludis guide]], then you should be able to install repositories just like regular packages.

{{RootCmd|cave resolve <repository-name>}}

If the repository name could be ambiguous with a package name, then you can tell cave explicitly that this is a repository:

{{RootCmd|cave resolve repository/<repository-name>}}

=== Sync all repositories ===

{{RootCmd|cave sync}}

=== Post-Configure a package ===

Some ebuilds have a [https://dev.gentoo.org/~ulm/pms/head/pms.html#x1-1080009.1.14 pkg_config phase] which allows post-install configuration for packages.

A lot of ebuilds might output something like this:

<pre>
 * In order to update your hddtemp database, run:
 * emerge --config =app-admin/hddtemp-0.3_beta15-r7
</pre>

Since we don't use portage, we have to do this instead for the above case:

{{RootCmd|cave config {{=}}app-admin/hddtemp-0.3_beta15-r7}}

=== Tell the resolver how much work it should perform ===

There are 3 main switches that change the default behavior:

* <code>-z, --lazy</code>: Does as little work as possible, typically used when quickly installing a single package only
* <code>-c , --complete</code>: Does all optional work, typically used when updating 'world'
* <code>-e , --everything</code>: Does all optional work and always reinstalls, typically used when you want to rebuild everything after a major gcc upgrade for example

If you don't pass any of those switches, then the default behavior is roughly in between {{c|--lazy}} and {{c|--complete}}. These switches are in fact just shorthands for more fine-grained options. Check the manpage of {{c|cave-resolve}}.

=== Keep output logs ===

Add the following file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/paludis/output.conf|1=
always_keep_output_logs = true
}}

=== Make Paludis quiet ===

Add the following file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/paludis/output.conf|1=
quiet = true
}}

=== Speed up cave-search ===

{{c|cave search}} can make use of a search index, similar to what {{c|eix}} does. First, we have to generate the index:
{{RootCmd|cave manage-search-index --create ~/cave-search-index}}

And then we can use it:
{{RootCmd|cave search --index ~/cave-search-index <pattern>}}
