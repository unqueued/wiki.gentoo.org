== Structure ==

=== Domains ===

The named_t domain can only be transitioned towards through the initrc_t domain (i.e. through init scripts). The ndc_t domain (for the named domain controller) can be transitioned towards through the initrc_t and sysadm_t (general system administration) domains. 

=== File types/labels ===

The following table lists the file type/labels defined in the bind module.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type !! Function !! Description
|-
| named_exec_t || Entrypoint || Entrypoint domain for the named binaries
|-
| named_initrc_exec_t || Entrypoint || Entrypoint domain for non-Gentoo init scripts
|- 
| named_checkconf_exec_t || Entrypoint || Entrypoint for the checkconf binary
|-
| ndc_exec_t || Entrypoint || Entrypoint for the ndc binaries
|-
| dnssec_t || Configuration || Label for the key files used by the named daemon
|-
| named_zone_t || Configuration || Label for the primary zone files
|- 
| named_cache_t || Configuration || Label for the cached zone files
|-
| named_conf_t || Configuration || Label for the named configuration files
|- 
| named_log_t || Configuration || Label for the named log files
|-
| named_tmp_t || || Label for the named temporary files
|-
| named_var_run_t || || Label for the named runtime variable data

== Using the bind SELinux module ==

=== SELinux boolean: named_write_master_zones ===

The named policy offers one boolean called named_write_master_zones which, when enabled, allows the named daemon to write to its master zone files (i.e. named_zone_t). This is used in master/slave setups.
