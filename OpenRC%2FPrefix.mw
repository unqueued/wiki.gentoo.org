This work is a reponse to {{Bug|196294}}.

The following guideline applies to a Gentoo [[Prefix]] on RHEL-5.6 amd64 and on Debian 6.0 amd64, for other setups it should be similar. Feel free to documents corner cases here.

== Getting openrc on Prefix ==

{{Emerge|sys-apps/openrc}}

Specify the system to be Prefix:

{{FileBox|filename=EPREFIX/etc/rc.conf|1=
rc_sys="prefix"
}}

== Tips ==
=== Start OpenRC Automatically ===
As a service manager, OpenRC is more useful to be started automatically.
==== /etc/rc.local ====
Many distributions provide /etc/rc.local as a site specific place start services.

If you have root access to the host, start OpenRC from /etc/rc.local:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/rc.local|1=
EPREFIX/sbin/openrc # replace EPREFIX with yours}}
==== crontab ====
If your do not have root access to the host, but the host has cron, you can hook OpenRC into crontab on every reboot.
{{FileBox|filename=crontab -e|1=
@reboot EPREFIX/sbin/openrc # replace EPREFIX with yours}}
==== .profile ====
If the host does not even have cron, OpenRC can be started from login shell.  Taking bash for example,
{{FileBox|filename=${HOME}/.profile|1=
EPREFIX/sbin/openrc # replace EPREFIX with yours}}

OpenRC does nothing if a runlevel is entered again.  Logging in (and entering default runlevel) many times does not have side-effects.

== Trouble Shooting ==
=== XXX is already starting ===
{{Cmd|rc-service ntpd start|output=<pre>
 * WARNING: ntpd is already starting</pre>}}

OpenRC needs to enter some runlevel to initiate the runtime status directores in EPREFIX/var/run/openrc to really start anything.

{{Cmd|openrc}}

== Example: tinc ==
[http://www.tinc-vpn.org tinc] is a decentralized VPN. A tinc started from Gentoo Prefix can serve as a relay node in the VPN, if tun/tap is not available for normal user.

emerge tinc, or re-emerge to get its {init,conf}.d files back with our new portage
{{Emerge|tinc}}

=== prefixify init script ===
{{Cmd|EPREFIX{{=}}$(portageq envvar EPREFIX)|sed -i -r -e "s,(\W)/(etc{{!}}bin{{!}}sbin{{!}}usr{{!}}var),\1${EPREFIX}/\2,g" ${EPREFIX}/etc/init.d/tincd}}

=== fire up tincd from OpenRC ===
Make necessary changes in ${EPREFIX}/etc/conf.d/tinc.networks and ${EPREFIX}/etc/tinc according to your specific setup.

Add tincd into default runlevel
{{Cmd|rc-update add tincd default}}

Finally we are done with
{{Cmd|openrc|output=<pre>
 * Starting tinc VPN networks ...
 * Starting tinc network manifold ... [ ok ]
 * Starting local                     [ ok ]
</pre>}}

== Example: nginx ==
[[nginx]] is a small, robust and high-performance web server.

Emerge nginx, or re-emerge to get its initd and confd files back with our new portage:
{{Emerge|nginx}}

=== prefixify init script ===
{{Cmd|EPREFIX{{=}}$(portageq envvar EPREFIX)|sed -i -r -e "s,(\W)/(etc{{!}}bin{{!}}sbin{{!}}usr{{!}}var),\1${EPREFIX}/\2,g" ${EPREFIX}/etc/init.d/nginx}}

=== prefixify nginx.conf ===
{{Cmd|EPREFIX{{=}}$(portageq envvar EPREFIX)|sed -i -r -e "s,(\W)/(etc{{!}}bin{{!}}sbin{{!}}usr{{!}}var),\1${EPREFIX}/\2,g" ${EPREFIX}/etc/nginx/nginx.conf}}

=== normal privilege ===
* remove "user nginx nginx;" from the first line of ${EPREFIX}/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
* You cannot listen on port 80 without root privilege. Change it to 8008,

{{FileBox|filename=${EPREFIX}/etc/nginx/nginx.conf|title=listen on 8008|1=
...
http {
    ...
    server {
        ...
        listen [::]:8008;
        ...
    }
    ...
}
}}

=== add nginx to default runlevel and fire up ===
{{Cmd|rc-update add nginx default}}
{{Cmd|openrc|output=<pre>
 * Checking nginx' configuration ... [ ok ]
 * Starting nginx ...                [ ok ]
</pre>}}
{{Cmd|netstat -nlp {{!}} grep  nginx|output=<pre>
(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
tcp6       0      0 :::8008                 :::*                    LISTEN      570/nginx: master p
</pre>}}
