The {{Path|/etc/portage/make.profile/}} or {{Path|/etc/make.profile/}} directories are usually symlinked to the correct profile in {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/}}. Since it is part of Portage it may easily be updated or regenerated by running <tt>emerge --sync</tt>. It defines what a profile is (usually arch specific stuff).

Users who wish to have custom profile should make their own {{Path|make.profile}} directory and populate it by hand. However, when wishing to override some settings, use {{Path|/etc/portage/profile/}} (it supports all of the same file types that {{Path|make.profile}} does, except parent). Do '''''not''''' edit the settings in {{Path|make.profile}} because they '''''will''''' be lost with the next <tt>emerge --sync</tt>. If both {{Path|/etc/portage/make.profile/}} and {{Path|/etc/make.profile/}} exist, then {{Path|/etc/portage/make.profile/}} will be preferred.

Any file in this directory, directories of other profiles or top-level "profiles" directory that begins with {{Path|package.}} or {{Path|use.}} can be more than just a flat file. If it is a directory, then all the files in that directory will be sorted in ascending alphabetical order by file name and summed together as if it were a single file.

{{Note|This behavior is only supported since portage-2.1.6.7, and it is not included in the PMS at this time.}}

* {{Path|${repository_location}/profiles/package.mask/removals}}
* {{Path|${repository_location}/profiles/package.mask/testing}}
