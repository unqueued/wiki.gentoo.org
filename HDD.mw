This article describes the setup of an internal SATA or PATA (IDE) rotational hard disk drive.

== Installation ==

=== Hardware detection ===

To choose the right driver, first detect the used storage controller. {{c|[[Hardware detection|lspci]]}} can be used for this task:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep --color -E "IDE{{!}}SATA"}}

(At runtime) show identification and feature info:

{{RootCmd|hdparm -I /dev/sdX}}

For more detailed information see the [[hdparm]] article.

=== BIOS ===

For AHCI SATA controllers, check the system's [[BIOS]] or firmware to see if if AHCI has been activated.

=== Kernel ===

{{Note|If the root partition is on this drive, the file system drivers have to be build into the kernel.}}

Activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|1=
Device Drivers --->
   <*> Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers  --->
      [*] ATA ACPI Support

   If the drive is connected to a SATA Port Multiplier:
      [*] SATA Port Multiplier support

   Select the driver for the SATA controller, e.g.:
      <*> AHCI SATA support (ahci)

   If the drive is connected to an IDE controller:
      [*] ATA SFF support
      [*] ATA BMDMA support

   Select the driver for the IDE controller, e.g.:
   <*> Intel ESB, ICH, PIIX3, PIIX4 PATA/SATA support (ata_piix)

   SCSI device support  ---> 
      <*> SCSI device support
      <*> SCSI disk support
}}

== Configuration ==

Generally when configuring a hard disk drive one or more [[partition]] will need to be created and [[filesystem]] written into them.

== Usage ==

Filesystems can be mounted in several ways, notable methods include:

* The {{c|[[mount]]}} command.
* {{Path|[[fstab|/etc/fstab]]}} file - Automatic mount at boot time (does not support on demand mount).
* [[removable media]] - Automated mount on demand.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automated mount on demand.

== Troubleshooting ==

See [http://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Libata_error_messages libata wiki].
