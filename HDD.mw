This article describes the setup of an internal SATA or PATA (IDE) hard disk drive.

== Installation ==

=== Hardware detection ===
To choose the right driver, first detect the used storage controller. You can use [[Hardware detection#lspci|lspci]] for this task:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} egrep --color "IDE{{!}}SATA"}}

=== BIOS ===
If you have an AHCI SATA controller, check your [[BIOS]], if AHCI is activated.

=== Kernel ===
{{Note|If your root partition is on this drive, your drivers have to be build into the kernel.}}

You need to activate the following kernel options:
=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers --->
    <*> Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers  --->
        [*]   ATA ACPI Support

        If your drive is connected to a SATA Port Mulitplier:
        [*]   SATA Port Multiplier support

        Select the driver for your SATA controller, e.g.:
        <*>   AHCI SATA support (ahci)

        If your drive is connected to an IDE controller:
        [*]   ATA SFF support
        [*]     ATA BMDMA support

        Select the driver for your IDE controller, e.g.:
        <*>       Intel ESB, ICH, PIIX3, PIIX4 PATA/SATA support (ata_piix)

    SCSI device support  ---> 
        <*> SCSI device support
        <*> SCSI disk support
</pre>}}

== Configuration ==
You need to create [[partition]]s and install a [[filesystem]], if not already existing.

== Advanced Configuration ==
* [[hdparm]] - change hard drive performance parameters
* [[Power Management/HDD|Power Management]]
* [[smartmontools]] - S.M.A.R.T. monitoring tools

== Usage ==
You can mount the filesystems in several ways:
* Single [[mount]].
* [[fstab]] - Automatic mount at boot time.
* [[removable media]] - mount at demand.
* [[autofs]] - Automatic mount at demand.

== Troubleshooting ==
