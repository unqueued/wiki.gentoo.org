'''XMonad''' is a fast and lightweight tiling-windowmanager for X11 written, configured and extended in the purely-functional programming language Haskell.

== Installation ==
Generally, there are two ways to install XMonad:
# You can either install it through emerge by typing <code>emerge --ask xmonad</code>,
# or you install it with cabal: <code>cabal install xmonad</code>.
Afterwards, if you don't use an display-manager and instead want to start X manually using <code>startx</code>, you can add following to your <code>~/.xinitrc</code>:
* <code>xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr</code> will set the usual cursor pointer,
* <code>setxkbmap -layout de</code> will activate the german keyboard-layout
* <code>exec xmonad</code> will launch xmonad.
