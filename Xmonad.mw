'''xmonad''' is [[Article description::a fast and lightweight tiling [[window manager]] for [[X11]]]] written, configured and extended in the purely-functional programming language [[Haskell]].

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-wm/xmonad}}

There are two ways to install XMonad. The Gentoo recommended method is to use Portage so that the package will be integrated into the system's package database.

=== Emerge ===

Merge the {{Package|x11-wm/xmonad}} package:

{{Emerge|x11-wm/xmonad}}

=== Cabal (unsupported) ===

It is possible to install using [[Haskell#Cabal|cabal]], although it is not the Gentoo recommended method for installation system-wide packages. When choosing this route proceed with caution (Portage will not track xmonad)!

{{Cmd|cabal install xmonad}}

== Configuration ==

=== Starting ===

Start xmonad using a [[display manager]] or the {{c|startx}} command.

If want to use startx and want [[ConsoleKit]] support, setup ConsoleKit and create the following file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session xmonad
}}

=== ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs ===

XMonad itself can be configured through {{Path|~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs}} which is written in Haskell.

Minimal configuration file with default configuration:

{{CodeBox|title=Primitive xmonad.hs|lang=haskell|1=
import XMonad

main = xmonad $ defaultConfig
}}

Once you changed your config file you should compile it and restart XMonad.

{{Cmd
|xmonad --recompile
|xmonad --restart
}}

In most cases to write a config file you need additional features provided by the xmonad-contrib library. You can install it from {{Package|x11-wm/xmonad-contrib}}

{{Emerge|xmonad-contrib}}

OR using [[Haskell#Cabal|cabal]]:

{{Cmd|cabal install xmonad-contrib}}

=== Adding status bars ===

Unlike many other window managers, XMonad does not have any built-in status bars. Instead of this it can pipe required information to an external program. Usually, xmobar, or dzen is a good choice for a status bar.

==== xmobar ====

Install {{Package|x11-misc/xmobar}}:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/xmobar}}

==== dzen ====

Install {{Package|x11-misc/dzen}}:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/dzen}}
