'''xmonad''' is a fast and lightweight tiling-windowmanager for X11 written, configured and extended in the purely-functional programming language [[Haskell]].

== Installation ==
Generally, there are two ways to install XMonad:
* Install {{Package|x11-wm/xmonad}}
{{Emerge|xmonad}}
OR 
* Install it with [[Haskell#Cabal|cabal]]:
{{Cmd|cabal install xmonad}}

== Configuration ==

=== ~/.xinitrc ===
If you don't use a [[display manager]] (such as GDM or KDM) and instead want to start the X server using '''startx''', you have to create and edit your {{Path|~/.xinitrc}}. This is just a simple example file:
{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>
hsetroot                       # can be used to set a background-image
xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr # sets the usual cursor pointer
setxkbmap -layout de           # activates the german keyboard-layout
exec xmonad                    # launches xmonad
</pre>}}

=== ConsoleKit integration ===
If you want to make use of automounting, manage power or network devices you'll probably want to make use of [[ConsoleKit]] and [[polkit]]. This forces you to start XMonad in a slightly different way:
{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>
...
exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session xmonad
</pre>}}

and remove the ''noX11'' option of the ''pam_ck_connector.so'' line:
{{File|/etc/pam.d/system-login||<pre>
session		optional	pam_ck_connector.so
</pre>}}

=== ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs ===
XMonad itself can be configured through {{Path|~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs}} which is written in Haskell.
