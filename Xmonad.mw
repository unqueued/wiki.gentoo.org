'''XMonad''' is a fast and lightweight tiling-windowmanager for X11 written, configured and extended in the purely-functional programming language [[Haskell]].

== Installation ==
Generally, there are two ways to install XMonad:
* Install it through emerge by typing {{Emerge|x11-wm/xmonad}}
OR 
* Install it with [[Haskell#Cabal|cabal]]: {{Cmd|cabal install xmonad}}

== Configuration ==
=== <code>~/.xinitrc</code> ===
If you don't use a display-manager (such as GDM or KDM) and instead want to start Xorg using <code>startx</code>, you have to create and edit your <code>~/.xinitrc</code>. This is just a simple example file:
{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>hsetroot                       # can be used to set a background-image
xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr # sets the usual cursor pointer
setxkbmap -layout de           # activates the german keyboard-layout
exec xmonad                    # launches xmonad
</pre>}}
=== <code>~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs</code> ===
XMonad itself can be configured through <code>~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs</code> which is written in Haskell.
