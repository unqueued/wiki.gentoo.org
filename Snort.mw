== Configuration ==
Gentoo requires snort users to define the interface being monitored the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/snort}} configuration file.

Snort ships with an example config that must be moved and edited:
{{RootCmd|cp /etc/snort/snort.conf.distrib /etc/snort/snort.conf}}

== Troubleshooting ==

1. {{Unable to open address file /etc/snort/white_list.rules or /etc/snort/black_list.rules, Error: No such file or directory}}
Than create empty file in /etc/snort directory.

2. {{FATAL ERROR: /etc/snort/snort.conf(733) Config option "daq" can only be configured once.}}
For that install the package net-libs/libnetfilter_queue and enable this kernel option CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK_QUEUE:

== Boot services ==
==== OpenRC ====
To start <tt>snort</tt> at boot:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add snort default}}

To start <tt>snort</tt> immediately:
{{RootCmd|rc-service snort start}}
