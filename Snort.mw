== Configuration ==
Gentoo requires snort users to define the interface being monitored the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/snort}} configuration file.

Snort ships with an example config that must be moved and edited:
{{RootCmd|cp /etc/snort/snort.conf.distrib /etc/snort/snort.conf}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== white_list.rules and black_list.rules file not found ===

PROBLEM: Unable to open address file /etc/snort/white_list.rules or /etc/snort/black_list.rules, Error: No such file or directory

SOLUTION: create those 2 files in /etc/snort/ or /etc/snort/rules/ directory and change the location appropriately in /etc/snort/snort.conf

=== FATAL ERROR: Can't initialize DAQ afpacket (-1) - ===

PROBLEM: Snort daemon fails to load with the error 'FATAL ERROR: Can't initialize DAQ afpacket (-1) -'

SOLUTION: Install the package net-libs/libnetfilter_queue and enable the kernel option CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK_QUEUE, after that in snort.conf change the option config daq: afpacket too config daq: pcap
