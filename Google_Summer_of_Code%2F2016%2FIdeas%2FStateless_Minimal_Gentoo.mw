|Stateless Minimal Gentoo|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
One good way of distributing software is to avoid the concept of binary packages and release full OS atomic updates remotely. One can create an extremely minimal system consisting of not much more than a kernel and would fetch needed files on-demand.

The idea of this project is to automate the building of minimal stateless Gentoo. This stateless Gentoo could be the base OS for large scale software deployment, but possibly desktop as well. 

Several other Linux systems mainly, CoreOS and CernVM already offer such stateless minimal systems. (source of good inspiration for this project)
