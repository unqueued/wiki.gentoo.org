|Stateless Minimal Gentoo|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
The idea is to automate the building of minimal stateless Gentoo. Such a stateless Gentoo could be the base OS for large scale software deployment, but possibly desktop as well. Several other Linux already offer such stateless minimal systems, as CoreOS or CernVM to get good inspiration from.
