The '''Intel XDK''' is a tool to develop mobile Web apps with a native (iOS, Android, ...) wrapper based on Apache Cordova.
== Install ==

There is no ebuild an the installer will fail with the message "GTK library is not installed or installed version is not compatible"
although it is installed. This is due to the fact that the installer just checks via RPM whether a package named <code>gtk2</code>
is installed.

A manual installation of at least version 0505 is possible as follows:

# Download the 64 bit version of the XDK from the [http://xdk-software.intel.com/downloader.html?other64 XDK Download Page]
# Extract the archive 
# Install only the RPM file {{Path|intel-xdk-0505-2.0-0.x86_64.rpm}} located in {{Path|xdk_web_linux64/rpm/}} as root via <code>rpm -iv --nodeps intel-xdk-0505-2.0-0.x86_64.rpm</code>
# Delete the broken symlink to libudev via <code>rm /opt/intel/XDK/./libudev.so.0</code>
# Create the correct link via <code>ln -s /usr/lib64/libudev.so /opt/intel/XDK/./libudev.so.0</code>

== Using Intel XDK ==

Start the application via <code>/opt/intel/XDK/./xdk.sh</code>
