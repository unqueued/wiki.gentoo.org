==Preparing The Disks==

Prior to installing Gentoo on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, the SD card must be prepared first. We can use either fdisk or Parted to accomplish this. But before we go into that, we must first figure out what the SD card identifies as on your Gentoo system. We can do this using lsblk -
{{RootCmd| lsblk}}

If your SD card still has NOOBS installed on it, the output from lsblk should look something like this -
{{ContentBox|Example lsblk output - NOOBS SD Card|<pre>
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda    8:0      0 74.5G  0 disk
sda1   8:1      0    2M  0 part
sda2   8:2      0  128M  0 part
sda3   8:3      0    4G  0 part [SWAP]
sda4   8:4      0 70.4G  0 part /
sdb    8:16     1 29.7G  0 disk
sdb1   8:17     1  1.5G  0 part
sdb2   8:18     1    1K  0 part
sdb5   8:21     1   32M  0 part
sdb6   8:22     1   66M  0 part
sdb7   8:23     1 28.1G  0 part
</pre>}}

In this example, this Gentoo host system uses /dev/sda as the Gentoo host system block device. /dev/sdb is the NOOBS SD card. We'll use that for our example throughout this article.

If you're using a brand new pre-formatted SD card, the output from lsblk would look like this -

{{ContentBox|Example lsblk output - new/blank pre-formatted SD Card|<pre>
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 74.5G  0 disk
sda1     8:1    0    2M  0 part
sda2     8:2    0  128M  0 part
sda3     8:3    0    4G  0 part [SWAP]
sda4     8:4    0 70.4G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   1 29.7G  0 disk
</pre>}}

For our partition table, our boot partition must be a primary partition and it must be a FAT32 partition for the Raspberry Pi to boot. For the swap and root partitions, we can use standard Linux formats. Optionally, we can create an extended partition and make the swap and root partitions as logical partitions if we wish. For this installation example, all partitions will be primary partitions.

===fdisk===
{{RootCmd| fdisk -w always /dev/sdb}}

The -w always switch will wipe all signatures as we create partitions. Once fdisk starts, pass the 'p' option to see the partitions currently present on the SD card.

{{ContentBox|Start fdisk and print partitions with 'p' command|<pre>

</pre>}}

First we will pass the o command to create a new MS-DOS disk label. This will delete all partitions currently in the table.

{{ContentBox|Create New MS-DOS Label and print partitions with 'p' command|<pre>
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.30).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.


Command (m for help): o

I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x67d2396a

Command (m for help):</pre>}}

As you can see, the o command created our new DOS disklabel and deleted all partitions.

Next, we're going to make the boot partition. First, we'll use the 'n' command to make a new partition. Then, press enter for the following three prompts. This gives you the default options of -

p - Primary Partition<br />Partition number 1<br />First sector at 2048

For the last sector, we'll set it at +128M. This gives us a boot partition size of 128MiB. 

Then, we'll use the 't' command to change the partition type. Select hex code 'c' to change it to a 'W95 FAT32 (LBA)' partition type. Finally, use the 'a' command to toggle on the bootable flag on partition 1.

{{ContentBox|Make the boot partition|<pre>
Command (m for help): n

Command (m for help):</pre>}}

Using the 'P' command, print the partition table to verify that the boot partition has been made correctly -

{{ContentBox|Print partition table with 'p' command|<pre>
Disk /dev/sdb: 29.7 GiB, 31914983424 bytes, 62333952 sectors

/dev/sdb1  *     2048 264191  262144  128M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
</pre>}}

As we can see, we have created a bootable partition starting at sector 2048 that is 128MiB in size and is a FAT32 partition type.

Next, we'll create the swap partition. Pass the 'n' command again to create a new partition. Again, we'll press enter for the next 3 prompts to get the following default options -

p - Primary Partition<br />Partition number 2<br />First sector at sector 264192<br />

Then we will set a swap size of 2GiB by passing +2G for the last sector/size. Finally, once the second partition is created, we'll use the 't' command to change the partition type, and select hex code 82 to change our partition type to 'Linux swap / Solaris'.

{{ContentBox|Create the swap partition|<pre>
Command (m for help): n

   p   primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free)

Created a new partition 2 of type 'Linux' and of size 2 GiB.

Command (m for help): t
Partition number (1,2, default 2): 2
Hex code (type L to list all codes): 82

Changed type of partition 'Linux' to 'Linux swap / Solaris'.

Command (m for help):
</pre>}}

Now print your partition table using the 'p' command and it should look like this -

{{ContentBox|Print the partition table|<pre>
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/sdb: 29.7 GiB, 31914983424 bytes, 62333952 sectors

/dev/sdb2       264192 4458495 4194304    2G 82 Linux swap / Solaris

Command (m for help):
</pre>}}

Now for the root partition. Use the 'n' command for a new partition. Then press Enter 3 more times to go with all default options. This will set us up with a primary partition on partition 3 with the rest of the available space as the root partition.

{{ContentBox|Create the /root partition|<pre>
Command (m for help): n

Created a new partition 3 of type 'Linux' and of size 27.6 GiB.

Command (m for help):
</pre>}}

And finally, print the partition table once more and your table should look like this -
{{ContentBox|Final partition table|<pre>
Command (m for help): p

/dev/sdb3       4458496 62333951 57875456 27.6G 83 Linux

Command (m for help):
</pre>}}

If your partition table looks like the above, pass the 'w' command to write the table to the SD card and exit fdisk.

{{ContentBox|Save table to SD Card and exit fdisk with the 'w' command|<pre>
Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered.

Syncing disks.

root ~ $
</pre>}}

If all is good, skip down to Create Filesystems.

===Create Partitions Using Parted===

Alternatively, we can also use Parted to prepare our SD card. Let's set up for optimal alignment using the -a optimal command line option. Once on the Parted command line, type 'print' to see the current partition layout:
{{RootCmd| GNU Parted 3.2
|Using /dev/sdb
|Welcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.
|(parted) print
}}

On a fresh SanDisk 16GB SD card, the output should look something like this -

{{
|Model: Mass Storage Device (scsi)
|Disk /dev/sdb: 15.9GB
|Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
|Partition Table: msdos
|Disk Flags:

|Number  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags
| 1      4194kB  15.9GB  15.9GB  primary  fat32        lba

|(parted)}}

===Create Filesystems===
Now that our new partition table has been created, it's time to format the partitions with our file systems. We will be formatting the boot partition with FAT32 and the root partition EXT4. Finally, we will also initialize the swap partition.

Create the FAT32 boot filesystem.
{{RootCmd| mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1<br />mkfs.fat 4.1 (2017-01-24)}}

Create the ext4 root filesystem.  If you get the "/dev/sdb3 contains `gzip compressed data, max compression, from Unix' data
Proceed anyway? (y,N)", hit 'y' and press enter.
{{RootCmd| mkfs.ext4 -i 8192 /dev/sdb3<br />mke2fs 1.43.4 (31-Jan-2017)
/dev/sdb3 contains `gzip compressed data, max compression, from Unix' data<br />Proceed anyway? (y,N) y<br />Creating filesystem with 7234432 4k blocks and 3617328 inodes<br />Filesystem UUID: c229e329-f512-4e07-a7d9-b5e1f62f33a7<br />Superblock backups stored on blocks:

        4096000

Allocating group tables: done<br />Writing inode tables: done<br />Creating journal (32768 blocks): done<br />Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
}}

Finally, initialize the swap partition.
{{RootCmd| mkswap /dev/sdb2<br />Setting up swapspace version 1 size{{=}}2 GiB (2147479552 bytes)<br />no label,UUID{{=}}8625c597-3a09-4aa9-aa15-38b0d713d00f}}

===Mount Filesystem===

Now that we have our file systems in place, we want to create a mount point in the host system's /mnt directory. We'll call this mount point /pi3-gentoo.

{{RootCmd| mkdir -v /mnt/pi3-gentoo<br />mkdir: created directory '/mnt/pi3-gentoo'}}

Mount the SD card root partition to our new mount point -
{{RootCmd| mount -v /dev/sdb3 /mnt/pi3-gentoo<br />mount: /dev/sdb3 mounted on /mnt/pi3-gentoo.}}

Change into our new pi3-root directory -
{{RootCmd| cd /mnt/pi3-gentoo}}

===Get Latest Stage 3===

Now we'll fire up the lynx command line browser and go to the Gentoo download mirrors to grab the latest arm64 stage3 tarball -

{{RootCmd| lynx https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/}}

Select the mirror nearest you and browse to releases/arm/autobuilds/current-stage3-arm64. Select stage3-arm64-yyyymmdd.tar.bz2, press 'D', then hit Enter twice to download and save to the pi3-gentoo directory. Once downloaded, exit lynx by pressing 'Q', then press Y.

Now extract the downloaded tarball. At the time of this writing, the current stage3 is stage3-arm64-20161219.tar.bz2 -
{{RootCmd| tar xvjpf stage3-arm64-20161219.tar.bz2 --xattrs --numeric-owner}}

Once extraction completes, /mnt/gentoo/tmp needs to be emptied. Clear it now or the the Pi will do it at boot. That may take a long time. 

{{RootCmd| rm -rfv /mnt/pi3-gentoo/tmp/*}}

===Portage Tree===

Download the latest Portage snapshot -
{{RootCmd| wget http://distfiles.gentoo.org/snapshots/portage-latest.tar.bz2}}

Extract Portage to SD Card -
{{RootCmd| tar xjvpf portage-latest.tar.bz2 -C /mnt/pi3-gentoo/usr}}

====Base System Configuration===

===Copy DNS Info===
Copy the host system's DNS info to the target system -
{{RootCmd| cp -L /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/pi3-gentoo/etc}}

====Configure make.conf====

Configure make.conf as follows -

{{ContentBox|/mnt/pi3-gentoo/etc/portage/make.conf|<pre>
# These settings were set by the catalyst build script that automatically
# built this stage.

====Configure fstab====

Configure /mnt/pi3-gentoo/etc/fstab as follows -

{{ContentBox|/mnt/pi3-gentoo/etc/fstab|<pre>
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# noatime turns off atimes for increased performance (atimes normally aren't

=== Using Crossdev to Build A Cross Compiler ===
{{RootCmd|crossdev -t aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu}}

You may need to nominate an overlay to store the cross ebuilds, crossdev will let you know. 

There are other parameters you can pass to crossdev too. 
{{Important|Do not use -S to build a stable toolchain, arm64 moves quickly}}

{{Important|Crossdev insists that many of the files in /etc/portage/ are directories}}
Convert files as crossdev asks e.g. 
 error: please convert /etc/portage/package.env to a directory
by appending _file to the existing filename
{{RootCmd|mv /etc/portage/package.env /etc/portage/package.env_file}}
making the directory
{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/portage/package.env}}
then moving  package.env_file into the directory.
{{RootCmd|mv /etc/portage/package.env_file /etc/portage/package.env}}

Rinse and repeat until crossdev is happy.

crossdev will take a while. Its building
 binutils:              binutils-[latest]
 gcc:                   gcc-[latest]
 headers:               linux-headers-[latest]
 libc:                  glibc-[latest]

When crossdev completes you will have a cross toolchain

{{Cmd|$ gcc-config -l
 [1] aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-5.4.0 *

 [2] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-5.3.0
 [3] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-5.4.0 *
}}

It will also create an arm64 target root in '''/usr/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/''' This is used by cross emerge. 

Pure cross compiling, other than the kernel, is out of scope of this guide.

== Fetch the Raspberry Pi Firmware ==
The Raspberry Pi Firmware is maintained in a git repository.  You will need to install git if you don't have it.
{{RootCmd|emerge -av git}}

Don't do anything you don't need to do as root. 

As your normal user, make some space in the home directory for raspberry pi
{{cmd|mkdir raspberrypi}} will do nicely. 

This will be for the Raspberry Pi Firmware and kernel

{{Cmd|cd raspberrypi}}
{{cmd|git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware}}

will fetch the Pi firmware into a directory called '''firmware'''

It will actually fetch all the history too.  If you are short of space or bandwidth, a shallow clone is all that's needed.
{{Important|Receiving objects: 100% (484760/484760), 6.32 GiB | 6.34 MiB/s, done}} 
A full clone is 6.3G and growing, we only need the /boot directory out of the master branch.

There is nothing to build.  ~/raspberrypi/firmware/boot is used as is.

== Fetch, Configure and Build the Raspberry Pi Kernel ==

=== Fetch the Raspberry Pi Kernel ===

Stay in raspberrypi and 

{{Cmd|git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux}}

will fetch the kernel into a directory called '''linux'''.

With absolutely no fanfare at all, 64 bit support was added to this kernel tree late in 2016.  No more searching for odd patches.

Not everything has been accepted by the mainline kernel yet but its getting closer.  Feel free to test for yourself.

The master branch may be broken as its commit by commit as it happens.  Test if you want to.  Its better to use an identified tag. At the time of writing that is rpi-4.10.y. The 4.10 mainline kernel is still at -rc status.
{{Cmd|cd linux}}
{{Cmd|git checkout rpi-4.10.y
Checking out files: 100% (33079/33079), done.

Branch rpi-4.10.y set up to track remote branch rpi-4.10.y from origin.

Switched to a new branch 'rpi-4.10.y'
}}

That's the kernel source tree in place, ready for configuring and cross compiling.

=== Configure The Kernel ===

{{Important|ARCH{{=}}arm64 must be specified everywhere or the kernel build system will use the HOST arch. This will destroy the arm64 .config file}}

As your user {{cmd|cd raspberrypi/linux}}

The bcmrpi3_defconfig is almost right as it stands.  It defaults to the powersave CPU governor, which runs the Pi at 600MHz.
All the governors are there. Ondemand is recommended.    
{{Cmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make bcmrpi3_defconfig}}
Either use menuconfig to change the default CPU governor, add something to the kernel command line, or change it after booting.
{{Cmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make menuconfig}}

Search for CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV go to that location and set the default to Ondemand. Exit menuconfig, saving the change.

The kernel .config contains lots of support for hardware you don't have and possibly 
have never heard of. More confident readers may be tempted to trim things out now.  
A word of advice - '''don't''', at least, not until the system boots.

=== Cross Compiling The Kernel ===


The kernel will not link with the gold linker. It ends with
 aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-ld: fatal error: -shared and -pie are incompatible
If you don't know what the gold linker is, you are not using it.

The build is conventional, other than telling the build system to build for arm64 and use the cross compiler.
{{Cmd|ARCH{{=}}arm64 CROSS_COMPILE{{=}}aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu- make -jX}}
Change X to the number of parallel MAKE jobs you want to run.  Convention is cores+1.
