==Preparing The Disks==

Prior to installing Gentoo on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, the SD card must be prepared first. We can use either fdisk or Parted to accomplish this. But before we go into that, we must first figure out what the SD card identifies as on your Gentoo system. We can do this using lsblk -
{{RootCmd| lsblk}}

If your SD card still has NOOBS installed on it, the output from lsblk should look something like this -
{{ContentBox|Example lsblk output - NOOBS SD Card|<pre>
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda    8:0      0 74.5G  0 disk
sda1   8:1      0    2M  0 part
sda2   8:2      0  128M  0 part
sda3   8:3      0    4G  0 part [SWAP]
sda4   8:4      0 70.4G  0 part /
sdb    8:16     1 29.7G  0 disk
sdb1   8:17     1  1.5G  0 part
sdb2   8:18     1    1K  0 part
sdb5   8:21     1   32M  0 part
sdb6   8:22     1   66M  0 part
sdb7   8:23     1 28.1G  0 part
</pre>}}

In this example, this Gentoo system uses /dev/sda as the Gentoo system block device. /dev/sdb is the NOOBS SD card. We'll use that for our example throughout this article.

If you're using a brand new pre-formatted SD card, the output from lsblk would look like this -

{{ContentBox|Example lsblk output - new/blank pre-formatted SD Card|<pre>
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 74.5G  0 disk
tqsda1   8:1    0    2M  0 part
tqsda2   8:2    0  128M  0 part
tqsda3   8:3    0    4G  0 part [SWAP]
mqsda4   8:4    0 70.4G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   1 29.7G  0 disk
</pre>}}

For our partition table, our boot partition must be a primary partition and it must be a FAT32 partition for the Raspberry Pi to boot. For the swap and root partitions, we can use standard Linux formats. Optionally, we can create an extended partition and make the swap and root partitions as logical partitions if we wish. For this installation example, all partitions will be primary partitions.

===fdisk===
{{RootCmd| fdisk -w always /dev/sdb}}

The -w always switch will wipe all signatures as we create partitions. Once fdisk starts, pass the 'p' option to see the partitions currently present on the SD card.

First we will pass the o command to create a new MS-DOS disk label. This will delete all partitions currently in the table.

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.30).

Command (m for help):</pre>}}

As you can see, the o command created our new DOS disklabel and deleted all partitions.

Next, we're going to make the boot partition. First, we'll use the 'n' command to make a new partition. Then, press enter for the following three prompts. This gives you the default options of -

p - Primary Partition
Partition number 1
First sector at 2048

For the last sector, we'll set it at +128M. This gives us a boot partition size of 128MiB. 

Then, we'll use the 't' command to change the partition type. Select hex code 'c' to change it to a 'W95 FAT32 (LBA)' partition type. Finally, use the 'a' command to toggle on the bootable flag on partition 1.

{{ContentBox|Example - Make the boot partition|<pre>
Command (m for help): n
Partition type
   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)
Select (default p):

Using default response p.
Partition number (1-4, default 1):
First sector (2048-62333951, default 2048):
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-62333951, default 62333951): +128M

Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 128 MiB.

Command (m for help): t
Selected partition 1
Hex code (type L to list all codes): c
Changed type of partition 'Linux' to 'W95 FAT32 (LBA)'.

Command (m for help): a
