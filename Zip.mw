'''zip''' [[Article description::provides classic zip compression.]] It is handy for cross-platform compatibility with Microsoft operating systems. Newer versions of zip include support for Unicode and encryption. These can be enabled or disabled at built time on Gentoo systems by their respective [[#USE flags|USE flags]] (see below).

The equal and opposite program to zip is [[unzip]], which is included in a separate package ({{Package|app-arch/unzip}}).

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-arch/zip}}

=== Emerge ===

After adjusting USE flags:

{{Emerge|app-arch/zip}}

Optionally {{c|emerge}} {{Package|app-arch/unzip}} for unzip capabilities (see the [[unzip]] article for more information).

== Removal ==

{{Emerge|params+=--unmerge|app-arch/zip}}

== Configuration ==

=== Environment variables ===

zip does not have any configuration ''files'', however its operation is modifiable by the following environment variables:

* <var>ZIPOPT</var> - Can be used to set any option for the {{c|zip}} command.
* <var>ZIP</var> - Does the exact same thing as the <var>ZIPOPT</var> variable (directly above).
* <var>Zip$Options</var> - For RISC OS use. Does the exact same thing as the <var>ZIPOPT</var> variable (directly above).
* <var>Zip$Exts</var> - For RISC OS use. Contains  extensions separated by a <code>:</code> (colon) that will cause native filenames with one of the specified extensions to be added to the zip file with basename and extension swapped.
* <var>ZIP_OPTS</var> - For VMS use. Does the exact same thing as the <var>ZIPOPT</var> variable.

== Usage ==
ZIP a file
Creates the archive data.zip and puts all the files in the current directory in it in compressed form, type:

Note: No need to add .zip extension or suffix as it is added automatically by zip command.
{{cmd|zip data * }}

To zip up an entire directory (including all subdirectories), type the following command:
{{cmd|zip -r data *}}

It is possible to zip a file and save the zip file in another directory by indicating the new destination path with the name of the zip file at the end.
{{cmd|zip test/zipfolder/file10.zip file10 }}

You can also try -9 option for best compressionÀê
{{cmd|zip -9 -r backupfile mydata}}

Update one file or more files of the compressed archive, suppose we have compressed an archive then, modified a file. There is a possibility to add the update file to the compressed archive with the zip -u command.
{{cmd|zip -u backfile.zip foo boo}}

You can replace (freshen) an existing entry in the zip archive only if it has been modified more recently than the version already in the zip archive. Unlike the update option, this will not add files that are not already in the zip archive.
{{cmd|zip -f foo.zip}}

  -A   adjust self-extracting exe   -J   junk zipfile prefix (unzipsfx)
  -T   test zipfile integrity       -X   eXclude eXtra file attributes
  -y   store symbolic links as the link instead of the referenced file
  -e   encrypt                      -n   don't compress these suffixes

  -O  --output-file  write output to new zip file
  -q  --quiet        quiet operation, suppress some informational messages
  -h  --help         show this help
  -v  --version      show version info
