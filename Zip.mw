'''zip''' provides classic zip compression. It is handy for cross-platform compatibility with Microsoft operating systems. Newer versions of zip include support for Unicode and encryption. These can be enabled or disabled at built time on Gentoo systems by their respective [[#USE flags|USE flags]] (see below).

The equal and opposite program to zip is [[unzip]], which is included in a separate package ({{Package|app-arch/unzip}}).

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-arch/zip}}

=== Emerge ===

After adjusting USE flags:

{{Emerge|app-arch/zip}}

Optionally {{c|emerge}} {{Package|app-arch/unzip}} for unzip capabilities (see the [[unzip]] article for more information).

== Removal ==

{{Emerge|params+=--unmerge|app-arch/zip}}

== Configuration ==

=== Environment variables ===

zip does not have any configuration ''files'', however its operation is modifiable by the following environment variables:

* <var>ZIPOPT</var> - Can be used to set any option for the {{c|zip}} command.
* <var>ZIP</var> - Does the exact same thing as the <var>ZIPOPT</var> variable (directly above).
* <var>Zip$Options</var> - For RISC OS use. Does the exact same thing as the <var>ZIPOPT</var> variable (directly above).
* <var>Zip$Exts</var> - For RISC OS use. Contains  extensions separated by a <code>:</code> (colon) that will cause native filenames with one of the specified extensions to be added to the zip file with basename and extension swapped.
* <var>ZIP_OPTS</var> - For VMS use. Does the exact same thing as the <var>ZIPOPT</var> variable.

  -F   fix zipfile (-FF try harder) -D   do not add directory entries
  -A   adjust self-extracting exe   -J   junk zipfile prefix (unzipsfx)
  -T   test zipfile integrity       -X   eXclude eXtra file attributes
  -y   store symbolic links as the link instead of the referenced file
  -e   encrypt                      -n   don't compress these suffixes
