Gentoo NetBSD (or Gentoo/NBSD, or G/NBSD) was an effort to create a complete [http://netbsd.org/ NetBSD-based] Gentoo system, sharing the complete administration facilities of Gentoo with the reliability of the NetBSD kernel and userland.

It offered a stage3 for Gentoo NetBSD, so installation is possible without the need for a regular NetBSD installation. To install Gentoo NetBSD an [[Gentoo NetBSD/Install Guide|install guide]] was written.

This project is now defunct.
