== Setup ==
Follow the [[CDROM]] page for hardware driver kernel configuration, along with including UDF write support.

Install cdrtools or dvd+rw-tools packages, for writing CD/DVD/BD media.
{{Emerge|cdrtools}}

Or,
{{Emerge|dvd+rw-tools}}

For UDF writing, ensure you've included the above mentioned UDF kernel drivers and the following package,
{{Emerge|udftools}}

Best practice is to use read write (RW/RE) media for testing writing ISO9660/UDF [[filesystem]] images.  If a command fails to work, or the hardware or media fails, you can try again.  Direct file copy operations with CD/DVD/BD media may be slow and still risky sometimes?

== ISO9960/UDF filesystem ==

=== Find Size of Media ===
First, find the maximum size the media can contain.

{{Cmd|dvd+rw-mediainfo /dev/sr0|output=<pre>
Track Size:            24438784*2KB
</pre>}}
(Or 24438784*2KB = 48877568 KB for 50GB BD-R DL media)

{{Cmd|truncate --size{{=}}48877568KB test.udf}}

Or you can use the following with disabling Defect Management,
{{Cmd|truncate --size{{=}}50GB ./test.udf}}

{{Note|Defect Management sets aside 256MB aside during formatting and also reduces write to half speed. See below Writing section for specifics.}}

=== Create and Populate Filesystem ===
Create either a ISO9960 or UDF filesystem. Microsoft Windows uses lvid for optical media title.
{{Cmd|mkudffs --lvid{{=}}"MY_VOLUME" --utf8 ./test.udf}}

Mount the filesystem:
{{Cmd|sudo mount -oloop,rw ./test.udf /mnt/tmp/}}

Populate filesystem:
{{Cmd|rsync -ax --delete /home/roger/Documents/ /mnt/tmp/}}

Verify proper permissions are preserved:
{{Cmd
|chown -R roger.roger /mnt/tmp
|chmod -R a+r /mnt/tmp
|chmod -R go-w /mnt/tmp
}}

== Writing ==

=== Normal File Copying ===

==== CD-RW Media ====
CD-RW media requires the packet device driver and starting the {{Path|/etc/init.d/pktcdvd}} service and the following line within [[fstab]]:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
/dev/pktcdvd/0  /mnt/udfwrite  udf             user,noauto,noatime,utf8  0 0
}}

==== DVD/BD (RW/RE) Media ====
DVD-RW, DVD+RW and BD-RE media can be easily written by simply mounting the media and writing to the media as a normal filesystem, as these devices and media allow random writing, versus CD-RW only allowing sequential writing.

=== Image Writing ===

==== CD Writing ====

===== ISO =====
{{Cmd
|cdrecord -scanbus
|cdrecord -speed{{=}}40 dev{{=}}2,0,0 -eject -dao driveropts{{=}}burnfree test.iso
}}

===== UDF =====
TODO

==== DVD/BD ====

===== BD Defect Management =====
By default growisofs uses Defect Management which requires 256MB extra space and uses reduced write speeds. You may disable this with,
{{Cmd|dvd+rw-format /dev/dvd -ssa{{=}}none}}

And use the following after writing to ensure files are properly written.
{{Cmd|diff -r /home/roger/Documents/ /mnt/tmp/}}

===== ISO =====
{{Cmd|growisofs -Z /dev/sr0{{=}}test.iso}}

===== UDF =====
Atypically, you can write with the following as long as you are within the limits of your DVD/BD media's size limitations.
{{Cmd|growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/sr0{{=}}test.udf}}

If you have used the above truncate with 25GB/50GB, specifying the top limits of BD media, you will need to disable Defect Management requiring 256MB extra space.
{{Cmd|growisofs -use-the-force-luke{{=}}spare:none -dvd-compat -speed{{=}}4 -Z /dev/sr0{{=}}test.udf}}
