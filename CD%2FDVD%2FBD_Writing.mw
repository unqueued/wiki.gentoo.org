== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Follow the [[CDROM]] page for hardware driver kernel configuration, along with including UDF write support.

Install the cdrtools or dvd+rw-tools packages, for writing CD/DVD/BD media:

{{Emerge|app-cdr/cdrtools}}

Or:

{{Emerge|app-cdr/dvd+rw-tools}}

For UDF writing, ensure included the above mentioned UDF kernel drivers and the following package:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/udftools}}

Best practice is to use read write (RW/RE) media for testing writing ISO9660/UDF [[filesystem]] images.  If a command fails to work, or the hardware or media fails, you can try again.  Direct file copy operations with CD/DVD/BD media may be slow and still risky sometimes?

== Usage ==

Usage for the ISO9960/UDF filesystem.

=== Determine the size of media ===

First, find the maximum size the media can contain.

{{Cmd|dvd+rw-mediainfo /dev/sr0|output=<pre>
Track Size:            24438784*2KB
</pre>}}

(Or 24438784*2KB = 48877568 KB for 50GB BD-R DL media)

{{Cmd|truncate --size{{=}}48877568KB test.udf}}

Or you can use the following with disabling defect management:

{{Cmd|truncate --size{{=}}50GB ./test.udf}}

{{Note|Defect management sets aside 256MB aside during formatting and also reduces write to half-speed. See the writing section below for specifics.}}

=== Create and populate filesystem ===

Create either a ISO9960 or UDF filesystem. Microsoft Windows uses lvid for optical media title:

{{Cmd|mkudffs --lvid{{=}}"MY_VOLUME" --utf8 ./test.udf}}

Mount the filesystem:

{{Cmd|sudo mount -oloop,rw ./test.udf /mnt/tmp/}}

Populate filesystem:

{{Cmd|rsync -ax --delete /home/roger/Documents/ /mnt/tmp/}}

Verify proper permissions are preserved:

{{Cmd
|chown -R roger.roger /mnt/tmp
|chmod -R a+r /mnt/tmp
|chmod -R go-w /mnt/tmp
}}

=== Writing ===

==== CD-RW media ====

CD-RW media requires the packet device driver and starting the {{Path|/etc/init.d/pktcdvd}} service and the following line within [[fstab]]:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
/dev/pktcdvd/0  /mnt/udfwrite  udf             user,noauto,noatime,utf8  0 0
}}

==== DVD/BD (RW/RE) media ====

DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and BD-RE media can be easily written by simply mounting the media and writing to the media as a normal filesystem, as these devices and media allow random writing, versus CD-RW only allowing sequential writing.

=== Image writing ===

==== CD writing ====

===== ISO =====

{{Cmd
|cdrecord -scanbus
|cdrecord -speed{{=}}40 dev{{=}}2,0,0 -eject -dao driveropts{{=}}burnfree test.iso
}}

===== UDF =====

TODO

==== DVD/BD ====

===== BD defect management =====

By default {{c|growisofs}} uses defect management which requires 256MB extra space and uses reduced write speeds. You may disable this via:

{{Cmd|dvd+rw-format /dev/dvd -ssa{{=}}none}}

And use the following after writing to ensure files are properly written:

{{Cmd|diff -r /home/roger/Documents/ /mnt/tmp/}}

===== ISO =====

{{Cmd|growisofs -Z /dev/sr0{{=}}test.iso}}

===== UDF =====

Atypically, you can write with the following as long as you are within the limits of your DVD/BD media's size limitations:

{{Cmd|growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/sr0{{=}}test.udf}}

If you have used the above truncate with 25GB/50GB, specifying the top limits of BD media, you will need to disable Defect Management requiring 256MB extra space:

{{Cmd|growisofs -use-the-force-luke{{=}}spare:none -dvd-compat -speed{{=}}4 -Z /dev/sr0{{=}}test.udf}}
