{{Metadata|abstract=sshguard is an intrusion prevention system that parses server logs, determines malicious activity, and uses the system firewall to block the IP addresses of malicious connections.}}

<!--T:2-->
{{c|sshguard}} is an intrusion prevention system that parses server logs, determines malicious activity, and uses the system firewall to block the IP addresses of malicious connections. sshguard is written in C so it does not tax an interpreter.

== How it works == <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
sshguard is a simple daemon that continuously tracks one or more log files. It parses the log events that daemons send out in case of failed login attempts and then blocks any further attempts from those connections by updating the system's firewall.

<!--T:5-->
Unlike what the name implies, sshguard does not only parse SSH logs. It also supports many mail systems as well as a few FTP ones. A full listing of supported services can be found on the [https://www.sshguard.net sshguard.net website].

== Installation == <!--T:6-->

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-admin/sshguard}}

=== Emerge === <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
Install {{Package|app-admin/sshguard}}:

<!--T:9-->
{{Emerge|app-admin/sshguard}}

<!--T:10-->
Also make sure that {{Package|net-firewall/iptables}} is installed and used as the system firewall. At the time of writing, sshguard does not yet support {{Package|net-firewall/nftables}}.

<!--T:11-->
{{Emerge|net-firewall/iptables}}

<!--T:12-->
More information about using and configuring IPtables can also be found on the [[Iptables|IPtables article]].

== Configuration == <!--T:30-->

=== Preparing the firewall === <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
When sshguard blocks any malicious users (by blocking their IP addresses), it will use the {{c|sshguard}} chain.

<!--T:15-->
Prepare the chain, and make sure it is also triggered when new incoming connections are detected:

<!--T:16-->
{{RootCmd|iptables -N sshguard
|iptables -A INPUT -j sshguard}}

=== Watching logfiles === <!--T:17-->

<!--T:18-->
The basic idea behind sshguard is that the administrator passes on the log file(s) to watch as options to the application - there is no native sshguard configuration file.

<!--T:19-->
On Gentoo, the options can be best configured in the {{Path|/etc/sshguard.conf}} file:

<!--T:20-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sshguard.conf|title=Configuring sshguard to read /var/log/messages and /var/log/auth.log|lang=bash|1=
# Full path to backend executable (required, no default)
BACKEND="/usr/libexec/sshg-fw-iptables" 

# Space-separated list of log files to monitor. (optional, no default)
FILES="/var/log/messages /var/log/auth.log" 

# How many problematic attempts trigger a block
THRESHOLD="10"         
# Blocks last at least 12 hours (43200 seconds)
BLOCKTIME="43200"      
# Track IP addresses for 5 minutes (360 seconds)
DETECTION_TIME=604800  

# Size of IPv6 'subnet to block. Defaults to a single address, CIDR notation. (optional, default to 128)
IPV6_SUBNET=64
# Size of IPv4 subnet to block. Defaults to a single address, CIDR notation. (optional, default to 32)
IPV4_SUBNET=24

# Full path to PID file (optional, no default)
PID_FILE=/run/sshguard.pid
}}

<!--T:21-->
Make sure that the log files are accessible for the runtime user that sshguard uses.

=== Services === <!--T:22-->

==== OpenRC ==== <!--T:40-->

<!--T:23-->
Have sshguard be started by default by adding it to the default runlevel, and then start it:

<!--T:24-->
{{RootCmd
|rc-update add sshguard default
|rc-service sshguard start
}}

=== Blacklisting hosts === <!--T:41-->

<!--T:42-->
With the blacklisting option after a number of abuses the IP address of the attacker will be blocked permanently. The blacklist will be loaded at each startup and extended with new entries during operation. {{c|sshguard}} inserts a new address after it exceeded a threshold of abuses.

<!--T:43-->
Blacklisted addresses are never scheduled to be released (allowed) again.

<!--T:44-->
The <code>-b</code> command line option enables blacklisting and requires a filename to use for permanent storage of the blacklist. An optional threshold is configurable within the same option. This threshold is then first, after which the filename is mentioned separated by <code>:</code>.

<!--T:45-->
To enable blacklisting, create an appropriate directory and file:

<!--T:46-->
{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /var/db/sshguard
|touch /var/db/sshguard/blacklist.db
}}

<!--T:47-->
Add the blacklist file to the configuration and alter the <var>SSHGUARD_OPTS</var> variable:

<!--T:48-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/sshguard|title=Configuring sshguard to blacklist abusers|lang=bash|1=
PARDONTIME="3600" # Blocks last at least 1 hour (3600 seconds)
WATCHTIME="360"   # Track IP addresses for 5 minutes (360 seconds)
THRESHOLD="10"    # How many problematic attempts trigger a block
  
BLACKLIST="/var/db/sshguard/blacklist.db"            # Blacklisted addresses are in this file
LOGFILES="-l /var/log/messages"                      # Watch this file...
LOGFILES="${LOGFILES} -l /var/log/auth.log"          # And this one
  
SSHGUARD_OPTS="-b 50:${BLACKLIST} -p ${PARDONTIME} -s ${WATCHTIME} -a ${THRESHOLD} ${LOGFILES}"
}}

<!--T:49-->
Restart the {{c|sshguard}} daemon to have the changes take effect:

<!--T:50-->
{{RootCmd
|/etc/init.d/sshguard restart
}}

== Troubleshooting == <!--T:31-->

=== File '/var/log/auth.log' vanished while adding! === <!--T:32-->

<!--T:33-->
When starting up, sshguard reports the following error:

<!--T:34-->
{{CodeBox|title=Error message when trying to add a monitor for /var/log/auth.log|1=
Sep 23 03:39:11 foo.bar.com sshguard[64933]: File '/var/log/auth.log' vanished while adding!
}}

<!--T:35-->
Such an error (the file path itself can be different) occurs when the target file is not available on the system. Make sure that it is created, or update the sshguard configuration to not add it for monitoring.

<!--T:36-->
On a syslog-ng system with OpenRC, the following addition to {{Path|syslog-ng.conf}} can suffice:

<!--T:37-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf|title=creating auth.log file|lang=bash|1=
log { source(src); destination(messages); };
log { source(src); destination(console_all); };
 
destination authlog {file("/var/log/auth.log"); };
filter f_auth { facility(auth); };
filter f_authpriv { facility(auth, authpriv); };
log { source(src);  filter(f_authpriv);  destination(authlog);  };
}}

<!--T:38-->
Reload the configuration for the changes to take effect:

<!--T:39-->
{{RootCmd|rc-service syslog-ng reload}}
