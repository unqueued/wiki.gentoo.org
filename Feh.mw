'''feh''' is [[Article description::an open-source image viewer that is most aimed at command-line users.]] It can be used to view images on disk or, more often, for setting the desktop background for tiling [[window managers]] like [[i3]]. It has several command line options to change the behavior for either of these uses, mostly entered around how to resize the image for the view.

== Usage ==

=== Setting backgrounds ===

To use it to set one's desktop background to a scaled version of a wallpaper:

{{Cmd|feh --bg-scale /path/to/wallpaper}}

where {{Path|/path/to/wallpaper}} is the path to the wallpaper one wishes to use as desktop background. Likewise to set the desktop background to a tiled version of the wallpaper:

{{Cmd|feh --bg-tile /path/to/wallpaper}}

Adding these commands to {{Path|~/.xsession}} is an easy way to have the wallpaper set when X is started. Alternatively cron can be used to change the background in a time interval:

{{Cmd|crontab -e}}

{{CodeBox|1=
*/5 *  *  * * DISPLAY=":0.0" feh --randomize --bg-fill /path/to/wallpaper_library
}}

This will run feh every 5 minutes, and every time randomly chooses a picture from the directory {{Path|/path/to/wallpaper_library}}. The environment variable <var>DISPLAY</var> must be set inside of cron because cron was started before X. For more help with automated tasks on intervals, see the page for [[cron]].

=== Viewing images ===

feh can also be used as a standalone image viewer. feh can accept a single image, a number of images, or a directory as input.

{{Cmd|feh /path/to/image}}
{{Cmd|feh /path/to/directory}}
