'''feh''' is [[Article description::an open-source image viewer that is most aimed at command-line users.]] It can be used to view images on disk or, more often, for setting the desktop background for tiling [[window managers]] like [[i3]]. It has several command line options to change the behavior for either of these uses, mostly entered around how to resize the image for the view.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|media-gfx/feh}}:

{{Emerge|media-gfx/feh}}

== Usage ==

===Setting Backgrounds===

To use it to set one's desktop background to a scaled version of a wallpaper:

{{Cmd|feh --bg-scale /path/to/WALLPAPER}}

where {{Path|/path/to/WALLPAPER}} is the path to the wallpaper one wishes to use as desktop background. Likewise to set the desktop background to a tiled version of the wallpaper:

{{Cmd|feh --bg-tile /path/to/WALLPAPER}}

Adding these commands to your {{Path|~/.xsession}} is an easy way to have it set the wallpaper when X is started. You can also add a line to cron to have the background change in a time interval:

{{Cmd|crontab -e}}
{{CodeBox|1=
*/5 *  *  * * DISPLAY=":0.0" feh --randomize --bg-fill /path/to/wallpaper_library
}}

This will run feh every 5 minutes, and every time randomly chooses a picture from the folder {{Path|/path/to/wallpaper_library}}. The environment variable <code>DISPLAY</code> must be set inside of [[cron]] because cron was started before X. For more help with automated tasks on intervals, see the page for [[cron]].

===Viewing Images===
feh is also able to be used as a standalone image viewer. You can either specify a single image, a number of images, or a folder.

{{Cmd|feh /path/to/IMAGE.jpg}}
{{Cmd|feh /path/to/folder}}
