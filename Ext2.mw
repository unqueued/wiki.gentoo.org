'''ext2''' (second extended filesystem) is an open source disk [[filesystem]] created for Linux.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Activate the following kernel options for ext2 support:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling ext2 support|1=
File systems  --->
   <*> Second extended fs support
}}

Support for optional ext2 features: 

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling ext2|1=
File systems  --->
   [*]   Ext2 extended attributes
   [*]     Ext2 POSIX Access Control Lists
   [*]     Ext2 Security Labels

==== Large drive support ====

When the system has large disks (2 TB or greater) and a 32-bit ({{Keyword|x86}}) kernel is being used, the following option (<var>CONFIG_LBDAF</var>) must be enabled:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling large drives for {{Keyword|x86}} kernels|1=
-*- Enable the block layer  --->
    [*]   Support for large (2TB+) block devices and files
}}

=== USE flags ===

The {{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}} package contains the utilities to work with the filesystem. In Gentoo Linux {{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}} is part of the ''system'' set and should be already installed on the system.

{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/e2fsprogs}}

=== Emerge ===

After setting the USE flag update the system so the changes take effect:

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Usage ==

=== Creation ===

{{Warning|The {{c|mkfs.ext2}} command irreversibly destroys any content of the partition it is told to format. Be sure to select the right partition!}}

To create an ext2 filesystem on the {{Path|/dev/sda1}} partition:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda1}}

Please replace {{Path|/dev/sda1}} with the actual partition to format.

By default, 5% of available disk space is reserved for the ''root'' user. This is usually a good thing for the partition where the {{Path|/}} directory is mounted, but it may be not desirable on other partitions. To lose reserve disk space for the root user use {{c|mkfs.ext2}}'s <code>-m 0</code> option:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext2 -m 0 /dev/sda1}}
