== Maven on Gentoo ==
Maven, Ant and Gradle are very wide spread Java build systems.
Unfortunately it is not trivial to distribute source based ebuilds which require Maven.
(see https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Java_Packing_Policy#Maven)

As of 2019-06-23 we have only a binary ebuild for Maven ({{package|dev-java/maven-bin}}) in the official Gentoo tree.
However {{package|dev-java/maven}} is still not available {{bug|63285}}

== Google Summer of Code ==
Improving the support of Maven was goal of several Google Summer of Code projects:

* https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2019/Ideas#maven_support
* https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2019/Ideas/Maven_Java_overlay

== Packages waiting for Maven support ==
New packages for the tree which depend on Maven are organized by the tracker ticket {{bug|}}.
