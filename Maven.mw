== Maven on Gentoo ==
Maven, Ant and Gradle are very wide spread Java build systems.
Unfortunately it is not trivial to distribute source based ebuilds which require Maven.
(see https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Java_Packing_Policy#Maven)

As of 2019-06-23 we have only a binary ebuild for Maven ({{package|dev-java/maven-bin}}) in the official Gentoo tree.
