'''S'''imple '''D'''esktop '''D'''isplay '''M'''anager (SDDM) is [[Article description::a modern [[display manager]] that supports both the X11 server and the Wayland protocol.]]

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/sddm}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|x11-misc/sddm}}:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/sddm}}

If there are performance issues, it might help to add the sddm user to the video group:

{{RootCmd|usermod -a -G video sddm}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

SDDM has two configuration files: the package installed {{Path|/usr/share/sddm/sddm.conf.d/00default.conf}} and {{Path|/etc/sddm.conf}} which is used to override specific options.   The second is not created by the package.  KDE Plasma writes user changed options to {{Path|/etc/sddm.conf}}.  Both files have the same format.  See comments in the file and {{c|man 5 sddm.conf}} for details on available options.

===Prior to 0.18.0===

Prior to '''0.18.0''' the configuration was only in {{Path|/etc/sddm.conf}}.  Some of the files may have had to be generated manually.  If installing '''0.18.0''', skip ahead to [[#Service|Service section]].

==== Keymap ====

To select the correct keymap on the login screen, add following lines to the {{Path|/etc/sddm.conf}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sddm.conf|lang=ini|1=
[X11]
DisplayCommand=/etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup
}}
This file is not created automatically when the package is installed so you'll need to create it if you haven't done so already. 

Next create the directory {{Path|/etc/sddm/scripts }} 
{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /etc/sddm/scripts}}
and the file {{Path|/etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup }}.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup|lang=text|1=
setxkbmap gb,us
}}
the first country code is the default. 
Finally set execute permissions on the file {{Path|/etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup }}.
{{RootCmd|chmod a+x /etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup}}

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

Set SDDM as the default display manager:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="sddm"
}}

To start SDDM on boot, add xdm to the default runlevel:

{{Note|The dbus service gets pulled in dynamically.}}

{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

To start SDDM now:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

After logging in to the X session via sddm, it is a good idea to verify that ConsoleKit is working as intended. By typing {{c|ck-list-sessions}} all active sessions can be listed. The list should include your session, typically running on <code>x11-display-device = '/dev/tty7'</code>. This session should also read <code>active = TRUE</code>. Active being FALSE indicates an issue <ref>

==== systemd ====

To start SDDM on boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable sddm.service}}

To start SDDM now:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start sddm.service}}

=== Plasma ===

Graphical configuration is integrated in Plasma 5 system settings by installing {{Package|kde-plasma/sddm-kcm}}:

{{Emerge|kde-plasma/sddm-kcm}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Long load time before SDDM shows the greeter ===

A low entropy pool can cause long SDDM load time - see [https://github.com/sddm/sddm/issues/1036 upstream bug report]. If using systemd, the graphical target is reached and then everything appears to hang. Moving the mouse or using the keyboard will make the SDDM greeter launch (faster).

Solve the problem by using, for example, the {{Package|sys-apps/haveged}} package to increase the entropy pool or by enabling <var>RANDOM_TRUST_CPU</var> kernel config option [[wikipedia:RdRand|with a recent-enough CPU]].

=== Permission denied errors in Xorg.log ===

The X server will not start and permission denied errors (such as the following) are present in the {{Path|Xorg.log}} log file:

{{FileBox|filename=/var/log/Xorg.log|lang=text|1=
/var/log/Xorg.0.log:[ 2058.998] (EE) /dev/dri/card0: failed to set DRM interface version 1.4: Permission denied
/var/log/Xorg.0.log:[ 2061.229] (EE) intel(0): [drm] failed to set drm interface version: Permission denied [13].
}}

It is likely the sddm user has not been added to the video group. Running the following command should fix the problem:

{{RootCmd|usermod -a -G video sddm}}

=== Missing users ===

If the login screen is missing some user(s) to choose from, this might be caused by {{Path|/etc/sddm.conf}} - standard <code>MinimumUid</code> is 1000 and some existing users may have lower uids.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sddm.conf|lang=ini|1=
[Users]
MaximumUid=60000
MinimumUid=1000
}}
