'''S'''imple '''D'''esktop '''D'''isplay '''M'''anager (SDDM) is [[Article description::a modern [[display manager]] that supports both the X11 server and the Wayland protocol.]]

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/sddm}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|x11-misc/sddm}}:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/sddm}}

If there are performance issues, it might help to add the sddm user to the video group:

{{RootCmd|usermod -a -G video sddm}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

The global configuration file path for SDDM is {{Path|/etc/sddm.conf}}. See comments in the file and {{c|man 5 sddm.conf}} for details on available options.

{{Note|As of '''0.18.0''' SDDM no longer creates {{Path|/etc/sddm.conf}} but can be created to override specific options. SDDM defaults are now in {{Path|/usr/share/sddm/sddm.conf.d/00default.conf}}}}

=== Keymap ===

To select the correct keymap on the login screen, add following lines to the {{Path|/etc/sddm.conf }} file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sddm.conf|lang=text|1=
[X11]
DisplayCommand=/etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup
}}
This file is not created automatically when the package is installed so you'll need to create it if you haven't done so already. 

Next create the directory {{Path|/etc/sddm/scripts }} 
{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /etc/sddm/scripts}}
and the file {{Path|/etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup }}.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup|lang=text|1=
setxkbmap gb,us
}}
the first country code is the default. 
Finally set execute permissions on the file {{Path|/etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup }}.
{{RootCmd|chmod a+x /etc/sddm/scripts/Xsetup}}

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

Set SDDM as the default display manager:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="sddm"
}}

To start SDDM on boot, add xdm to the default runlevel:

{{Note|The dbus service gets pulled in dynamically.}}

{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

To start SDDM now:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

After logging in to the X session via sddm, it is a good idea to verify that ConsoleKit is working as intended. By typing {{c|ck-list-sessions}} all active sessions can be listed. The list should include your session, typically running on <code>x11-display-device = '/dev/tty7'</code>. This session should also read <code>active = TRUE</code>. Active being FALSE indicates an issue <ref>

==== systemd ====

To start SDDM on boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable sddm.service}}

To start SDDM now:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start sddm.service}}

=== Plasma ===

Graphical configuration is integrated in Plasma 5 system settings by installing {{Package|kde-plasma/sddm-kcm}}:

{{Emerge|kde-plasma/sddm-kcm}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Permission denied errors in Xorg.log ===

The X server will not start and permission denied errors (such as the following) are present in the {{Path|Xorg.log}} log file:

{{FileBox|filename=/var/log/Xorg.log|lang=text|1=
/var/log/Xorg.0.log:[ 2058.998] (EE) /dev/dri/card0: failed to set DRM interface version 1.4: Permission denied
/var/log/Xorg.0.log:[ 2061.229] (EE) intel(0): [drm] failed to set drm interface version: Permission denied [13].
}}

It is likely the sddm user has not been added to the video group. Running the following command should fix the problem:

{{RootCmd|usermod -a -G video sddm}}

=== Missing users ===

If the login screen is missing some user(s) to choose from, this might be caused by sddm.conf - standard MinimumUid is 1000 and some existing users may have lower Uids.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sddm.conf|lang=text|1=
[Users]
MaximumUid=60000
MinimumUid=1000
}}
