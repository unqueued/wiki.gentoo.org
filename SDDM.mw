DISPLAYMANAGER="sddm"
}}

After logging in to the X session via sddm, it is a good idea to verify that ConsoleKit is working as intended. By typing <kbd>ck-list-sessions</kbd> all active sessions can be listed. The list should include your session, typically running on <tt>x11-display-device = '/dev/tty7'</tt>. This session should also read <tt>active = TRUE</tt>. Active being FALSE indicates an issue <ref>

As a fix you can try editing {{Path| /etc/pam.d/system-login}} and removing the <tt>nox11</tt> from the line mentioning <tt>pam_ck_connector.so</tt>:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/pam.d/system-login|1=
...
session         optional        pam_ck_connector.so
...}}
