This page is intended to offer good answers why it is beneficial to build software from sources rather than installing binaries.

Building software from sources ..
* allows use of non-default build options ([[Handbook:Parts/Working/USE|USE flags]])
* allows use of custom compiler/linker flags (e.g. [[GCC optimization|runtime optimization]], [[Hardened Gentoo|hardening]], address sanitizer)
* reduces risk of running malicious code unnoticed (since it is harder to conceal in source code than in binaries)
