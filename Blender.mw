* unmask python 3.4 use flags by adding lines 
 -python_targets_python3_4
 -python_single_target_python3_4
to /etc/portage/profile/use.stable.mask
* use eapi 5
 cat /etc/portage/profile/eapi
 5
* setup blender use flags in /etc/portage/package.use:
 # blender
 media-gfx/blender python_targets_python3_4 python_single_target_python3_4 cycles openimageio player fftw openal
 dev-python/numpy python_targets_python3_4
 dev-python/chardet python_targets_python3_4
 dev-python/requests python_targets_python3_4
 dev-python/setuptools python_targets_python3_4
 </pre>}}
Use flags python_targets_python3_4 and python_single_target_python3_4 are required for python, the rest here are essential,
but not necessary:
{{UseFlag|package=media-gfx/blender
|cycles
|player
|fftw
|openal}}
* unmask related packages
{{RootCmd|
