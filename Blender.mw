Blender is a professional free and open-source 3D computer graphics software.

== Installation ==
Installation of Blender on Gentoo is rather complicated. Described setup works for version 2.72b, may quickly become obsolete.
* unmask python 3.4 use flags by adding lines 
 -python_targets_python3_4
 -python_single_target_python3_4
to /etc/portage/profile/use.stable.mask
* use eapi 5
 cat /etc/portage/profile/eapi
 5
* setup blender use flags in /etc/portage/package.use:
 # blender
 media-gfx/blender python_targets_python3_4 python_single_target_python3_4 cycles openimageio player fftw openal
 dev-python/numpy python_targets_python3_4
 dev-python/chardet python_targets_python3_4
 dev-python/requests python_targets_python3_4
 dev-python/setuptools python_targets_python3_4
 sci-libs/hdf5 -threads # with threads we would have to disable cxx and fortran
Use flags python_targets_python3_4 and python_single_target_python3_4 are required for python, the rest here are essential
for work with blender, but not necessary:
{{UseFlag|package=media-gfx/blender
|cycles
|player
|fftw
|openal}}
* unmask related packages by adding to /etc/portage/package.keywords
 media-gfx/blender ~amd64
 sci-libs/ldl ~amd64
* cycles has a bug and does not compile with gcc 4.8 and 4.9, to work around it, create a file
/etc/portage/patches/media-gfx/blender/blender.redefinition.patch
