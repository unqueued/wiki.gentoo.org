'''KDE''' 是自由软件社区，提供为数众多的应用程序，包括流行的 Plasma 桌面环境。

Gentoo support for KDE is excellent, with comprehensive packaging of the legacy KDE SC 4, next generation KDE Frameworks, Plasma, and Applications 5, as well as a wide array of other miscellaneous KDE-based software. 

== Prerequisites ==

=== Profile ===

Choosing an appropriate [[profile]], although not required, is recommended as it sets a number of global and package-specific USE flags to ease installation and ensure a smooth KDE experience.

In order to choose the most suitable profile, first list what's available:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|输出=<pre>
  [1]   default/linux/amd64/13.0
  [2]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
  [3]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop
  [4]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
  [5]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd
  [6]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde
  [7]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde/systemd
  [8]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/plasma
  [9]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/plasma/systemd
  ...
</pre>}}

Then, select the right profile, substituting <code>X</code> with the appropriate profile number:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set X}}

For a full KDE desktop environment it is recommended to use the <code>desktop/kde</code> profile, which is tailored for use with OpenRC. If systemd is used, choose <code>desktop/kde/systemd</code> instead. For Plasma 5 desktop environment choose <code>desktop/plasma</code> with OpenRC or <code>desktop/plasma/systemd</code> with systemd.

=== Services ===

Before installing KDE SC it is recommended that several other services are set up first. Part of that is done automatically if a ''desktop/kde'' or ''desktop'' [[profile]] is used. These services are: 
* [[D-Bus]]: Enables use of the D-Bus message bus system.
* [[polkit]]: Enables the polkit framework for controlling privileges for system-wide services.
* [[udev]]: Enables support for udev Linux dynamic and persistent device naming.
* [[udisks]]: Enables support for some storage related services.

Follow the links for information how to set up these services. Note that other USE flag combinations than set in this profile may technically be possible (especially if selected applications are run instead of a full KDE desktop environment), but may be unsupported, untested, or lead to unexpected loss of functionality.

=== X server ===

Read and follow the instructions in the [[X server]] article to setup the X environment.

== KDE SC 4 ==

KDE SC 4是前面的主要版本的KDE。没有更多的功能开发,但它仍然有上游bug修正版本的支持。它被认为是稳定的,是对大多数用户推荐的版本。

=== 可用版本 ===

{| {{{!}} class{{=}}"table"
! style{{=}}"background: #31206C; color: white; white-space: nowrap;" | KDE SC version
! style{{=}}"background: #31206C; color: white; white-space: nowrap;" | Status
|-
| KDE SC 4.14.3
| Stable for {{Keyword|amd64}}, {{Keyword|ppc}}, {{Keyword|ppc64}} and {{Keyword|x86}}; testing for {{Keyword|arm}}
|}

{{Note|As upstream support for KDE SC 4 slowly comes to an end, certain packages have releases with versions that do not not match the rest of the SC. For example, kdelibs enjoys further point releases beyond the last 4.14.3 SC release, and KDE Workspaces continues to receive bugfix releases as 4.11.x.}}

=== 软件包 ===

In Gentoo there are various packages that will install a KDE environment:
* {{Package|kde-base/kde-meta}}, the full KDE suite
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdebase-meta}}, a basic KDE environment
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-startkde}}, a very minimal, effectively unsupported KDE environment (no KDE applications or artwork)

It is usually a good idea to start with the {{Package|kde-apps/kdebase-meta}} package and install the additional software when needed:

{{Emerge|kde-apps/kdebase-meta}}

There are other meta packages that can be installed to pull in parts of the KDE suite:
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdeaccessibility-meta}}: Accessibility applications and utilities.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdeadmin-meta}}: Administrative utilities, which helps in managing the system.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdeartwork-meta}}: Extra themes, screensavers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebindings-meta}}: Bindings for various languages.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdeedu-meta}}: Educational applications and games.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdegames-meta}}: Standard desktop games.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdegraphics-meta}}: Graphics applications such as image viewers, color pickers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdemultimedia-meta}}: Audio and video playback applications and services.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdenetwork-meta}}: Network applications and VNC services.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-meta}}: PIM applications such as emailer, addressbook, organizer, etc.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdesdk-meta}}: Various development tools.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdetoys-meta}}: Toy like applications.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdeutils-meta}}: Standard desktop utilities such as a archiver, a calculator, etc.
* {{Package|kde-apps/kdewebdev-meta}}: Web development tools.

== 本地化 ==

To [[localization|localize]] the KDE installation, install the {{Package|kde-apps/kde4-l10n}} package. If only a selected few languages needs to set, define the <code>LINGUAS</code> variable beforehand in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}

E.g. to use the German language, set:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Setting the LINGUAS variable for the German language|lang=bash|1=
LINGUAS="de"
}}

{{Emerge|kde-apps/kde4-l10n}}

To localize the packages included in {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-meta}} install the {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-l10n}} package.

{{Package|app-office/calligra}} has its own localization package too: {{package|app-office/calligra-l10n}}.

=== Display manager ===

KDM (KDE Display Manager) is the recommended login manager and is pulled in automatically via {{package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}.

==== OpenRC ====

Set KDM as the default [[display manager]]:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
}}

To start KDM on boot, add xdm to the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

To start KDM now:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

==== systemd ====

Enable KDM at boot time through <tt>systemctl</tt>:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable kdm}}

Now start the service:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start kdm}}

== KDE Frameworks, Plasma,和 Applications 5 ==

The next generation of KDE splits the SC into three components, each with their own individual release cycles: KDE Frameworks 5, KDE Plasma 5, and KDE Applications.

=== Frameworks ===

KDE Frameworks 5 is a collection of libraries and software frameworks that provide the foundation for KDE Plasma 5 and KDE Applications 5, but may be leveraged by any Qt application.

As Frameworks are mostly libraries and provide little user functionality, it's not necessary to install them manually - the required packages will be pulled in automatically as dependencies.

=== Plasma ===

Plasma 5 is the next generation of KDE's desktop environment, based on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5. Upgrading is fairly simple, although it cannot be coinstalled with Plasma 4 due to upstream design decisions.

请注意，虽然等离子5是在一个良好的状态，但仍处于繁重的上游开发中，缺少目前在KDE4的一些功能。

Installation information can be found on the [[/Plasma_5_upgrade|upgrade page]].

== 附加软件==

=== 小工具 ===

Many useful widget are in the {{Package|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}} package. For KDE4, use:

{{Emerge|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}}

对于Plasma 5,你可能想要使用:

{{Emerge|kde-plasma/kdeplasma-addons}}

=== 更多KDE软件 ===

The most important KDE applications are in the portage tree and many are located in the [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-base kde-base] and [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-misc kde-misc] categories.
