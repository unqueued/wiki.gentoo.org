== Running as a restricted user ==

{{Warning|If you make this change after running the "normal" way, you'll need to empty the working directory {{Path|/var/lib/clamav-unofficial-sigs}} and delete the log file at {{Path|/var/log/clamav/clamav-unofficial-sigs.log}}. Otherwise you'll get access violations.}}

The {{Package|app-antivirus/clamav-unofficial-sigs}} package does not provide its own user, but it does share most of its privileges with {{Package|app-antivirus/clamav}}. So it makes some sense to run the unofficial update script as the ''clamav'' user. There are only a few steps to doing this:

First, give the ''clamav'' user a working shell:

{{RootCmd|usermod -s /bin/bash clamav}}

Now lock the account so no one can use it:

{{RootCmd|passwd -l clamav}}

Disable the user/group in the config file:

{{CodeBox|title=/etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf|lang=bash|1=
#clam_user="clam"
#clam_group="clam"
}}

And now, run the script (in a cron job or wherever) as the ''clamav'' user:

{{RootCmd|su clamav -c /usr/sbin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh}}
