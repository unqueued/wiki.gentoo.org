'''Budgie''' is the flagship desktop of the [https://solus-project.com Solus Project]. It focuses on simplicity and elegance and is tightly integrated with the GNOME 3 stack. 

{{Note|The Budgie desktop environment currently is not in the main Gentoo repository; 10.3.1 is available for {{Keyword|~amd64}} and {{Keyword|~x86}} using the Sabayon overlay. Please report bugs at https://bugs.solus-project.com/ and provide sufficient details (how to reproduce, info, logs, errors, etc).}}

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===

Budgie currently resides in the Sabayon overlay. Ensure {{c|[[layman]]}} has been installed before proceeding with this installation. The ''Sabayon'' overlay is also a requirement since Budgie has is not currently included in the main Gentoo repository.

{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|output=<pre>
  [1]   default/linux/amd64/13.0
  [2]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
  [3]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop *
  [4]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
  [5]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd
  [6]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde

  ...
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set 12}}
