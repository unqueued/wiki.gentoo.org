'''Budgie''' is the flagship desktop of the [https://solus-project.com Solus Project]. It focuses on simplicity and elegance and is tightly integrated with the GNOME 3 stack. 

{{Note|The Budgie desktop environment currently is not in the Portage tree; 8.2 is available for ~amd64 and ~x86 using the Sabayon overlay. If you have found a bug, please report it at https://bugs.solus-project.com/ and provide sufficient details (reproducement, info, logs, errors).}}


== Installation ==
Budgie currently resides in the Sabayon overlay. You will first need to ensure you have [[layman]] installed. Then you will need to add the ''Sabayon'' overlay.
=== Profile ===

In order to choose the most suitable profile, first list what's available:
{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|output=<pre>
  [1]   default/linux/amd64/13.0
  [2]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
  [3]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop *
  [4]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
  [5]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd
  ...
</pre>}}

Then, select the right profile, substituting the appropriate profile number (which may vary between configurations):

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set 5}}

Any packages affected by the profile change need to be rebuilt:
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --changed-use --deep world}}

=== USE flags ===
Enable or disable desired USE flags for {{Package|gnome-extra/budgie-desktop}}.
{{USEflag|package=gnome-extra/budgie-desktop|desc=USE flags for {{Package|gnome-extra/budgie-desktop}}:
|vala+yes+yes+Enable support for dev-lang/vala}}

=== Packages ===

Once [[layman]] is installed and the ''Sabayon'' overlay added, you can install the Budgie Desktop Environment with
{{Emerge|gnome-extra/budgie-desktop}}
