The <code>SYNC</code> variable located in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} was used to set the rsync server to update the Portage tree from. It has been deprecated in favor of using a modular sync system defined in [[Project:Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration|{{Path|/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf}}]].
