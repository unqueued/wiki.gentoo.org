The <code>SYNC</code> variable located in {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/make.conf|/etc/portage/make.conf]]}} was used to set the rsync server URL in order to update the main Gentoo repository. <code>SYNC</code> has been ''deprecated'' in favor of using new the plug-in sync system defined in [[Project:Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration|{{Path|/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf}}]].

{{Tip|Although <code>SYNC</code> can still be used in most cases it is recommended all users upgrade repository syncing on their systems to use the new {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf]]}} configuration.}}
