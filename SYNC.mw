{{warning|The SYNC variable is ''deprecated'' in current versions of {{package|sys-apps/portage}}. See the "repos.conf" section in the Portage man page for up-to-date documentation on how to set the repository URI:

{{Cmd|man 5 portage}} 

Further information concerning this change is also available in the [[Project:Portage/Sync|Portage Project's Sync article]].}}

The SYNC variable - in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} - used to contain a rsync server URI to be used when updating the Portage tree. It has been depreciated in favor of using a modular sync system defined in {{Path|/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf}}

A list of [https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/ community mirrors] is maintained on the Gentoo site.

== Choosing a mirror ==

A good rsync mirror can make Portage download source code (distfiles) faster. Choosing a mirror with the [[mirrorselect|mirrorselect]] tool is generally a good idea.

{{Cmd|mirrorselect -i -r -o >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

{{Note|Try choosing a rotation, such as rsync.us.gentoo.org, rather than choosing a single mirror. This helps spread out the load and provides a fail-safe in case a specific mirror is offline.}}
