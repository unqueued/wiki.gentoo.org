'''The SYNC variable - in /etc/make.conf - contains the rsync server you want to use when updating your Portage tree'''
The collection of ebuilds, scripts containing all the information Portage needs to download and install software.

A list of [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml  community mirrors] is maintained on the Gentoo site.

== Choosing a mirror ==
A good mirror can make Portage download source code faster. Usually, you can choose a mirror (with [[mirrorselect|mirrorselect]]) that is near you.
{{Cmd|mirrorselect -i -r -o >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

{{Note|Try choosing a rotation, such as rsync.us.gentoo.org, rather than choosing a single mirror. This helps spread out the load and provides a failsafe in case a specific mirror is offline.}}
