Quagga is a free software routing suite supporting open routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, BGP.

==Installation==
{{USEflag|package=net-misc/quagga
|bgpclassless 
|caps 
|doc 
|ipv6+yes
|multipath

{{emerge|quagga}}

{{RootCmd|rc-update add quagga default}}

Before starting zebra you have to configure it, by creating a {{Path|/etc/quagga/zebra.conf}} file.
{{RootCmd|bzcat /usr/share/doc/quagga-0.99.22.4/samples/zebra.conf.sample.bz2 > /etc/quagga/zebra.conf}}

Start zebra daemon
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/quagga start}}

Verify zebra is running:
{{RootCmd|netstat -tulpen {{!}} grep zebra|output=<pre>
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:2601            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      114        21947582   23564/zebra
</pre>}}

==Services==
The Quagga routing suite consists of 2 parts:
* zebra daemon
* routing proceses (RIP,OSPF,BGP)

The zebra daemon is a abstraction layer between the kernel and between the running routing processes.

Quagga installed on a linux machine acts as a dedicated router. Quagga updates the kernel routing table.
It modifies interface IP addressing, sets static routes, also enables dynamic routing with routing protocols mentioned above.

Usually a linux router has dedicated tools to set interface addressing, and configure static routing f.e. with 
* {{Package|sys-apps/iproute2}}
* {{Package|sys-apps/net-tools}}

These mentioned tools work only with root access. Quagga has a different user management and can change, add and modify the linux routing table without having privileged root access to a dedicated machine.
Quagga is a tool to modify the IP configuration of a host without having root access to a physical machine.

==Configuration==
The default quagga configuration has following user credentials for login in
{{RootCmd| grep -v ! /etc/quagga/zebra.conf|output=<pre>
hostname Router
password zebra
enable password zebra
</pre>}}

Login to local daemon using password ''zebra''
{{Cmd
|telnet localhost 2601
|output=<pre>
telnet localhost 2601
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
