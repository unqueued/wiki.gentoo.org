'''portageq''' is a tool to quickly query Portage information. It is primarily used by Gentoo developers in order to determine Portage configuration information.

== Installation ==

Every Gentoo system should have {{c|portageq}} installed. Run a quick test by issuing the the <code>--help</code> option as seen in the [[#Usage|usage section]] below.

If usage instructions are not displayed to the terminal there is certainly a problem. It is possible to (re)install Portage by following the Portage [[Portage#Installation|installation instructions]].

== Usage ==

=== Invocation ===

{{Invocation|portageq --help|output=<pre>
>>> Portage information query tool
>>> 2.2.20.1
>>> Usage: portageq <command> [<option> ...]

Available commands:
   all_best_visible <eroot>
      Returns all best_visible packages (without .ebuild).
   available_eclasses <eroot> <repo_id>+
      Returns space-separated list of available eclasses for specified repository.
   best_version <eroot> <category/package>
      Returns highest installed matching category/package-version (without .ebuild).
   best_visible <eroot> [pkgtype] <atom>
      Returns category/package-version (without .ebuild).
      The pkgtype argument defaults to "ebuild" if unspecified,
      otherwise it must be one of ebuild, binary, or installed.
   colormap Display the color.map as environment variables.
   config_protect Returns the CONFIG_PROTECT paths.
   config_protect_mask Returns the CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK paths.
   contents <eroot> <category/package>
      List the files that are installed for a given package, with
      one file listed on each line. All file names will begin with
      <eroot>.
   distdir Returns the DISTDIR path.
   eclass_path <eroot> <repo_id> <eclass>+
      Returns the path to specified eclass for specified repository.
   envvar <variable>+
      Returns a specific environment variable as exists prior to ebuild.sh.
      Similar to: emerge --verbose --info | egrep '^<variable>='
   expand_virtual <eroot> <atom>
      Returns a \n separated list of atoms expanded from a
      given virtual atom (GLEP 37 virtuals only),
      excluding blocker atoms. Satisfied
      virtual atoms are not included in the output, since
      they are expanded to real atoms which are displayed.
      Unsatisfied virtual atoms are displayed without
      any expansion. The "match" command can be used to
      resolve the returned atoms to specific installed
      packages.
   filter_protected <eroot>
      Read filenames from stdin and write them to stdout if they are protected.
      All filenames are delimited by \n and must begin with <eroot>.
   gentoo_mirrors Returns the mirrors set to use in the portage configuration.
   get_repo_path <eroot> <repo_id>+
      Returns the path to the repo named argv[1], argv[0] = $EROOT
   get_repos <eroot>
      Returns all repos with names (repo_name file) argv[0] = $EROOT
   has_version <eroot> <category/package>
      Return code 0 if it's available, 1 otherwise.
   is_protected <eroot> <filename>
      Given a single filename, return code 0 if it's protected, 1 otherwise.
      The filename must begin with <eroot>.
   license_path <eroot> <repo_id> <license>+
      Returns the path to specified license for specified repository.
   list_preserved_libs <eroot>
      Print a list of libraries preserved during a package update in the form
      package: path. Returns 1 if no preserved libraries could be found,
      0 otherwise.
   mass_best_version <eroot> [<category/package>]+
      Returns category/package-version (without .ebuild).
   mass_best_visible <eroot> [<type>] [<category/package>]+
      Returns category/package-version (without .ebuild).
      The pkgtype argument defaults to "ebuild" if unspecified,
      otherwise it must be one of ebuild, binary, or installed.
   master_repos <eroot> <repo_id>+
      This is an alias for the master_repositories command.
   master_repositories <eroot> <repo_id>+
      Returns space-separated list of master repositories for specified repository.
   match <eroot> <atom>
      Returns a \n separated list of category/package-version.
      When given an empty string, all installed packages will
      be listed.
   metadata <eroot> <pkgtype> <category/package> [<key>]+
      Returns metadata values for the specified package.
      Available keys: DEFINED_PHASES,DEPEND,DESCRIPTION,EAPI,HDEPEND,HOMEPAGE,INHERITED,IUSE,KEYWORDS,LICENSE,PDEPEND,PROPERTIES,PROVIDE,RDEPEND,REQUIRED_USE,RESTRICT,SLOT,SRC_URI
   owners <eroot> [<filename>]+
      Given a list of files, print the packages that own the files and which
      files belong to each package. Files owned by a package are listed on
      the lines below it, indented by a single tab character (\t). All file
      paths must either start with <eroot> or be a basename alone.
      Returns 1 if no owners could be found, and 0 otherwise.
   pkgdir Returns the PKGDIR path.
   portdir Returns the PORTDIR path.
      Deprecated in favor of get_repo_path command.
   portdir_overlay Returns the PORTDIR_OVERLAY path.
      Deprecated in favor of get_repos & get_repo_path or repos_config commands.
   pquery [options] [atom]+
      Emulates a subset of Pkgcore's pquery tool.
   repos_config <eroot>

   repositories_configuration <eroot>
      Returns the configuration of repositories.
   vdb_path Returns the path used for the var(installed) package database for the

Pkgcore pquery compatible options:

usage: portageq pquery [options] [atom ...]

Repository matching options:

                        masking, etc)
  --repo REPO           repository to use (all repositories are used by
                        default)

  --maintainer-email MAINTAINER_EMAIL

Output formatting:
  -n, --no-version      collapse multiple matching versions together

=== Querying environment variables ===

Probably the only question users will have as they read through the help output above is the definition of ''eroot''. eroot simply means the repository filesystem path (directory) and can be obtained by:

{{Cmd|portageq envvar EROOT|output=<pre>
/
</pre>}}

Queryable [[Portage]] specific environmental variables are listed in {{path|[[:/usr/portage/profiles]]/info_vars}}. The queryable user environment's [[Handbook:AMD64/Working/EnvVar#Environment_variables|environment variables]] can be shown using the {{c|env}} command.

Return the <var>CONFIG_PROTECT</var> variable value (should be a filesystem path):

{{Cmd|portageq config_protect}}

Return the <var>DISTDIR</var> variable value (should be a filesystem path):

{{Cmd|portageq distdir|output=<pre>
/usr/portage/distfiles
</pre>}}

Return the <var>PKGDIR</var> variable value (should be a filesystem path):

{{Cmd|portageq pkgdir|output=<pre>
/usr/portage/packages
</pre>}}

=== Query repository information ===

To see a detailed list of repositories as configured in [[:/etc/portage/repos.conf|repos.conf]], without any formatting:

{{Cmd|portageq repos_config /}}

As before, but without details:

{{Cmd|portageq get_repos /}}

== Removal ==

Simply put, removing the package management system on Gentoo is a bad idea. Do not do it!
