The <var>PORTDIR</var> variable was used to point to the main package repository hosted on the system. It has since been {{Bug|546210|text=deprecated}} in favor of individual configuration files in the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf|/etc/portage/repos.conf]]}} file or directory.</onlyinclude>

The current value of the <code>location</code> attribute can be obtained by using [[portageq]]:

{{Cmd|portageq get_repo_path / gentoo|output=<pre>
/usr/portage</pre>}}
