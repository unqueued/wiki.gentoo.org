===Keywording after EAPI bump===
An EAPI bump requires usually that all keywords are set to `~`. This can be done with 
{{Cmd| ekeyword ~all foo-2.0.ebuild}}
from the package {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}.

However there are some special cases where a stabilization can remain, if the developer can be 100% sure, that the EAPI change does not change anything. But this is not the case for usual packages.

===Use the latest EAPI for a pull request===
We always try to use the latest EAPI, if possible. 
If a required eclass is not yet compatible with the latest EAPI this can not be full filled directly.
