===Keywording after EAPI bump===
An EAPI bump requires usually that all keywords are set to `~`
{{Cmd| ekeyword ~all foo-2.0.ebuild}}
However there are some special cases where a stabilization can remain, if the developer can be 100% sure, that the EAPI change does not change anything. But this is not the case for usual packages.
