=== When an ebuild needs a revbump (-r1) ===

  EAPI change -> revbump    
  change patches -> revbump    
  change HOMEPAGE -> no revbump    
  change SRC_URI, but checksum same -> no revbump    

Note: if the checksum differs after changing <code>SRC_URI</code>, it is OK not to revbump if you have compared the contents of the 2 tarballs and confirmed they contain no difference. The checksum will mismatch if the 2 tarballs were compressed with different settings.

=== Keywording after EAPI bump ===

An EAPI bump requires usually that all keywords are set to `~` (unstable). This can be done with:

{{Cmd|ekeyword ~all foo-2.0.ebuild}}

From the package {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}.

However there are some special cases where a stabilization can remain, if the developer can be 100% sure, that the EAPI change does not change anything. But this is not the case for usual packages.

=== Sorting of KEYWORDS ===

We usually sort the <var>KEYWORDS</var> values as ekeyword does. This makes comparison between packages easier. 
Simply run ekeyword on the ebuild to let it sort.

{{Cmd| ekeyword foo-2.0.ebuild}}

=== Use the latest EAPI for a pull request ===

We always try to use the latest EAPI, if possible. 
If a required eclass is not yet compatible with the latest EAPI this can not be full filled directly.

=== Breaking tests in parallel building mode ===

Tests after ebuild compile run in the same mode, but sometimes test fails in parallel. In this case tests should be called with <code>-j 1</code>:

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
  src_test() {
    # Via environment method 1
    MAKEOPTS+=" -j1" test-command
  }
}}

Alternatively:

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
  src_test() {
    # Via environment method 2
    # Need check
    local MAKEOPTS+=" -j1" 
    test-command
  }
}}

When importing cmake.eclass allows direct a setting of <code>-j1</code>:

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
# When cmake-utils.eclass src_test function
  src_test() {
    cmake-utils_src_test -j1
  }
}}
