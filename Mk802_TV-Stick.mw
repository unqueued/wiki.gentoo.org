== Revive an Allwinner TV-Stick with Mainline Kernel (plus a small patch) ==

Use RCN multiplatform repo for now, or just grab the patches from patches/sunxi on the latest branch (v4.7.x) and apply them to your kernel source.

[//github.com/RobertCNelson/armv7-multiplatform armv7-multiplatform]

Follow RCN wiki steps for building from his repo and deploying u-boot; there is also an mk802_defconfig in the above patch dir (recommended).  The A20 OLinuXino-LIME steps also work for mk802, just replace the machine name.

The device tree patches add additional clocks and hardware (from the upstream sunxi-next branch) and set the OTG (mini-USB) port to host mode.  With the port set to OTG mode in the device tree, the kernel module will not switch to host mode, so if you need a real USB 2.0 host port, then you need these patches.  Note the full-size host port on the stick is OHCI/USB 1.0 '''only''' so a network adapter will be annoyingly slow.  Use the mini-port and things are '''much''' less annoying.  Also note that this whole thing requires a TV stick with a micro-SDCard slot.
