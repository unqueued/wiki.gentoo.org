To add a certificate (for example your or your organization's internal CA certificate) to the systemwide list of trusted certificates, place the new certificate in {{Path|/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/}}. 

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/|cp path/to/my.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/}}

Make sure users have necessary read access to the directory/certificates, or users won't trust them due to read failures. Also make sure untrusted users don't have write access!

Then either run {{RootCmd|update-ca-certificates}} or rebuild {{Package|app-misc/ca-certificates}} with {{RootCmd|emerge -1 app-misc/ca-certificates}} to add the certificates to {{Path|/etc/ssl/certs/}}.
