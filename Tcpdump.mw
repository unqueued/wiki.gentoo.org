{{c|tcpdump}} is [[Article description::a command-line network monitoring and data acquisition tool.]] It is capable of sniffing packets and "dumping" information.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-analyzer/tcpdump}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{c|tcpdump}}:

{{Emerge|net-analyzer/tcpdump}}

== Configuration ==

=== SUID ===

In order for normal users to run {{c|tcpdump}} the program should be built with the <code>suid</code> flag enabled and the user(s) should be added to the tcpdump group.

{{RootCmd|USE{{=}}"suid" emerge -a --changed-use tcpdump}}

Do this by using the {{c|usermod}} command where <code><username></code> is user's username:

{{RootCmd|usermod -a -G tcpdump <username>}}

== Usage ==

=== Invocation ===

The root user can invoke {{c|tcpdump}} at any time:

{{RootCmd|tcpdump -h|output=<pre>
Usage: tcpdump [-aAbdDefhHIJKlLnNOpqRStuUvxX#] [ -B size ] [ -c count ]
                [ -C file_size ] [ -E algo:secret ] [ -F file ] [ -G seconds ]
                [ -i interface ] [ -j tstamptype ] [ -M secret ] [ --number ]
                [ -Q in|out|inout ]
                [ -r file ] [ -s snaplen ] [ --time-stamp-precision precision ]
                [ --immediate-mode ] [ -T type ] [ --version ] [ -V file ]
                [ -w file ] [ -W filecount ] [ -y datalinktype ] [ -z command ]
                [ -Z user ] [ expression ]
</pre>}}

When {{c|tcpdump}} has been set with SUID permissions normal users can invoke it, however since the {{Path|/usr/sbin}} directory is not included in a normal user's path, the full path must be specified:

{{Cmd|/usr/sbin/tcpdump}}

=== Listing interfaces ===

To discover the interfaces available to {{c|tcpdump}} issue the following command:

{{Cmd|/usr/sbin/tcpdump --list-interfaces}}

=== Specifying an interface ===

After an output of available interfaces has been displayed it is possible to select a specific interface upon which to listen:

{{Cmd|/usr/sbin/tcpdump -i <interface_name>}}

Where <code><interface_name></code> is either the number of the interface or the string version of the name.

=== Write output to a file ===

Running {{c|tcpdump}} with the <code>-w</code> instructs the program to write output to a file. This is helpful to future analysis:

{{Cmd|/usr/sbin/tcpdump -w /tmp/output}}

=== Read input from a file ===

{{Cmd|/usr/sbin/tcpdump -r /tmp/output}}
