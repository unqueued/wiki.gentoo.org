|Cross Container Support|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 

It is already possible to create fully working chroot using qemu-user and build quickly packages through it, the natural step further is to make it work as a normal container, providing a similar interface to manage it. This way build for arm targets can be done on faster systems and sidetracks also issues about python and perl not supporting proper cross compilation or widespread build systems such waf and cmake failing completely at the task.
