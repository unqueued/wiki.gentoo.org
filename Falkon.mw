'''QupZilla''' is a lightweight web browser based on qtwebkit.

==Overview==
Being quite lean, QupZilla is visually attractive and functional. It excellently integrates into desktop environments and looks good on KDE and Razor-qt.

==Install==
{{USEflag|package=www-client/qupzilla
|dbus
|debug
|kde
|nonblockdialogs
}}
Install {{Package|www-client/qupzilla}}:
{{emerge|www-client/qupzilla}}

==Use on Hardened Gentoo==
The latest versions provide more funcionality, plugins and nice features; however, the MPROTECT PaX flag is disabled in unstable ebuilds because of flash. If you don't use flash, enable the MPROTECT flag with the following command:

{{RootCmd|paxctl -M /usr/bin/qupzilla}}

It will enable secure memory protections again. Check PaX flags with this command:

{{RootCmd|paxctl -v /usr/bin/qupzilla}}
