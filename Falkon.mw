'''QupZilla''' is [[Article description::a lightweight web browser based on QtWebEngine]].

==Overview==
Being quite lean, QupZilla is visually attractive and functional. It excellently integrates into desktop environments and looks good on KDE and LXQt.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=www-client/qupzilla}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|www-client/qupzilla}}:

{{emerge|www-client/qupzilla}}

==Use on Hardened Gentoo==
The latest versions provide more functionality, plugins and nice features; however, the MPROTECT PaX flag is disabled in unstable ebuilds because of Flash. If you don't use Flash, enable the MPROTECT flag with the following command:

{{RootCmd|paxctl -M /usr/bin/qupzilla}}

It will enable secure memory protections again. Check PaX flags with this command:

{{RootCmd|paxctl -v /usr/bin/qupzilla}}
