With a non rooted device, the only things you can backup locally is what the couple device/android will let you do. That is pretty much the same files you can copy with the already mentioned software. With the Android 4.x devices, a nice solution to make such a partial backup is the so-called [https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/28296/full-backup-of-non-rooted-devices/28315#28315 "adb backup"].

== ADB - Dumpsys ==

A tool that runs on Android devices and provides information about system services
̺
To get a diagnostic output for all system services for your connected device, simply run adb shell dumpsys. However, this outputs far more information than you would typically want. For more manageable output, specify the service you want to examine by including it in the command. 

The general syntax for using dumpsys is as follows
{{Cmd|adb shell dumpsys [-t timeout] [--help] [-l] [--skip services] [service] [arguments] [-c] [-h]}}

Here is an example when we dumping battery stats
{{Cmd|adb shell dumpsys battery}}

  AC powered: false
  USB powered: true
  Wireless powered: false
  Max charging current: 500000
  Max charging voltage: 5000000
  Charge counter: 0
  status: 2
  health: 2
  present: true
  level: 45
  scale: 100
  voltage: 3826
  temperature: 240
  technology: Li-poly

To list what is available to dump you can typeː
{{Cmd|adb shell dumpsys -l}}

If above command does not work then you can useː
{{Cmd|adb shell dumpsys {{!}} grep -a 'DUMP OF SERVICE'}}
