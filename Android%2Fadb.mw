With a non rooted device, the only things you can backup locally is what the couple device/android will let you do. That is pretty much the same files you can copy with the already mentioned software. With the Android 4.x devices, a nice solution to make such a partial backup is the so-called [https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/28296/full-backup-of-non-rooted-devices/28315#28315 "adb backup"].

'''adb''' mean Android Debug Bridge<ref>http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html</ref>, and it is a part of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK)<ref>https://developer.android.com/sdk/</ref>. It can be installed with  android-sdk-update-manager<ref>{{Package|dev-util/android-sdk-update-manager}}</ref>
{{Emerge|android-sdk-update-manager}}
or with android-tools<ref>{{Package|dev-util/android-tools}}</ref>.
{{Emerge|dev-util/android-tools}}

When it is done, you may have to logout and login in order to backup the files with
{{Cmd|<nowiki>adb backup [-f <file>] [-apk|-noapk] [-shared|-noshared] [-all] [-system|nosystem] [<packages...>]</nowiki>}}
where
* -f : the path of the *.ab file that will be saved on your computer. This file is a compressed file that contains an archive of the data/apks from your device.
* -apk|-noapk : indicates if the *.apk files should be backed up (default is -noapk)
* -shared|-noshared: enable/disable backup of the device's shared storage / SD card contents (default is -noshared)
* -all : indicates that you want the entire system backed up. you can use the packages filter to just backup specific packages, or use -all for a full system backup.
* -system|-nosystem: indicates if all the system applications and data are included when backing up. (default is -system)
* <packages> : this is where you can list specific packages to backup. Use these if you want to back up only specific applications. If using -all, you do not need to specify packages.

To backup the phone into '''~/HTC_backup''' :
{{Cmd|cd ~}}
{{Cmd|mkdir HTC_backup}}
{{Cmd|adb devices}}
will start the daemon and show you the devices on the USB.
{{Cmd|adb backup -apk -shared -all -system -f ~/HTC_backup/backup<date_of_the_day>.ab}}
will backup every thing the device will let you to backup.
{{Cmd|adb restore ~/HTC_backup/backup<date_of_the_day>.ab}}
will restore the backup into the device.
