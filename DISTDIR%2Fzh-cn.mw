'''DISTDIR变量定义了Portage将会把下载的源码存放到哪里。默认值是{{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles}}'''。

This location, which is also often referred to as the ''distfiles'' location, will host the source code archives of all software ever installed (or attempted to install) on the system. This location is not automatically cleaned up though, so you might want to use tools such as '''eclean-dist''' (part of {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}) to keep the storage used by this location under control. Please read the [[Eclean]] article for more details.

Users can set this variable in <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code>.
