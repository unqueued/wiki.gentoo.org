DOSBox: the famous DOS-emulator that uses the SDL-library. It emulates CPU:286/386 realmode/protected mode, Directory FileSystem/XMS/EMS, Tandy/Hercules/CGA/EGA/VGA/VESA graphics and a SoundBlaster/Gravis Ultra Sound card for excellent sound compatibility with older games. No matter which oldschool dos game you want to play... ''Dune II'', ''Monkey Island'' or ''Syndicate'', dosbox runs them all. Also see the [http://www.dosbox.com/comp_list.php?letter=a compatibility list] and the [http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Main_Page wiki] for help.
