[http://www.broadbandbuyer.co.uk/Shop/ShopDetail.asp?ProductID=7226 Thomson TG587n] is a decent wireless-N broadband router (currently offered by O2 on high-end packages). This router has 2 USB ports for content sharing.

== Configuring Content Sharing using Thomson Web Interface ==
The configuration is quite simple. Open the web interface (default to 192.168.1.254) and go to the following section
{{Code|Thomson Content Sharing|<pre>Toolbox->Content Sharing->Configure</pre>}}

We only care about the first section ( Network File Server (Windows Networking) ). Let's assume your configuration looks like this
{{Code|Thomson Content Sharing Configuration|<pre>
Server Name: O2-Foobar
Server Description: My Media Server
Workgroup: WORKGROUP
Server Enabled: Yes (this must be enabled)
</pre>}}

Make sure that you have selected your disk (Only '''FAT32''' or '''NTFS''' format for now) on ''List of connected disks'' field

The Network File Server exposes the following two folders to the clients
* Media
* Shared

== Client Configuration ==
The shares are accessible through the smb:// protocol. The smbfs has been replaced by the cifs protocol so this is what we will use to access the disk from our Gentoo box

=== Kernel Configuration ===
The kernel needs to be configured like this
{{Kernel||<pre>
File Systems --->
     [*] Network File Systems --->
        [*] CIFS support (advanced network filesystem, SMBFS successor)--->
             [*] CIFS Statistics
                  [*] Extended Statistics
             [*] CIFS Extended Attributes
                  [*] CIFS POSIX Extentions
</pre>}}

=== Necessary System Tools ===
We don't really want the full samba package, hence we will install only the [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/net-fs/mount-cifs net-fs/mount-cifs] package
{{ShellRoot|emerge -av mount-cifs}}

=== Mount the shared content ===
Now that our client is fully configured we can access the shares like this
==== Create the mount point ====
{{ShellRoot|mkdir -p /mnt/My-Disk/<nowiki>{</nowiki>Media,Shared<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}
==== Mount the exported folders ====
{{ShellRoot|mount.cifs //O2-Foobar/Media /mnt/My-Disk/Media -o guest}}
{{ShellRoot|mount.cifs //O2-Foobar/Shared /mnt/My-Disk/Shared -o guest}}

===== Automatically mount shares on every boot =====
If you want to automatically mount your shares on every boot, then edit your '''/etc/fstab''' to look like this
{{File|/etc/fstab|Add CIFS entries|<pre>
//O2-Foobar/Media /mnt/My-Disk/Media cifs guest
//O2-Foobar/Shared /mnt/My-Disk/Shared cifs guest
</pre>}}
{{Note|In case you get permission problems when trying to create files and folders in your disk, try to use gid{{=}}<your_user_gid>, uid{{=}}<your_user_uid> in your '''/etc/fstab''' entries}}

== Known Issues ==
The following problems may pop up when trying to mount your shiny new CIFS shares
=== Cannot Resolve <Server-Name> ===
And more specifically, the actual error looks like this
{{Code|Name Resolution Problem|<pre>
"mount error: could not find target server. TCP name foo/bar not found. No ip
address specified and hostname not found"
</pre>}}

This can easily be fixed by editing /etc/nsswitch and appending '''wins''' next to '''hosts''' entry
{{File|/etc/nsswitch|Configuration|<pre>
hosts: files dns wins
</pre>}}

If this does not work, you can use the NFS server's IP address instead of the O2-Foobar hostname.
{{Warning|The IP address for NFS server in Thomson router is '''192.168.1.253'''}}
You can use the '''nmblookup''' utility (provided by the {{Package|net-fs/samba}}) to find out the IP address of an NFS host
{{ShellRoot|nmblookup O2-Foobar}}
