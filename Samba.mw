'''Samba''' is a re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol, a Microsoft Windows alternative to Network File System ([[NFS]]).

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Activate the following kernel options:
{{KernelBox|title=Enable CIFS|1=
File Systems --->
    [*] Network File Systems --->
        [*] CIFS support (advanced network filesystem, SMBFS successor)--->
            [*] CIFS Statistics
                [*] Extended Statistics
            [*] CIFS Extended Attributes
                [*] CIFS POSIX Extentions
}}

=== Samba ===

==== USE flags ====

{{USEflag|package=net-fs/samba|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|net-fs/samba}}:
|acl+Yes
|addns
|ads
|aio+Yes
|avahi
|caps
|cluster
|client+Yes
|cups
|debug
|dmapi
|doc
|examples
|fam
|ldap
|ldb
|netapi+Yes
|pam+Yes
|quota
|readline+Yes
|server+Yes
|smbclient+Yes
|smbsharemodes
|selinux
|swat
|syslog
|winbind+Yes
}}

==== Emerge ====

Emerge Samba:

{{Emerge|net-fs/samba}}

=== CIFS ===

==== USE flags ====

If the full Samba package is not needed, the {{Package|net-fs/cifs-utils}} package is available:

{{USEflag|package=net-fs/cifs-utils|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|net-fs/cifs-utils}}:
|acl+Yes
|ads+Yes
|caps+Yes
|caps-ng+Yes
|creds
}}

==== Emerge ====

Emerge CIFS:

{{Emerge|cifs-utils}}

== Usage ==

=== OpenRC ===

{{RootCmd|rc-service samba start}}

{{RootCmd|rc-update add samba default}}

=== CIFS share ===

==== Mount the shared content ====

Once the client is fully configured, the shares can soon be accessed.

Create the mount point:

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /mnt/My-Disk/{Media,Shared} }}

Mount the exported folders:

{{RootCmd|mount.cifs //O2-Foobar/Media /mnt/My-Disk/Media -o guest}}

{{RootCmd|mount.cifs //O2-Foobar/Shared /mnt/My-Disk/Shared -o guest}}

To automatically mount shares on every boot, edit [[fstab|/etc/fstab]] to look like this:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
//O2-Foobar/Media  /mnt/My-Disk/Media  cifs guest
//O2-Foobar/Shared /mnt/My-Disk/Shared cifs guest
}}

{{Note|
* In the case of permission problems are encountered when trying to create files and folders on the disk, try to use <code>gid{{=}}<user's_gid>, uid{{=}}<user's_uid></code>
* Be sure to replace <code><user's_gid></code> with the user ID of choice.}}

== Troubleshooting ==

Some problems may occur when trying to mount new CIFS shares. The following sections attempt to provide resolutions to common problems.

=== Cannot resolve <server-name> ===

More specifically, the actual error:

{{RootCmd|mount.cifs ...|output=<pre>
"mount error: could not find target server. TCP name foo/bar not found. No ip
address specified and hostname not found"
</pre>}}

This can easily be fixed by editing {{Path|/etc/nsswitch}} and appending <code>wins</code> next to the <code>hosts</code> entry:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/nsswitch||1=
hosts: files dns wins
}}

If this does not work, use the NFS server's IP address instead of the O2-Foobar hostname. The <tt>nmblookup</tt> utility (provided by {{Package|net-fs/samba}}) comes in handy when trying to find the IP address of an NFS host:

{{RootCmd|nmblookup O2-Foobar}}

=== Shutdown process hangs when trying to unmount CIFS shares ===
<!-- If you make any changes to this section, please consider changing the appropriate section in [[NFS]] as well. -->

If the system shutdown hangs at 
<div class="cmd-box"><div><code> <span style="color:#54ff54">*</span> Unmounting network filesystems ...</code></div></div>
then users must make sure the CIFS shares are unmounted properly before [[udev]] tries to stop. One way to work around this is to create [[local.d]] scripts to unmount the CIFS filesystems:

{{RootCmd
|echo "umount -a -t cifs -f" > /etc/local.d/cifs.stop
|chmod a+x /etc/local.d/cifs.stop}}

=== Windows asking for passwords ===

<pre>
security = share
</pre>
