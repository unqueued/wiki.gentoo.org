'''Samba''' is a re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol, an MS Windows alternative to [[NFS]].

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
File Systems --->
    [*] Network File Systems --->
        [*] CIFS support (advanced network filesystem, SMBFS successor)--->
            [*] CIFS Statistics
                [*] Extended Statistics
            [*] CIFS Extended Attributes
                [*] CIFS POSIX Extentions
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
If you don't really want the full samba package, you can install only the {{package|net-fs/mount-cifs}} package:
{{Emerge|mount-cifs}}

== Usage ==

=== Mount the shared content ===
When your client is fully configured, you can access the shares like this:

==== Create the mount point ====
{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /mnt/My-Disk/{Media,Shared} }}

==== Mount the exported folders ====
{{RootCmd|mount.cifs //O2-Foobar/Media /mnt/My-Disk/Media -o guest}}
{{RootCmd|mount.cifs //O2-Foobar/Shared /mnt/My-Disk/Shared -o guest}}

===== Automatically mount shares on every boot =====
If you want to automatically mount your shares on every boot, then edit your [[fstab]] to look like this:
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
//O2-Foobar/Media /mnt/My-Disk/Media cifs guest
//O2-Foobar/Shared /mnt/My-Disk/Shared cifs guest
</pre>}}
{{Note|In case you get permission problems when trying to create files and folders in your disk, try to use ''gid{{=}}<your_user_gid>, uid{{=}}<your_user_uid>''.}}

== Troubleshooting ==
The following problems may pop up when trying to mount your shiny new CIFS shares:

=== Cannot resolve <server-name> ===
And more specifically, the actual error looks like this
{{RootCmd|mount.cifs ...|output=<pre>
"mount error: could not find target server. TCP name foo/bar not found. No ip
address specified and hostname not found"
</pre>}}

This can easily be fixed by editing {{Path|/etc/nsswitch}} and appending ''wins'' next to ''hosts'' entry
{{File|/etc/nsswitch||<pre>
hosts: files dns wins
</pre>}}

If this does not work, you can use the NFS server's IP address instead of the O2-Foobar hostname. You can use the '''nmblookup''' utility (provided by {{Package|net-fs/samba}}) to find out the IP address of an NFS host
{{RootCmd|nmblookup O2-Foobar}}

=== Shutdown process hangs when trying to unmount cifs shares ===
In case your system fails to shutdown or reboot properly, then you need to make sure you umount the cifs shares before [[udev]] tries to stop.

The easy way is to create a [[local.d]] script:
{{RootCmd|echo "umount -a -t cifs -f" > /etc/local.d/cifs.stop}}
