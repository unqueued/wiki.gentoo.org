[[Mount]]ing removable media, like CDs, DVDs, USB drives or memory cards, needs special handling, because most often you want a regular user to be able to mount ad-hoc an unknown device.

== Prerequisites ==
* Kernel support for your [[:Category:Storage devices|storage device]].
* Kernel support for your [[filesystem]].

== Groups ==

See https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Udisks#Groups

== MTP ==

For media using the '''MTP''' ('''M'''edia '''T'''ransfer '''P'''rotocol) protocol see the [[MTP]] article.

== USB mass storage device ==

For USB mass storage devices see the [[USB/Guide#Mounting_a_USB_Mass_Storage_device|USB article]]

== udisks ==
[[udisks]] is a daemon to manage mounting of removable media. It mounts filesystems to subfolders of {{Path|/media}}.

=== KDE ===
[[KDE]] supports udisks with its Solid framework. After plugging in the media shows up:
* in the '''device notifier''' widget
* in the start menu under '''Computer -> Places'''
* in Dolphin in the sidebar under '''Places'''
