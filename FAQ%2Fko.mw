이 자주 묻는 질문은 gentoo-dev 메일링 리스트와 프리노드 IRC에서 수집한 질문과 답변의 모음입니다.

__TOC__

=== 도입부 ===

대부분의 질답은 공식 젠투 문서 및 안내서에서 나왔음을 참고하십시오. 일반적인 질문일 뿐입니다. 젠투와 GNU/Linuxrk 어떻게 동작하는지 더 많이 알고 이해하며, 여기에서 답하지 않은 질문의 답을 얻으려면 젠투 문서 및 맨 페이지를 보십시오. 

== 시작하기 ==

=== Gentoo는 어떻게 발음하고, 무슨 뜻이죠? ===

''Gentoo''는 ''젠-투''(''Gentoo''의 ''g'' 는 ''gentle''의 ''g''처럼 부드럽게)라고 발음합니다. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_penguin 젠투 펭귄]<sup>en</sup>의 학명은 ''Pygoscelis papua''입니다. ''Gentoo''라는 이름은 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands 포클랜드 제도]의 거류민이 펭귄에게 붙인 이름입니다.

=== 젠투를 특별하게 하는건 무엇인가요? ===

젠투는 BSD port와 유사한 [[Project:Portage|포티지]]를 사용합니다. 포티지는 꾸러미 관리 시스템이며 젠투 시스템에 프로그램을 설치하고 관리하는데 있어 상당한 유연성이 있습니다.  ([[Handbook:AMD64/Working/USE/ko|USE 플래그]]를 통해) 컴파일 시간 옵션, 꾸러미 설치 이전 요약 정보, 안전한 (샌드 박싱) 설치 프로그램의 설치 제거, 시스템 프로파일, 여러 [[Handbook:AMD64/Working/Features/ko|기능]] 중  [[Handbook:AMD64/Portage/Variables/ko#.EC.84.A4.EC.A0.95_.ED.8C.8C.EC.9D.BC_.EB.B3.B4.ED.98.B8|설정 파일 보호]]기능이 있습니다.

기본적으로 젠투의 모든 시스템은 사용자의 최적화 취향에 따라 소스코드로 빌드합니다. 어떤 꾸러미가 설치되어 있든 아니든 사용자는 전반적으로 완벽한 제어를 할 수 있습니다. 젠투에는 다양한 선택의 여지를 제공하므로, 사용자는 취향에 따라 젠투를 설치할 수 있습니다. 이게 바로 젠투를 ''메타-배포판''이라 칭하는 이유입니다. 

젠투는 활발하게 개발중입니다. 전체 배포판은 매우 빠른속도의 개발 방식을 따라갑니다: 꾸러미에 대한 패치를 빠르게 메인라인 트리에 통합하고 문서를 일일 기반으로 업데이트하며, 포티지 기능을 자주 추가하고, 공식 릴리즈는 연간 두번 나옵니다.

== 설치 ==

=== -O9 -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer 최적화 옵션을 썼는데 되게 불안정해요. 어떻게 해야 하죠? ===

Do not bother using anything higher than <code>-O3</code> since it is not supported by current versions of GCC. Very aggressive optimizations sometimes cause the compiler to streamline the assembly code to the point where it does not quite do the same thing anymore. 

Please try to compile with CFLAGS <code>-O2 -march=<system_arch></code> before reporting a bug. 

=== 루트(또는 다른 사용자) 암호를 어떻게 바꿔요? ===

Use the <tt>passwd</tt> command to change the password for the user that is logged in. The root user can change user's password by issuing the command <tt>passwd username</tt>. For extra options and settings see <tt>passwd</tt>'s manual page (<tt>man passwd</tt>).

=== 일반 사용자를 어떻게 추가하죠? ===

The command <tt>useradd larry</tt> will add a user called "larry". However, this method does not give the user many of the rights needed to work properly on the system, so the following command is preferred:

{{RootCmd|useradd -m -G users,audio,wheel larry}}

This will add a user called "larry". The <code>-G</code> option adds the user to a number of groups:
* <code>users</code> which is the standard group for interactive users on the system
* <code>audio</code> which allows the user to access sound devices
* <code>wheel</code> which allows the user to execute the <tt>su</tt> command to gain root privileges (if he knows the root password)

=== 왜 사용자가 su 명령으로 루트 진입을 못하죠? ===

For security reasons, users may only <tt>su</tt> to root if they belong to the wheel group. To add a username to the wheel group, issue the following command as root: 

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> wheel}}

=== 다시 설치하지 않고도 젠투를 어떤 릴리즈에서 다른 릴리즈로 업그레이드할 수 있나요? ===

In fact, there is no difference between the various releases after they have been installed. Gentoo 1.4 and later are <code>glibc-2.3.x</code> (or higher) based. As such, running <tt>emerge --sync && emerge -uDN @world</tt> will bring the entire system up to speed with the "latest Gentoo". The differences between individual releases lie in the installation medium and pre-compiled packages. See the [[Upgrading Gentoo|Gentoo Upgrading Guide]] for more information about profiles and their role in upgrading. 

Also note that the <tt>emerge -uDN world</tt> command updates the installed packages as well as their dependencies, but not the build-time dependencies (packages needed during builds but not when the software is installed). To update those as well, add the <code>--with-bdeps=y</code> option.

=== 커널 부팅이 안되는데요 어떻게 해야 돼요? ===

It isn't obligatory to redo every step of the installation. However, investigating the kernel and all associated steps is necessary. Suppose that Gentoo is installed on {{Path|/dev/sda1}} ({{Path|/boot}}) and {{Path|/dev/sda3}} ({{Path|/}}) with {{Path|/dev/sda2}} being the swap space.

Boot from the install CD and wait until a command prompt shows up.

First mount all the partitions:

{{RootCmd|mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/gentoo
|mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/gentoo/boot
|swapon /dev/sda2
|mount -t proc none /mnt/gentoo/proc}}

Then <tt>chroot</tt> into the Gentoo environment and configure the kernel:

{{RootCmd|chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash
|env-update && source /etc/profile
|cd /usr/src/linux
|make menuconfig}}

Now (de)select anything that was (de)selected wrongly on the previous attempt, quit, and compile the kernel:

{{RootCmd|make && make modules_install}}

Now copy the bzImage file, overwriting the previous one:

{{RootCmd|cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/<kernel_name>}}

If LILO has been used as the bootloader, rerun <tt>lilo</tt> - GRUB users should skip this step:

{{RootCmd|/sbin/lilo}}

Exit the chroot and reboot the system.

{{RootCmd|exit
|umount /mnt/gentoo/proc /mnt/gentoo/boot /mnt/gentoo
|reboot}}

If, on the other hand, the problem lies with the bootloader configuration, follow the same steps, but instead of configuring and compiling the kernel, reconfigure the bootloader (recompilation of the bootloader is usually not necessary).

=== 프록시에서 인증이 필요하다고 하는데, 뭘 해야 하죠? ===

To have Portage automatically use this scheme, define it in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}: 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Setting up proxy|1=
http_proxy="http://username:password@yourproxybox.org:portnumber"
ftp_proxy="ftp://username:password@yourproxybox.org:portnumber"
RSYNC_PROXY="rsync://username:password@yourproxybox.server:portnumber"
}}

Keep in mind that the proxy server must support the <tt>CONNECT</tt> method for the rsync port(s).

=== ISO 파일은 어떻게 구워요? ===

ISO files must be burned in raw mode. This means the file should ''not'' just be placed on the CD, but interpreted as an entire CD. 

There are lots of CD burning tools available; covering them all would be a Sisyphean problem. However, describing a few popular tools never hurts: 

* With EasyCD Creator select {{Path|File}}, {{Path|Record CD from CD image}}. Then change the {{Path|Files of type}} to {{Path|ISO image file}}. Then locate the ISO file and click {{Path|Open}}. After clicking {{Path|Start recording}} the ISO image will be burned correctly onto the CD/DVD.

* With Nero Burning ROM, cancel the wizard which automatically pops up and select {{Path|Burn Image}} from the {{Path|File}} menu. Select the image to burn and click {{Path|Open}}. Now click the {{Path|Burn}} button and watch the brand new Gentoo Live CD being burnt.

* With <tt>cdrecord</tt>, simply type <tt>cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom</tt> (replace {{Path|/dev/cdrom}} with the CDROM drive's device path) followed by the path to the ISO file.

* With K3B, select {{Path|Tools}} → {{Path|CD}} → {{Path|Burn CD Image}}. Then locate the ISO file within the 'Image to Burn' area. Click {{Path|Start}} to begin the burn process.

* With Mac OS X Panther, launch <tt>Disk Utility</tt> from {{Path|Applications/Utilities}}, select {{Path|Open}} from the {{Path|Images}} menu, select the mounted disk image in the main window and select {{Path|Burn}} in the {{Path|Images}} menu.

* With Mac OS X Jaguar, launch <tt>Disk Copy</tt> from {{Path|Applications/Utilities}}, select {{Path|Burn Image}} from the {{Path|File}} menu, select the ISO and click the {{Path|Burn}} button.

=== 제 CPU에는 어떤 CD/스테이지를 써야 하나요? ===

First find out what CPU is in the system Gentoo is to be installed on (for instance a Pentium-M). Next find out what CPU type it is compatible with (instruction-wise) to find a proper match with Gentoo's CD or stages. Consulting the CPU's vendor website for this information usually works, although querying a search engine of choice is usually more efficient.

When uncertain, take a "lower" CD/stage file, for instance a i686 or even generic x86 (or the equivalent in the system's arch). This will ensure that the system will work, but may not be as fast as further optimizations. 

Please note that many more options exist than those for which Gentoo builds binary stages. Please see the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.3/gcc/i386-and-x86_002d64-Options.html#i386-and-x86_002d64-Options GCC guide] for setting the <code>-march</code> flag.

=== The Internet does not work after rebooting. What is wrong? ===

First verify that the network card is discovered properly by the kernel. Run <tt>ifconfig -a</tt> and look for network interfaces. Something such as eth0, eno1, enp2s0, enp0s8, wlan0 (in case of certain wireless network cards) should be present. Specific kernel modules may be required for the kernel to properly detect the network card. If that is the case, make sure that the required kernel modules are listed in the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/modules}} file.

If support for the system's network card  has been left out of the kernel, it will need to be reconfigured and, in some cases, recompiled. 

If the network card ''is'' found by the kernel, but the network configuration has been set to use DHCP, a DHCP client might not have been installed on the system. There are many DHCP clients available in Gentoo, a common one being <tt>dhcpcd</tt>. If necessary to get the connection to the Internet working reboot to the installation CD and <tt>emerge -a dhcpcd</tt>.

Information on how to rescue the system using the installation CD is available [[#My kernel doesn't boot, what should I do now?|here]] as well.

=== Attempting to boot Windows from GRUB or LILO only shows a black screen. What should I do? ===

This is a known problem. Windows refuses to boot when it is not installed on the first hard drive and shows a black/blank screen. To handle this, it is necessary to "fool" Windows into believing that it is installed on the first hard drive with a little tweak in the boot loader configuration. Please note that in the below example, Gentoo is installed on {{Path|/dev/sda}} (first disk) and Windows on {{Path|/dev/sdb}} (second disk). Adjust the configuration as needed:

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/grub/grub.conf|title=Example dual boot entry for Windows in grub.conf|1=
title Windows XP
     map (hd1) (hd0)
     map (hd0) (hd1)
     rootnoverify (hd1,0)
     chainloader +1
}}

{{Note|The above example is for [[GRUB|GRUB Legacy]] bootloader, not GRUB2. For information on how to dual boot Windows with GRUB2 see the [[GRUB2|GRUB2 article]].}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/lilo.conf|title=Example dual boot entry for Windows in lilo.conf|1=
other=/dev/sdb1
     label=WindowsXP
     table=/dev/sdb
     map-drive = 0x80
     to = 0x81
     map-drive = 0x81
     to = 0x80
}}

This will make Windows believe it is installed on the first hard drive and boot without problems. More information can be found in official [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/ GRUB documentation] and in <tt>man lilo.conf</tt>.

=== How do I install Gentoo using a stage1 or stage2 tarball? ===

The Gentoo Handbook only describes a Gentoo installation using a stage3 tarball. However, Gentoo still provides stage1 and stage2 tarballs. This is for development purposes (the Release Engineering team starts from a stage1 tarball to obtain a stage3) but should not be used by users: a stage3 tarball can very well be used to bootstrap the system. A working Internet connection is a requirement. 

Bootstrapping means building the toolchain (the C library and compiler) for the system after which all core system packages are installed. To bootstrap the system, perform a stage3 installation. Before starting the chapter on ''Configuring the Kernel'', it might be necessary to modify the {{Path|bootstrap.sh}} script to match personal requirements:

{{RootCmd|cd /usr/portage/scripts
|vi bootstrap.sh}}

수정이 끝나면 스크립트를 실행하십시오.

{{RootCmd|./bootstrap.sh}}

그 다음 모든 핵심 시스템 꾸러미를 새로 빌드한 툴체인으로 다시 빌드하십시오. 스테이지 3 타르볼을 제공했으므로 다시 빌드해야합니다: 

{{RootCmd|emerge -e system}}

Now continue with ''Configuring the Kernel''.

== Package management ==

=== 꾸러미는 어떤 모양새로 저장하죠? ===

Packages are not "stored" per se. Instead, Gentoo provides a set of scripts which can resolve dependencies, fetch source code, and compile a version of the package tailored to the user his needs. Generally Gentoo only builds binaries for releases and snapshots. The [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/index.html Gentoo Developer Manual] covers the contents of an ebuild script in detail. 

For full ISO releases, a full suite of binary packages will be created using an enhanced <code>.tbz2</code> format, which is {{Path|.tar.bz2}} compatible with meta-information attached to the end of the file. These can be used to install a working (though not fully optimized) version of the package quickly and efficiently.

It is possible to create RPMs (Red Hat package manager files) using Gentoo's Portage, but it is not currently possible to use already existing RPMs to install packages.

=== ./configure 과정을 제가 실행하고 싶은데, 할 수 있나요? ===

Yes, but it is not trivial, nor is it recommended. Since the method to do this requires a good understanding of Portage internals and commands, it is instead recommended that the ebuild is patched to do whatever it is that the user wants and place it in a Portage overlay (that is why overlays exist). This is ''much'' better for maintainability, and usually easier. See the [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/index.html Gentoo Developer Manual] for more information.

=== What if rsync does not work for me? ===

When behind a firewall that does not permit rsync traffic through port 873, the <tt>emerge-webrsync</tt> command can be used to fetch and install a Portage snapshot through regular HTTP. See [[#My proxy requires authentication, what do I have to do?|this section]] for information on downloading source files and Portage snapshots via a proxy.

=== I have a slow (or no) Internet connection at home. Can I download sources somewhere else and add them to my system? ===

Definitely. Run <tt>emerge --pretend package/atom</tt> to see what programs are going to be installed. To find out the sources for those packages and where to download the sources from, run <tt>emerge -fp package/atom</tt>. Download sources and bring them on any media home. Put the sources into the {{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles/}} folder and then simply run <tt>emerge package/atom</tt>. Be warned: this can be a ''very'' tedious process.

=== Source tarballs are collecting in /usr/portage/distfiles/. Is it safe to delete these files? ===

Deleting these files will have no negative impact on day-to-day performance. However, it might be wise to keep the most recent version of the files; often several ebuilds will be released for the same version of a specific piece of software. If the archive is deleted and the software is upgraded or rebuilt it will be necessary to download them from the Internet again. 

Use the <tt>[[eclean]]</tt> script from {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} to manage the contents of {{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles/}} and a few other locations. Please read <tt>man eclean</tt> to learn more about its usage, as well as the [[Gentoolkit|Gentoolkit article]].

=== What is in /var/tmp/portage? Is it safe to delete the files and directories in /var/tmp/portage? ===

During compilation, Gentoo saves the sources of the package in {{Path|/var/tmp/portage}}. These files and folder are usually deleted upon a successful merge, but this sometimes fails. It is safe to clean out all contents of this directory ''if'' the <tt>emerge</tt> command is not running. Be sure to always <tt>pgrep emerge</tt> before cleaning out this directory.

== 사용법 ==

=== How do I set up an International Keyboard Layout? ===

Edit the <code>keymap</code> variable in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/keymaps}}. To have console working correctly with extended characters in the keymap, it might be necessary to set up the variables <code>consolefont</code> and <code>consoletransation</code> in the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/consolefont}} file (for further information on localizing the environment, refer to the [[Localization/Guide|localization guide]]). Then, issue a <tt>reboot</tt>, or restart the keymaps and consolefont scripts: 

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/keymaps restart
|/etc/init.d/consolefont restart}}

=== DNS name resolution works for root only ===

{{Path|/etc/resolv.conf}} has the wrong permissions; <tt>chmod</tt> it as follows: 

{{RootCmd|chmod 0644 /etc/resolv.conf}}

=== Why can't my user use their own crontab? ===

Add that user to the cron group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> cron}}

=== How do I get numlock to start on boot? ===

The following command will add the numlock service to the default runlevel, enabling numlock at boot:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add numlock default
|/etc/init.d/numlock start}}

Each GUI provides different tools for this sort of thing; please check the help section or online manuals for the GUI of choice for further assistance.

=== 로그아웃할 때 터미널을 지우는 방법은요? ===

To have the terminal cleared, add the <tt>clear</tt> command to the user's {{Path|~/.bash_logout}} script: 

{{Cmd|echo clear >> ~/.bash_logout}}

To have this happen automatically when adding a new user, do the same for the {{Path|/etc/skel/.bash_logout}} file: 

{{RootCmd|echo clear >> /etc/skel/.bash_logout}}

== 관리 ==

=== ReiserFS and filesystem corruption issues - how to fix them, etc ===

If the ReiserFS partition is corrupt, try booting the Gentoo Install CD and run <tt>reiserfsck --rebuild-tree</tt> on the corrupted filesystem. This should make the filesystem consistent again, although there may be some lost files or directories due to the corruption. 

== 개발 ==

=== 어디서 버그를 보고할 수 있죠? ===

Use the [https://bugs.gentoo.org Bugzilla] site to report bugs. Visit #gentoo on the Freenode IRC network and ask around if it is unclear whether an issue is really a bug or not.

=== 새 릴리즈는 얼마나 자주 만드나요? ===

Gentoo's packages are usually updated shortly after the upstream authors release new code. As for when Gentoo itself makes new stage/profile/ISO releases, check the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng Release Engineering Project] page. New releases are announced on the [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml gentoo-announce] mailing list. See [[#Can I upgrade Gentoo from one release to another without reinstalling?|this section]] for more information.

=== 스피커 삑소리가 미친듯이 나요. 어떻게 콘솔 삑소리를 끄죠? ===

Console beeps can be turned off using setterm, like this: 

{{RootCmd|setterm -blength 0}}

To turn off the console beeps on boot, put the following command in the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/local.start}} file. However, this only disables beeps for the current terminal. To disable beeps for other terminals, pipe the command output to the target terminal, like this: 

{{RootCmd|setterm -blength 0 > /dev/vc/1}}

Replace {{Path|/dev/vc/1}} with the terminal for which console beeps need to be disabled.

== 자료 ==

=== Where can I find more information about Gentoo Linux? ===

Much of the official Gentoo documentation can be found here on the Wiki. Some older documentation is still available at [http://wwwold.gentoo.org/doc/en/ http://wwwold.gentoo.org/doc/en/].

== 젠투 리눅스 CD를 살 수 있나요? ==

Users who are not able to download and burn installation CDs personally might find one through one of our licensed stores. However, most stores have dropped offering CDs and DVDs as these installation media quickly become obsolete. 

The licensed stores are listed on the [https://www.gentoo.org/inside-gentoo/stores/ stores page].

=== This FAQ has not answered my question. What do I do now? ===

A good first step is to browse through the relevant [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/index.xml documentation], failing that, the various Gentoo Linux mailing lists listed on [https://www.google.com/ Google]. To search through the Gentoo mailing lists, enter "site:lists.gentoo.org foo" to search for "foo". If all else fails, or to just hang out with Gentoo folks, visit us on the #gentoo Freenode IRC channel.
