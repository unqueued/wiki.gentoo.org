== CPU frequency scaling ==

CPU周波数スケーリングは、プロセッサの周波数を自動的に電力を節約するために、チップの発熱量を低減するために、「オンザフライ」で調整することができる技術です。

=== Installation ===

==== BIOS ====

Some functions can be enabled or disabled in the [[BIOS]]. Check that the following are enabled:
* "Processor C1E support"
* "Enhanced Speedstep (EIST)"

==== Kernel ====

Activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling CPU power management options|1=
Power management and ACPI options  --->
     [*] ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support  --->
         <*>   Processor
     CPU Frequency scaling  --->
         [*] CPU Frequency scaling
             Default CPUFreq governor (ondemand)  --->
                 Select a default governor; see below table
                 Default is ondemand
             *** CPU frequency scaling drivers ***
                 Select a driver; see below table
}}

A governor is needed, which is responsible for changing the frequency based on its profile:

| 'performance' governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_performance}}
| Sets the frequency statically to the highest available CPU frequency.
| For Intel core processors, this should be selected as default. <ref>Dominik Brodowski.

|-
| 'powersave' governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_powersave}}
| Sets the frequency statically to the lowest available CPU frequency.
| Can't be set as default.
|-
| 'userspace' governor for userspace frequency scaling
| {{ta|cpufreq_userspace}}
| To set the CPU frequency manually or when a userspace program shall be able to set the CPU dynamically.
|
|-
| 'ondemand' cpufreq policy governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_ondemand}} 
| Does a periodic polling and changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.
| For processors other than Intel core, this should be selected as default.
|-
| 'conservative' cpufreq governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_conservative}}
| Similar to ondemand. The frequency is gracefully increased and decreased rather than jumping to 100% when speed is required.

== Ticks ==

The processor saves the most energy when the processor stays longer in power savings mode, so reduce the amount of ticks that wakes the processor up. Details about the available tickless modes can be found in the [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/timers/NO_HZ.txt kernel documentation].

=== Installation ===

==== BIOS ====

Some functions can be enabled or disabled in the [[BIOS]]. Check that the following are enabled:
* "HPET"
* "Multimedia timer"

==== Kernel ====

Activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling tick optimizing functions in the kernel|1=
Processor type and features  --->
   [*] Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks)
   [*] High Resolution Timer Support
   [*] HPET Timer Support
}}

{{Note|These options now appear to be under "General setup" -> "Timers subsystem".}}

== PowerTOP ==

[[PowerTOP]] is a utility designed to measure, explain and minimize a computer's electrical power consumption.

When it is run, it sorts the running processes in order of how often they cause the processor to wake up. For details on installation, configuration and usage see the separate [[PowerTOP]] article.

== Hprofile ==

It is possible to change the active CPU governor using a simple command:

{{RootCmd|for c in $(ls -d /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*); do
echo ondemand >$c/cpufreq/scaling_governor; done}}

Read {{Path|/etc/local.d/README}} to learn how to execute this command on startup.

Applications such as {{Package|sys-power/cpupower}} do little more than the above but with some interface on top of it. However, having to run certain commands as root depending on the system usage is not efficient for most users. It is better to automate some of the decisions of governing CPU frequency. For instance, when not wired to AC power, most users would like to have the system in a power saving mode.

This is where [[Hprofile]] comes into play. Please refer to its article for more information and configuration.
