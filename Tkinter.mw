Tkinter (tkinter in Python 3.x) claims to be "most portable GUI toolkit for Python"[http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/] and is Python's "de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package"[https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter]. Although there are several other graphical toolkits for Python, Tkinter is the one most often used.

== Setup ==
{{USEflag|package=dev-lang/tk
|debug
|test
|threads
|truetype
|xscreensaver
}}

== Installation ==
On Gentoo, getting Tkinter can be accomplished by directly emerging the package and/or by modifying your system's use flags. Since Tkinter is build on [http://wiki.tcl.tk/ tcl] and tk, both of which are closely related to Python, you can get the package by updating your system's global use flags and re-emerging Python. Using this method of installation will pull the packages needed to successfully run Tkinter.

First, modify your make.conf:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Add tc to the system's global USE flags:|
<pre>USE="tk"</pre>
}}

Next, re-emerge Python using this command:
{{RootCmd|emerge -N python}}

That's it! You've installed Tkinter!

== Using tk ==

When attempting to use Tkinter in your Python code, depending on the version(s) of Python are currently installed on your system, you'll have to import Tkinter in different ways:

*Use the <code>import Tkinter</code> if using Python 2.x.
*Use the <code>import tkinter</code> (note the lower case T) if using Python 3.x.
