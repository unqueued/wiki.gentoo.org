Tkinter (tkinter in Python 3.x) claims to be [[Article description::"most portable GUI toolkit for Python"[http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/] and is Python's "de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package"[https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter].]] Although there are several other graphical toolkits for Python, Tkinter is the one most often used in GUI development with Python.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=dev-lang/tk}}

=== make.conf ===

On Gentoo, getting Tkinter can be accomplished by directly emerging the package and/or by modifying your system's use flags. Since Tkinter is build on [http://wiki.tcl.tk/ tcl] and tk, both of which are closely related to Python, you can get the package by updating your system's global use flags and re-emerging Python. Using this method of installation will pull the packages needed to successfully run Tkinter.

First, modify make.conf:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Add tc to the system's global USE flags:|lang=bash|1=
USE="tk"
}}

=== Emerge ===

Finally, re-emerge Python using this command:

{{emerge|params+=--oneshot --newuse|$(qlist -ICSe dev-lang/python)}}

That is it! Tkinter should now be installed.

== Usage ==

When attempting to use Tkinter in Python code, depending on the version(s) of Python are currently installed on the system, import Tkinter might need performed in different ways:

* When using Python 2.x.: use <code>import Tkinter</code>
* using Python 3.x: use <code>import tkinter</code> (note the lower case ''T'').
