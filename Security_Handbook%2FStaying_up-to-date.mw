<includeonly>== Keeping up-to-date ==</includeonly>
Once you have successfully installed your system and ensured a good level of security you are not done. Security is an ongoing process; the vast majority of intrusions result from known vulnerabilities in unpatched systems. Keeping your system up-to-date is the single most valuable step you can take to greater security.

If you have a recent version of Portage installed, you can first sync the Portage tree with {{c|emerge --sync}} and then issue the command {{c|glsa-check --list}} to check if your system is up to date security-wise. {{c|glsa-check}} is part of {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}.

{{RootCmd|glsa-check -l|output=<pre>
[A] means this GLSA was marked as applied (injected),
[U] means the system is not affected and
[N] indicates that the system might be affected.

200406-03 [N] sitecopy: Multiple vulnerabilities in included libneon ( net-misc/sitecopy )
200406-04 [U] Mailman: Member password disclosure vulnerability ( net-mail/mailman )
.......
</pre>}}

{{Warning|The glsa-check is still experimental, so if security really is your top priority it would be wise to double check the list with other sources.}}

All lines with a <code>[A]</code> and <code>[U]</code> can be almost safely ignored as the system is not affected by this GLSA.

{{Important|Please note that the usual {{c|emerge -vpuD @world}} will not pick up all package updates. You need to use {{c|glsa-check}} if you want to make sure all GLSAs are fixed on the system.}}

Check all GLSAs:

{{RootCmd|glsa-check -t all|output=<pre>
This system is affected by the following GLSA:
200504-06
200510-08
200506-14
200501-35
200508-12
200507-16
</pre>}}

See what packages would be emerged:

{{RootCmd|glsa-check -p $(glsa-check -t all)|output=<pre>
Checking GLSA 200504-06
The following updates will be performed for this GLSA:
     app-arch/sharutils-4.2.1-r11 (4.2.1-r10)

     **********************************************************************

     Checking GLSA 200510-08
     The following updates will be performed for this GLSA:
          media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.0-r5 (1.1.0-r4)
</pre>}}

Apply required fixes:

{{RootCmd|glsa-check -f $(glsa-check -t all)}}

If you have upgraded a running service, you should not forget to restart it.

Keeping the [[Kernel/Upgrade|kernel up-to-date]] is also recommended.

If you want an email each time a GLSA is released subscribe to the [https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-announce/ gentoo-announce mailing list]. Instructions for joining it and many other great mailing lists can be found in the [https://www.gentoo.org/get-involved/mailing-lists/all-lists.html Gentoo mailing lists].

Another great security resource is the [http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1 Bugtraq mailing list].
