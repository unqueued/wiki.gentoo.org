On Saturday 30 January 2016 and Sunday 31 January 2016, the [http://fosdem.org/2016/ Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting FOSDEM 2016] will take place in Brussels, Belgium.

Naturally a Gentoo crowd will be there; this page is intended to collect public information about our presence and help organizing stuff.

== Coordination ==

Please use [[FOSDEM 2016/Planning]] to coordinate things.

== Gentoo stand ==

Our table will be at [https://fosdem.org/2016/stands/ K (level 1, group B)]. Feel free to come by.

The following is an hour-by-hour schedule of who is running the stand. The plan is to have always two devs present, with overlapping two-hour slots (i.e., 10h-12h, 12h-14h, ... and 9h-11h, 11h-13h, 13h-15h, ...) (At start and end there are shorter slots, but these obviously also involve build-up and teardown.)
