'''Django''' is a web application framework built on python.

==install==
{{emerge|django}}

===Sample project===
Make first project:
{{Cmd|django-admin startproject mysite}}
To start development server navigate to the project directory and run:
{{Cmd|python manage.py runserver}}
it will use the 8000 port by default. You can change it by adding a chosen port number after the runserver command. Do not use this server for production only for development.
===apache modules===
If you plan on using apache for production also emerge mod_wsgi

{{emerge|mod_wsgi}}

To enable WSGI module:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/apache2|title=Enabling the WSGI module|lang=bash|1=
APACHE2_OPTS="... -D WSGI"
}}

==setup==
as of this writing 03:02, 25 January 2014 (UTC) dev-python/django-1.4.8 only supports up to python 2.7 so we must select and develop under python 2.7
{{RootCmd|eselect python set python2.7}}

to test that python can import django
{{Cmd|python -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"}}

=== moving on ===
At this point you can continue on from here.
