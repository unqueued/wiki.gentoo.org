[http://upc.lbl.gov/ '''UPC'''] is an extension of the C programming language designed for high performance computing on large-scale parallel machines. There is a number of realizations of UPC. Currently only Berkeley realization is available through layman (in science overlay).

== Installation of the Berkeley runtime/driver ==
Berkeley UPC realization is divided into runtime/driver and UPC-to-C translator. User operates with runtime/driver. If there is no UPC-to-C translator installed localy runtime/driver will use online translator provided by upstream.

First you need to add science overlay:
{{RootCmd|layman -a science}}

{{USEflag
|mpi
|mpi-compat+++Enable interoperability with MPI
|pshm+++Build UPC Runtime/GASNet with Process-SHared Memory enabled
|segment-fast+yes++Select GASNet's FAST segments (default), for the fastest remote access with a possible cost in max shared memory size
|segment-large+++Select GASNet's LARGE segments, for the largest possible shared memory size, at a possible cost in remote access time
|single+yes++Support running over smp loopback (no network)
|sptr-packed+yes++Use the more efficient 'packed' shared pointer representation
|sptr-struct+++Use the 'struct' shared pointer representation
|sptr-symmetric+++Enable 'symmetric' pointer variant where available (64-bit smp and shmem)
|udp+yes++Support running over UDP
}}

There is much more configuration options available for you. To see them visit Berkeley UPC home page and especially read [http://upc.lbl.gov/download/dist/INSTALL.TXT]. All these options can be enabled by using EXTRA_ECONF variable. For example, if you want to use Quadrics/elan network conduit emerge the package as
{{RootCmd|EXTRA_ECONF{{=}}'--enable-elan' emerge -va dev-lang/berkeley_upc}}
Some network conduits may need setting other environment variables to be discovered correctly during configure. Consult with documentation.

Also you can use [[package.env]] to set EXTRA_ECONF and other necessary variables.

Portable network conduits are available through setting appropriate USE flags (mpi, single, udp).

If you use portage.env or do not need to set additional options emerge this package just with
{{Emerge|dev-lang/berkeley_upc}}

== Installation of the UPC-to-C translator ==
Install it with
{{Emerge|dev-lang/berkeley_upc_translator}}
After installation you will need to point driver/runtime to the translator. You can do it while compiling passing -translator=/usr/libexec/berkeley_upc_translator-VERSION/targ option to the upcc. Where VERSION is the version of dev-lang/berkeley_upc_translator.

Also you can edit translator option in the file /usr/libexec/berkeley_upc-VERSION/CONFIGURATION/etc/upcc.conf. VERSION here is the version of dev-lang/berkeley_upc package and CONFIGURATION is the configuration you use (opt by default). To see what configurations are consult with UPC documentation about multiconf.
