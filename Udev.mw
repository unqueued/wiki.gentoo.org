The udev application manages the device nodes in {{Path|/dev}}. It is triggered by the Linux kernel through uevents and uses a rule-based configuration to decide what actions to undertake when such a uevent has been fired.

== Using udev ==

=== Requirements ===

Most Gentoo Linux systems use udev for the device node management. As such, the requirements for udev are (most of the time) already fulfilled:

* A Linux kernel 2.6.32 or higher
* The <code>CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER</code> kernel setting

=== Installing udev ===

The {{Package|sys-fs/udev}} package is part of most Gentoo Linux profiles' default set (called the ''system'' set), so should be installed automatically when you install Gentoo Linux.

However, if this isn't the case, you can always install it by simply emerging it.

{{Emerge|sys-fs/udev}}

Next, validate that the ''udev'' init script is automatically started at boot (through the sysinit runlevel):

{{RootCmd|rc-config show sysinit|output=<pre>Status of init scripts in runlevel "sysinit"
  devfs                     [started]
  dmesg                     [started]
  udev                      [started]</pre>}}

Also check if the ''udev-postmount'' init script is started through the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-config show default|output=<pre>Status of init scripts in runlevel "default"
  dnsmasq                   [started]
  local                     [started]
  net.eth1                  [started]
  netmount                  [started]
  sshd                      [started]
  udev-postmount            [started]
  vixie-cron                [started]</pre>}}
