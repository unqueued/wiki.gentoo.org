exFAT ('''Ex'''tended '''F'''ile '''A'''llocation '''T'''able), a Microsoft file system optimized for flash memory storage such as USB sticks, is available to Gentoo Linux systems through a [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]] module.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Make sure support for Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is enabled in the kernel:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable support for CONFIG_FUSE_FS|1=
File systems  --->
   <*> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support
}}

=== Emerge ===

Install the FUSE exfat package:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/fuse-exfat}}

For filesystem creation and manipulation beyond that of the {{c|mount}} command it is necessary to install the {{Package|sys-fs/exfat-utils}} package:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/exfat-utils}}

== Usage ==

=== Formatowanie ===

To create an exFAT file system, use {{c|mkfs.exfat}} (or the {{c|mkexfatfs}} command, which is synonymous):

{{RootCmd|mkfs.exfat|output=<pre>
mkexfatfs 1.2.1
Usage: mkfs.exfat [-i volume-id] [-n label] [-p partition-first-sector] [-s sectors-per-cluster] [-V] <device>
</pre>}}

For instance, to create it on a removable device present at {{Path|/dev/sde1}} while assigning "Flash" as the file system label:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.exfat -n Flash /dev/sde1}}

=== Mounting ===

The file system can then be mounted using the {{c|mount.exfat-fuse}} command:

{{RootCmd|mount.exfat-fuse|output=<pre>
FUSE exfat 1.0.1
Usage: mount.exfat-fuse [-d] [-o options] [-v] <device> <dir>
</pre>}}

For instance, to mount the file system created in the above example:

{{RootCmd|mount.exfat-fuse /dev/sde1 /mnt/flash}}

To unmount, simply use the {{c|umount}} command:

{{RootCmd|umount /mnt/flash}}

=== Integrity checking ===

To check the integrity of an exFAT filesystem, use {{c|fsck.exfat}}:

{{RootCmd|fsck.exfat /dev/sde1}}
