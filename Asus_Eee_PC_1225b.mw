== Backlight support ==

Brightness LCD may changed by Fn+F5/Fn+F6. To support it you must config kernel

{{KernelBox|title=Backlight|1=

}}

This options also add other functional of your laptop.

== USB 3.0 support ==

USB 3.0 provides by ASMedia ASM1042 SuperSpeed Controller. Gentoo sources have drivers for it

}}

{{Note|It nessecery, that xHCI HCD support will be as module. Else USB3 ports will doesn't work!}}

}}

You can compile ethernet driver as module, then you must check loading this module.

== Graphics with open-source radeon drivers ==

All the necessary firmware is provided with {{Package|x11-drivers/radeon-ucode}} package (it is easy to emerge within a chrooted environment): 

{{Emerge|
radeon-ucode
}}

Kernel parameters are well described in [[Radeon#Installation|the article about Radeon]]. However the choice of firmware isn't that obvious. As it is supposed [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-907980.html here], APU is usually detected as PALM, while in fact it is closer to SUMO. The only way out is to compile them both into kernel: 

{{KernelBox|title=Radeon drivers|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    Generic Driver Options  --->
        -*- Userspace firmware loading support
        [*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
            (radeon/PALM_me.bin radeon/PALM_pfp.bin radeon/SUMO_me.bin radeon/SUMO_pfp.bin radeon_SUMO_rlc.bin)
            (/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
}}

This lets kernel modesetting work properly.

=== Hardware acceleration video ===

Laptop has GPU Radeon HD6320. This card support some codecs for hardware acceleration:

* MPEG1
* MPEG2
* H264
* VC1
* MPEG4

It's means that your may use GPU for decoding several video and havn't 100% load CPU. 

For support hardware acceleration you must edit your install libs and player wich support VDPAU technology. Enabling USE flag <code>vdpau</code> and update world.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="... vdpau ..."
}}

Now you can manually setup the name of back-end driver with help of VDPAU_DRIVER environment variable. 
To do that you need to add the following line to ~/.bashrc file (provided that Bash is the default shell of a user who is going to run graphical environment).

{{FileBox|filename=~/.bashrc|title=Loged as a user who run graphical interface|lang=bash
|1=export VDPAU_DRIVER=r600
}}

After installation you can check vdpauinfo for get info

{{Cmd
|vdpauinfo
}}

{{CodeBox|title=output vdpauinfo|

VDPAU support:

* [[Adobe Flash]]
* [[Mpv]]
* SMplayer
* Gnome-mplayer
* [[VLC]]

==== VLC player ====

VLC have support vdpau. To use it you must enable USE flag <code>vdpau</code>. If you enable it to <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code>, it not necessary.

In VLC go to settings <code>(Ctrl+P) --> Input / Codecs --> Hardware-accelerated decoding</code> choose <code>VDPAU video decoder</code>

When VLC play movie with hardware acceleration load CPU is 30-40%.

== Audio ==
=== ALSA configuration ===

{{KernelBox|title=Alsa configuration|1=
Device Drivers  --->
  Sound card support  --->
    <*> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
      [*] PCI sound devices --->
        <*> Intel HD Audio --->
          [*] Build Realtek HD-audio codec support
          [*] Build HDMI/DisplayPort HD-audio codec support
}}

A good way to manage ALSA is to emerge alsa-utils: 

{{Emerge
|alsa-utils
}}

To start alsa at boot time type: 

{{RootCmd
|rc-update add alsasound boot
}}

There is a problem that actually ALSA often sees two sound cards: HD-Audio Generic (that is a kind of a virtual device, i.e. it doesn't actually play music) and the required HDA ATI SB. The simplest way to check it is to launch

{{Cmd|aplay -l|output=<pre>
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: Generic [HD-Audio Generic], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: SB [HDA ATI SB], device 0: ALC269VB Analog [ALC269VB Analog]
  Suvdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
</pre>}}

If HD-Audio Generic is the first number, it might be the default card. If it is the case, than you're likely to have no sound unless the default card is switched from 0 to 1. 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/asound.conf|1=
defaults.ctl.card 1
defaults.pcm.card 1
defaults.timer.card 1
}}

== Memory Card Reader ==

Card reader is provided by Alcor Micro.

        <*>   MMC block device driver
        [*]     Use bounce buffer for simple hosts
}}

== Webcam ==

Webcam is supported with standart UVC

{{KernelBox|title=Webcam Support|
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Multimedia support  ---> 
        [*] Media USB Adapters  ---> 
            <*> USB Video Class (UVC) 
}}

== Tips and tricks ==

If on your laptop sometimes keyboard and touchpad don't work add some parameters to kernel

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default/grub|1=
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="i8042.nomux i8042.reset"
}}

Then rebuild grub config

{{RootCmd
|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
}}

After that reboot your system.
