== Graphics with open-source radeon drivers ==

All the necessary firmware is provided with x11-drivers/radeon-ucode package (it is easy to emerge within a chrooted environment): 

{{Emerge|radeon-ucode}}

Kernel parameters are well described in [[Radeon#Installation|the article about Radeon]]. However the choice of firmware isn't that obvious. As it is supposed [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-907980-start-0.html here], APU is usually detected as PALM, while in fact it is closer to SUMO. The only way out is to compile them both into kernel: 

{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Generic Driver Options  --->
        -*- Userspace firmware loading support
        [*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
            (radeon/PALM_me.bin radeon/PALM_pfp.bin radeon/SUMO_me.bin radeon/SUMO_pfp.bin radeon_SUMO_rlc.bin)
            (/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
</pre>}}

This lets kernel modesetting work properly.
