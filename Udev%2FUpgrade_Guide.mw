{{Warning|'''Be careful when upgrading udev''', you will need to consider the changes listed below; ignoring them can ''break'' your system!}}

== udev 197 ==

The following special attention is required:

* '''CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y''' must be set in the kernel, it is wise to set '''CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y''' as well to avoid early boot hangs.

* If there is a /dev line in /etc/fstab, it must have the devtmpfs filesystem type or it will conflict with the above options.

* Remove udev-postmount from any runlevels, it is not necessary.

* If you are using /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules, read [[http://bugs.gentoo.org/453494 bug #453494]]; this won't be a problem if you use [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames Predictable Network Interface Names]].

* Since this version, support for older kernels than 2.6.39 is dropped, if you still use such a kernel and can't upgrade consider to use the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eudev eudev] fork.

Upgrading to the latest gentoo-sources version is also recommended.

For more details, read the full news article '''/usr/portage/metadata/news/2013-01-23-udev-upgrade/2013-01-23-udev-upgrade.en.txt''' and the post install output of emerging udev.

== udev 181 ==
Since this version udev depends on files in {{Path|/usr}}. If you have {{Path|/usr}} on a separate partition, you must boot your system with an [[initramfs]] which pre-mounts {{Path|/usr}}.

There are many tools to create such a initramfs:
* [[genkernel]]
* [[Dracut]]
* See the [[initramfs]] article for more solutions

For more details, see http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/separate-usr-is-broken and the post install output of emerging udev.
