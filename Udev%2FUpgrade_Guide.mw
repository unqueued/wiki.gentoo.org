{{Warning|'''Be careful when upgrading udev''', you will need to consider the changes listed below; ignoring them can ''break'' your system!}}

== udev 197 ==

The following special attention is required:

* '''CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y''' must be set in the kernel.

* If there is a /dev line in /etc/fstab, it must have the devtmpfs filesystem type or it will conflict with the above options.

* Remove udev-postmount from any runlevels, it is not necessary.

* If you are using /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules, read [[http://bugs.gentoo.org/453494 bug #453494]]; this won't be a problem if you use [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames Predictable Network Interface Names]].

* Since this version, support for older kernels than 2.6.32 is dropped, if you still use such a kernel and can't upgrade consider to use the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eudev eudev] fork. The 9999 version needs 2.6.39.

Upgrading to the latest gentoo-sources version is also recommended.
