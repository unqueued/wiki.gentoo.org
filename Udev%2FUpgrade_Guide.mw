This page only lists changes, which you need to consider before updating or will break your system.

== udev 181 ==
Since this version udev depends on files in {{Path|/usr}}. If you have {{Path|/usr}} on a separate partition, you must boot your system with an [[initramfs]] which pre-mounts {{Path|/usr}}.

There are many tools to create such a initramfs:
* [[genkernel]]
* [[Dracut]]
* See the [[initramfs]] article for more solutions
