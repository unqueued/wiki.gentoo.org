{{Warning|'''Be careful when upgrading udev''', you will need to consider the changes listed below; ignoring them can ''break'' your system!}}

== udev 200 ==

The following special attention is required:

* '''CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y''' must be set in the kernel.

* If there is a /dev line in /etc/fstab, it must have the devtmpfs filesystem type or it will conflict with the above options.

* Remove udev-postmount from any runlevels, it is not necessary.

* If you are using /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules, read [[http://bugs.gentoo.org/453494 bug #453494]]; this won't be a problem if you use [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames Predictable Network Interface Names]].

* If you don't have /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-name-slot.rules as empty file with only comments inside of it, or if it isn't a symlink to /dev/null, or if you didn't disable with kernel commandline
net.ifnames= you will get the new [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames Predictable Network Interface Names]] by default.

* Since this version, support for older kernels than 2.6.32 is dropped. The 9999 version needs 2.6.39 or higher.

* If you use Linux 3.8 or higher you should be able to disable USE="firmware-loader" and let kernel do the loading instead. However, you can still use USE="firmware-loader" on newer kernels too.

* sys-apps/biosdevname is no longer necessary if you use the [[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames Predictable Network Interface Names]]
