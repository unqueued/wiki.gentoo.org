|Service to calculate path to upgrade old Gentoo systems|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
The idea behind this potential GSoC project is to come up with a remote service (no webpages!) to estimate/calculate what the path of upgrade would be for an old Gentoo installation. It is a known fact that once a Gentoo system is old enough, it can be problematic (or really difficult) to get it running on newer '''@system''' packages and profiles. This project is made of various parts, such as an DSL for encoding the upgrade path (result of the calculation), coding the actual remote service, coding the algorihtms for the estimation of the upgrade path, etc.
