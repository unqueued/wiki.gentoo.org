uMurmur is a minimalistic server for Mumble designed to run on embedded systems (DD-WRT or OpenWRT) or older PC hardware. It does not include the QT framework, which makes it a much smaller package and lighter on system resources.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=media-sound/umurmur}}

=== Emerge ===

Install uMurmur via:

{{Emerge|media-sound/umurmur}}

== Configuration ==

For the most up to date details on configuration visit the [https://github.com/umurmur/umurmur/wiki/Configuration configuration article] on uMurmur's GitHub page.

In short, configuration is as follows.

=== Files ===

* {{Path|/etc/conf.d/umurmurd}} - File that controls what options are passed to the {{c|umurmurd}} daemon upon starting or restarting.
* {{Path|/etc/umurmur/umurmur.conf}} - Primary configuration file. Used to set channel names, IP addresses, group names, password, etc.

Modify the primary configuration file as desired. Be sure to set a password if the service should be private:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/umurmur/umurmur.conf|1=
password = "mysecretpassword";
}}

=== Services ===

To have the daemon start each time the system boots add it to the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add umurmurd default}}

To restart the service:

{{RootCmd|rc-service umurmurd restart}}

==== Systemd ====

For systemd users, run the following command to start the daemon:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start umurmurd.service}}
