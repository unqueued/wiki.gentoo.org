'''UML (User Mode Linux)''' is one of the virtualization solutions provided by the Linux community. Guest kernels are regular ELF applications on a Linux system and, once invoked, launch a virtual guest as a single user process on the host. Support for UML has been integrated in the Linux kernel from version 2.6 onwards.
