'''WordPress''' is a blog application content management system.

== Preinstall ==
{{Emerge|apache mysql php}}

Edit /etc/conf.d/apache and add -D PHP5 to APACHE2_OPTS

== Install ==
First unmask {{Package|www-apps/wordpress}}:
{{RootCmd|echo "www-apps/wordpress" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}

Then install wordpress:
{{Emerge|wordpress}}

Fix permissions to enable uploading content such as banners:
{{RootCmd|chown apache:apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content}}

=== MySQL ===
Create a database for WordPress to interact with.

{{RootCmd
|mysql -u root -p
|output=<pre>
mysql> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `wordpress` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET `utf8` COLLATE `utf8_unicode_ci`;
mysql> CREATE USER 'wordpress'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'changeme';
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER ON `wordpress`.* TO 'wordpress'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'changeme';
mysql> \q
</pre>}}

Configure WordPress to interact with the database created.  (generate goodies for this file with https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/)
{{RootCmd|nano /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress/wp-config.php}}

Database and database user are "wordpress" and passwords are what you set in your mysql database generation step. (changeme fields)

== 5 minute installer ==
Point your browser @ http://localhost/wordpress/

Name your website, and make a default administrator password.

== Administration & Use ==
Administer your WordPress @ http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/

Your shiny new blog is located @ http://localhost/wordpress/

=== Plugins & Themes ===

Wordpress is a bit of a permissions nightmare.  Themes and plugins will ask for ftp access due to permission problems.  For now I [[User:666threesixes666|666threesixes666]] ([[User talk:666threesixes666|talk]]) am getting around it by.

{{RootCmd|chown -R apache:apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress/wp-admin/}}
{{RootCmd|chown -R apache:apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress/wp-includes/}}
{{RootCmd|chown -R apache:apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/}}

This clearly is breaking the security of the webapp.  To restore security once all is set how you want it.

{{RootCmd|chown -R root:root /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress}}
