'''WordPress''' is a blog application content management system.

== Preinstall ==
The following applications will need to be installed in order for WordPress to have everything that's needed to work properly.
{{Emerge|apache mysql php}}

To add PHP support into apache, you must follow the directions in the main [[Apache]] article.

== Install ==
First unmask {{Package|www-apps/wordpress}}:
{{RootCmd|echo "www-apps/wordpress" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}

Then install Wordpress:
{{Emerge|wordpress}}

Fix permissions to enable uploading content (such as banners):
{{RootCmd|chown apache:apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content}}

=== MySQL ===
First visit the Gentoo wiki on [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/MySQL MySQL] and get it ready. 

Then, create a database for WordPress to interact with:

{{RootCmd
|mysql -u root -p
|output=<pre>
mysql> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `wordpress` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET `utf8` COLLATE `utf8_unicode_ci`;
mysql> CREATE USER 'wordpress'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'changeme';
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER ON `wordpress`.* TO 'wordpress'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'changeme';
mysql> \q
</pre>}}

Configure WordPress to interact with the database created. Generate goodies for this file with with [https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/ Wordpress' key generator]
{{RootCmd|nano /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress/wp-config.php}}

Database and database user are "wordpress" and passwords are what you set in the mysql database generation step. (changeme fields)

== 5 minute installer ==
Point a web browser to http://localhost/wordpress/

Name the website, and make create default administrator password.

== Administration and use ==
Administer the WordPress installation at http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/

The shiny new blog is located at http://localhost/wordpress/

=== Plugins and themes ===

Wordpress is a bit of a permissions nightmare.  Themes and plugins will ask for ftp access due to permission problems.  For now I [[User:666threesixes666|666threesixes666]] ([[User talk:666threesixes666|talk]]) am getting around it by.

{{RootCmd|cd /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress|chown -R apache:apache wp-admin wp-includes wp-content}}

This clearly is breaking the security of the webapp.  To restore security once all is set how you want it.

{{RootCmd|chown -R root:root /var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress}}
