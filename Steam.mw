= Valve Steam for Linux =

Valve has released a native (currently x86-only) Linux client for their [https://steampowered.com Steam platform]. They also maintain a blog on this topic [http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/ here] and a community site [http://steamcommunity.com/linux here].

In [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=442176 Bug #442176] and [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7179442.html#7179442 this forum thread] this topic is discussed. There you can also find the current work-in-progress ebuild.

'''Notice:''' the .deb released by Valve is actually only an installer that pulls the actual steam version from their servers and places it as well as the games into ~/Steam/. So, the official package manager is not involved into managing games and steam updates.
