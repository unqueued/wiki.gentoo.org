'''''Steam''' is an Internet-based digital distribution, digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer, and social networking platform developed by Valve Corporation. Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games on multiple computers, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality.'' - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

== Games ==

* Official Steam Linux [http://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=&sort_by=_ASC&os=linux&page=1 games list].
* SteamDB Linux [http://steamdb.info/linux/ games list].

== Prerequisites ==

=== Dependencies ===

{{Note|This section can be skipped when using the <tt>steam-launcher</tt> ebuild from an [[Steam#Overlay|overlay]].}}

Create a [[:/etc/portage/sets|set]] to conveniently manage and update the Steam dependencies without changing the [[world]] set.

{{Note|The following lists may be outdated and require verification. Several libraries may be provided by the Steam runtime, in which case the system library will ''not'' be used.}}

The following packages are ''required'' for Steam:

}}

The following packages are ''optional'' for Steam:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/sets/steam|1=
media-sound/pulseaudio
net-misc/networkmanager
x11-misc/xdg-user-dirs
}}

=== USE flags ===

{{Note|Steam is a 32-bit application and requires a [[multilib]] [[profile]] on amd64, ''unless'' a [[Steam#Chroot|chroot]] is used.}}
The following USE flags are required for amd64:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/steam|1=

x11-proto/xproto abi_x86_32
}}

Next, install the set:
{{Emerge|@steam}}

=== Kernel ===

Steam expects that {{Path|/dev/shm}}, which requires kernel [[tmpfs]] support, is mounted prior to being started. {{Path|/dev/shm}} should be mounted automatically by [[OpenRC]] and [[systemd]] during boot, but can also be explicitly mounted via {{Path|/etc/fstab}}:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
# to limit the size add e.g. size=768M to opts (default is 50%)

#<fs>      <mountpoint>    <type>	<opts>		     <dump/pass>
shm        /dev/shm        tmpfs        nodev,nosuid,noexec  0 0
}}

== Installation ==

{{Note|Currently Steam only supports [[Wikipedia:Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 12.04+. Attempting to run Steam on any other distribution may cause issues. Refer to Steam [[Steam#Client_troubleshooting|client]] and [[Steam#Games_troubleshooting|games]] troubleshooting for details.}}

The Steam installer downloads and installs the Steam client to the users home directory. This prevents Portage from managing the Steam client updates or the software installed by it. The Steam client is solely responsible for managing software installation and updates.

=== Manual ===

Fetch and extract the Steam installer:
{{Cmd
|wget http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/archive/precise/steam_latest.tar.gz
|tar -xvzpf steam_latest.tar.gz
}}

Run the Steam installer:
{{Cmd
|cd steam
|./steam}}

Steam can be started with:
{{Cmd|~/steam/steam}}

{{Note|The following is recommend with a dedicated Steam user account, to prevent Steam (or the software it depends on) from interfering with the regular user account.}}
To avoid restarting or running two X servers in parallel, <tt>su</tt> to the Steam user, and use {{Package|x11-apps/xauth}} to give the Steam user access to the running X server. Refer to [https://github.com/jappeace/bash-steam-launcher bash-steam-launcher] for details.

=== Manual with alternative installer script ===
{{Note|The following instructions are almost the same as the [[Steam#Manual|manual]] instructions, except that an alternative Steam installer script is used.}}
Fetch the Steam installer and extract the required files:
{{Cmd
|wget http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/archive/precise/steam_latest.tar.gz
|tar -xvzf steam_latest.tar.gz steam/bootstraplinux_ubuntu12_32.tar.xz
|tar -xvzf steam_latest.tar.gz steam/steam.desktop
}}

Fetch and run [https://gist.github.com/hasufell Julian Ospald's (hasufell)] Steam installer script:
{{Cmd
|cd ~/steam
|wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hasufell/d02a93eccbe35be7a803/raw/987ea287dc81a60d2eb5fa1bb188eae0a5f1049f/steam
|chmod +x steam
|./steam
}}

=== Overlay ===

The <tt>steam-launcher</tt> ebuild is available from the Gentoo [https://cgit.gentoo.org/proj/gamerlay.git Gamers overlay] or anyc's [https://github.com/anyc/steam-overlay Steam overlay].

=== Chroot ===

It is possible to run Steam in a 32-bit [[chroot]] on amd64 without relying on multilib, or the emul-linux-x86-* packages (which are masked and set for removal<ref>Michał Górny. [https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2015-03-28-true-multilib.html True multilib support on amd64], [https://www.gentoo.org Gentoo], March 28th, 2015. Retrieved on May 25th, 2015.</ref>).

Create the chroot directory:
{{RootCmd
|mkdir /usr/local/steam32
|cd /usr/local/steam32
}}

Fetch and extract the stage tarball:
{{RootCmd
|wget http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/x86/autobuilds/current-stage3-i686/stage3-i686-20150519.tar.bz2
|tar -xvjpf stage3*.tar.bz2
}}

Copy DNS information:
{{RootCmd
|cp -L /etc/resolv.conf etc
}}

Create the Portage directory:
{{RootCmd
|mkdir usr/portage
}}

Mount the necessary filesystems:
{{RootCmd
|mount -R /dev dev
|mount -R /sys sys
|mount -t proc proc proc
|mount -R /usr/portage usr/portage
}}

Chroot with <tt>linux32</tt>, which is provided by the {{Package|sys-apps/util-linux}} package, and reload the environment:

{{RootCmd
|linux32 chroot .
|source /etc/profile && env-update
}}

Create the Steam user:
{{RootCmd
|useradd -m -G audio,video steam
}}

Next, install Steam from one of the above installation methods. When complete, create the following wrapper script to setup the chroot, <tt>su</tt> to the Steam user, and run Steam.

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/local/bin/steam32|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh

CHROOT_DIR=/usr/local/steam32

mount -R /dev "${CHROOT_DIR}/dev"
mount -R /sys "${CHROOT_DIR}/sys"
mount -t proc proc "${CHROOT_DIR}/proc"
mount -R /usr/portage "${CHROOT_DIR}/usr/portage"

[ -f $CHROOT_DIR/var/run/dbus.pid ] {{!}}{{!}} chroot "${CHROOT_DIR}" dbus-launch --system
chroot "${CHROOT_DIR}" su steam -c "dbus-launch steam"

umount -l "${CHROOT_DIR}/dev"
umount -l "${CHROOT_DIR}/sys"
umount -l "${CHROOT_DIR}/proc"
umount -l "${CHROOT_DIR}/usr/portage"
}}

Although the above script uses [[D-Bus]], it is possible to run Steam without it, but a manual method is required to connect the X server from within the chroot.

== Client troubleshooting ==

=== Video drivers ===

* [[nVidia/nvidia-drivers|nvidia-drivers]]: You will need to unmask latest {{Package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}.
* Starting some games (TF, CS:S) on legacy ATI drivers will give this error: "Required OpenGL extension "GL_EXT_texture_sRGB_decode" is not supported. Please update your OpenGL driver." Workaround is [http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/846938351012409765 here].

===  OpenGL GLX context is not using direct rendering ===

If steam is complaining about a lack of 3D capability and you do have a 3D drivers, libraries ('''eselect opengl list''') all setup ('''glxinfo | grep "direct rendering" # direct rendering: Yes'''), steam is accessing the wrong libGL. This was caused by a recent update of {{Package|app-eselect/eselect-opengl}} to version 1.3.0. Temporary workaround:
* Nvidia
{{Cmd|LD_LIBRARY_PATH{{=}}"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib32/opengl/nvidia/lib" ~/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh}}
* ATI
{{Cmd|LD_LIBRARY_PATH{{=}}"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib32/opengl/ati/lib" ~/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh}}

=== Fonts ===

Some people seem to have problems with missing fonts. A user reported it being solved by emerging {{Package|media-fonts/font-bitstream-100dpi}}.

Sometimes Xorg does not recognize the new fonts installed. To fix this temp. run:
{{Cmd
|xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/100dpi/
|./steam.sh
}}

You may also need {{Package|media-fonts/corefonts}} if fonts don't appear to be rendering correctly.

The game [http://www.stealthbastard.com Stealth Bastard Deluxe] will segfault if {{Package|media-fonts/font-misc-misc}} is not installed [http://steamcommunity.com/app/209190/discussions/0/810923580565231302], specifically the game will request the fonts "9x15"/"9x15b", so check with {{Package|x11-apps/xlsfonts}} if those are available, otherwise add them to the fontpath and possibly add an alias in e.g. {{Path|/usr/share/fonts/misc/fonts.alias}}:
{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/fonts/misc/fonts.alias|title=Aliases for misc fonts|1=
9x15  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1
9x15B -misc-fixed-bold-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1
}}

=== Mouse cursor ===

If your WM/DE does not set a mouse pointer theme, then Steam will overwrite the default X11 cursor theme, often resulting in a reversed pointer from left to right.

To fix this, just install and enable a compatible cursor theme via your WM/DE (e.g. {{Package|x11-themes/vanilla-dmz-xcursors}}).

You can also enable the installed theme manually with the following method:
{{Cmd
|mkdir ~/.icons
|ln -s /usr/share/cursors/xorg-x11/Vanilla-DMZ ~/.icons/default
}}
{{Note|This fix will not work if you will try to symlink a KDE cursor theme (eg: Oxygen_White).}}
If the mouse cursor gets stuck pointing in the wrong direction after exiting steam you can work around that via:
{{Cmd|xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr}}

=== Flashplayer on amd64 ===

Get the [http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/completion/?installer=Flash_Player_11.2_for_other_Linux_(.tar.gz)_32-bit 32bit flashplayer from adobe] and extract {{Path|libflashplayer.so}} to your current working dir. Now run:
{{Cmd
|mkdir <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins
|mv libflashplayer.so <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins/
|chmod +x <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins/libflashplayer.so
}}
Typically the path located in {{Path|~/.local/share/Steam}}.
Alternatively emerge {{Package|www-plugins/adobe-flash}} with <code>abi_x86_32</code> option enabled and run:
{{Cmd
|mkdir <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins
|ln -s /usr/lib32/nsbrowser/plugins/libflashplayer.so <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins/
}}

=== Memory corruption on startup ===

You might get an error like this:
{{Cmd|steam|output=<pre>
*** glibc detected *** zenity: malloc(): memory corruption: 0x00000000016cf020 ***
</pre>}}
Try to emerge {{Package|x11-libs/libXi}} and it should work.

=== Hardened Gentoo ===

It looks like the steam binary has rwx bits in it. You will need to mark the binary with the following to get it working on a hardened system.
{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam}}

Binaries of most games also should be paxmarked, for ex.:
{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/"World of Goo/WorldOfGoo"}}
{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Uplink/uplink.bin.x86_64}}
{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team\ Fortress\ 2/hl2_linux}}
Failure to perform these paxmarkings will result in the game failing to run with little information given. You can check if the game needs to be paxmarked by running the game's startup script or binary file (found under {{Path|~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps}} or {{Path|~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common}}) under a debugger. This can be accomplished with some of Valve's provided startup scripts by passing in gdb in a <code>GAME_DEBUGGER</code> environment variable, for ex.:
{{Cmd|env GAME_DEBUGGER{{=}}gdb ./hl2.sh}}
If the binary needs to be paxmarked, gdb should output something similar to "warning: Cannot call inferior functions, Linux kernel PaX protection forbids return to non-executable pages!" and/or "Cannot access memory at address 0x80486c6."

After latest update (around Jul 2013) steam also need paxmarked sh when the openGL libraries require RWX markings or it fail to run games from steam client (see https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/254 for details):
{{Cmd|sudo paxctl-ng -m /bin/bash}}
However, this causes bash to not run. Also as it is a security issue you are strongly encouraged to try without paxmarking it. If it works for you when using proprietary nvidia drivers please report it back.

=== Steam runtime ===

By default, Valve bundles their own libraries with the steam package and uses them instead of installed system libraries. This behavior can be changed by setting the environment variable <code>STEAM_RUNTIME=0</code>.
{{Warning|
It is not recommended to deactivate Steam runtime. This can lead to numerous problems, including runtime and missing 32-bit libraries.
}}

=== Steam reset ===

If you want to wipe out your current steam installation which includes your installed games and reinstall steam without losing their data, you can use the <code>--reset</code> command line option:
{{Cmd|steam --reset}}

=== Steam without D-Bus ===

When running Steam without D-Bus, do ''not'' select the <code>Remember my password</code> option at the Steam login dialog, otherwise Steam will segfault the next time it is run <ref>Shished. [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3415 Steam segfaults when "remember my password" is checked], [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux Steam for Linux], July 28th, 2014. Retrieved on May 25th, 2015.</ref>. If Steam is segfaulting as a result of this option being selected, run the following to fix the issue:
{{Cmd|rm -fr ~/.local/share/Steam/config}}

=== Taskbar buttons persist when Steam is minimzed to the system tray ===

Depending on your DE, you might have a taskbar button showing for Steam all the time, even when the main window is closed or minimized to the systray. To stop this behavior, add this to {{Path|/etc/environment}}.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/environment|title=Basic Environment Variables for all Processes|1=
STEAM_FRAME_FORCE_CLOSE=1}}
You will need to logout and back in to enact the changes.

== Games troubleshooting ==

==== Texture compression ====

Many games, especially those that use the [[Wikipedia:Source (game engine)|Source]] engine, require [[Wikipedia:S3 Texture Compression|S3 Texture Compression (S3TC)]] support. Without S3TC support, these games will usually have black or missing textures, or fail to start.

* Enabling S3TC support:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/steam|title=Required USE flag for amd64|1=
media-libs/libtxc_dxtn abi_x86_32
}}
Install the {{Package|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}} package:
{{Emerge|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}}

Next, confirm if S3TC support is enabled:
{{RootCmd|glxinfo {{!}} grep GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc|output=<pre>
    GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
</pre>
}}

If S3TC support is ''not'' enabled, ensure that the <code>VIDEO_CARDS</code> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} is set to the correct value, and update the video driver to the latest version.

If S3TC support is enabled but games fail to start with the following error:
<pre>
This system does not support the OpenGL extension GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
</pre>
Run the following before starting Steam:
{{Cmd
|export force_s3tc_enable{{=}}true
}}
If [[nouveau]] drivers are being used, installing {{Package|x11-libs/gtkglarea}} may be required to stop the above error.

=== Dota 2 ===

* If black textures are visible and an older (<9.1.6) {{Package|media-libs/mesa}} is installed, update {{Package|media-libs/mesa}} to a recent version<ref>arkrost. [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/683 Black texture], [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2 Dota 2 Linux and Mac client], August 14th, 2013. Retrieved on May 26th, 2015.</ref>.

* If black textures are visible and a recent {{Package|media-libs/mesa}} is installed, building {{Package|media-libs/mesa}} with the <code>-bindist</code> USE flag may fix the issue<ref>michaelsudnick. [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/1434 Black ground texture on Gentoo amd64, radeonsi open source driver], [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2 Dota 2 Linux and Mac client], July 12th, 2014. Retrieved on May 26th, 2015.</ref>.

* If a red screen is visible during start and textures are missing in-game, refer to [[Steam#Texture compression|texture compression]] for details<ref>proatx. [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/1061 Red-screen and no textures], [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2 Dota 2 Linux and Mac client], December 16th, 2013. Retrieved on May 26th, 2015.</ref>.

=== Left 4 Dead 2 ===

* If black textures are visible, refer to [[Steam#Texture compression|texture compression]] for details.

=== Rust (legacy) ===

* If the launcher fails to start, adding <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" %command%</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Rust->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>, may fix the issue.

=== Starbound ===

* If the launcher fails to start with the following error:
<pre>
This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "xcb".

Available platform plugins are: xcb.

Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
</pre>
Adding <code>$(dirname %command%)/starbound</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Starbound->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>, may fix the issue.

=== Team Fortress 2 ===

* If a black screen is visible for 1-2 seconds, adding <code>-nojoy</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Team Fortress 2->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>, may fix the issue.

=== X<sup>3</sup>: Terran Conflict and X<sup>3</sup>: Albion Prelude ===

* If red, green and blue stripes are visible, or the launcher fails to start, refer to [[Steam#Texture compression|texture compression]] for details<ref>timon37. [http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=335500 X³: TC and AP - Linux support thread], [http://forum.egosoft.com X Universe Forums], April 13th, 2013. Retrieved on May 26th, 2015.</ref>.
