Valve has released a native (currently x86-only) Linux client for their [https://steampowered.com Steam platform] as part of a closed beta.

== Notice == 
This is '''beta''' software. The .deb released by Valve is actually only an installer that pulls the actual steam version from their servers and places it as well as the games into ~/Steam/. So, the official package manager is not involved in managing games and steam updates.
