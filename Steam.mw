Valve has released a native (currently x86-only) Linux client for their [https://steampowered.com Steam platform] as part of a closed beta.

== Notice == 
This is '''beta''' software. The .deb released by Valve is actually only an installer that pulls the actual steam version from their servers and places it as well as the games into ~/Steam/. So, the official package manager cannot be involved in managing games and steam updates.

== Games ==
* Official Valve Linux [http://store.steampowered.com/browse/linux/ Games List]
* [http://cdr.xpaw.ru/linux/ CDR List] (includes future (beta) releases for Linux)

== Installation ==
Download the .deb archive and put the following files into the same directory:
* bootstraplinux_ubuntu12_32.tar.xz (from the .deb archive)
* steam.desktop (from the .deb archive)
* steam (get the script [http://slexy.org/view/s2iz51l62y here])
Make '''steam''' executable and run it. There are also a few icons in the .deb archive.
{{Note|Alternatively you can use the steam-meta ebuild from [https://github.com/anyc/steam-overlay steam-overlay].}}

== Prerequisites ==
Things you need in order to run steam.
=== Dependencies ===
If you don't use the ebuild then you can create a '''set''' to conveniently manage and update the steam dependencies without changing your world file.
After you have created the file ''/etc/portage/sets/steam'' as shown below, run: {{Emerge|@steam}}

=== Kernel ===
You need [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt tmpfs] activated in your kernel and ''/dev/shm'' mounted.
{{Kernel|tmpfs support|<pre>
File Systems --->
  Pseudo Filesystems --->
    [*] Tmpfs virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
</pre>}}
{{Note|/dev/shm should be automatically mounted by the devfs initscript, however you can do so explicitly and with additional options via fstab.}}
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
# to limit the size add e.g. size=768M to opts (default is 50%)

#<fs>      <mountpoint>    <type>	<opts>		     <dump/pass>
shm        /dev/shm        tmpfs        nodev,nosuid,noexec  0 0
</pre>}}

== Troubleshooting ==
A few tricks to get things working.
=== Video drivers ===
* '''Nvidia''': You will need to unmask latest {{Package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}.
* If S3TC support is missing, try media-libs/libtxc_dxtn.

=== Fonts ===
Some people seem to have problems with missing fonts. A user reported it being solved by emerging {{Package|media-fonts/font-bitstream-100dpi}}.

Sometimes Xorg does not recognise the new fonts installed. To fix this temp. run:
{{Cmd
|xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/100dpi/
|./steam.sh
}}

=== Mouse cursor ===
If your WM/DE does not set a mouse pointer theme, then Steam will overwrite the default X11 cursor theme, often resulting in a reversed pointer from left to right.

To fix this, just install and enable a compatible cursor theme via your WM/DE (e.g. {{Package|x11-themes/vanilla-dmz-xcursors}}).

You can also enable the installed theme manually with the following method:
{{Cmd
|mkdir ~/.icons
|ln -s /usr/share/cursors/xorg-x11/Vanilla-DMZ ~/.icons/default
}}
{{Note| This fix will not work if you will try to symlink a kde cursor theme (eg: Oxygen_White).}}

=== Flashplayer on amd64 ===
Get the [http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/completion/?installer=Flash_Player_11.2_for_other_Linux_(.tar.gz)_32-bit 32bit flashplayer from adobe] and extract ''libflashplayer.so'' to your current working dir. Now run:
{{Cmd
|mkdir <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins
|mv libflashplayer.so <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins/
|chmod +x <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins/libflashplayer.so
}}
Alternatively emerge {{Package|www-plugins/adobe-flash}} with '''32bit''' useflag and run:
{{Cmd
|mkdir <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins
|ln -s /opt/Adobe/flash-player32/libflashplayer.so <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins/
}}

=== Games ===

==== Team Fortress 2 ====
If you only get a black screen for 1-2 seconds, try adding "-nojoy" to Game->Properties->"Set Launch Options".

If you have problems with sound and pulseaudio, try starting with {{Cmd|SDL_AUDIODRIVER{{=}}alsa steam}} and also check [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7059586.html?sid=87e19427207e5dbcc70bbc271f1dee68#7059586 this post in FGO.]

== Running non-native games ==
Non-native games can be "piped" through wine via ''binfmt''. See [http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/882965239658551856/ here] and [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wine#Using_Wine_as_an_interpreter_for_Win16.2FWin32_binaries here]. This currently works only for games which have OS-check disabled.

== Further help ==
Before you ask anywhere else, refer to the [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-930354.html gentoo forum thread]. Post your solutions and update this wiki page if someone confirms. Please don't remove content without [[Talk:Steam|Discussion]] unless it's wrong content.
