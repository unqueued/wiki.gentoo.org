Valve has released a native (currently x86-only) Linux client for their [https://steampowered.com Steam platform] as part of a closed beta.

== Notice == 
This is '''beta''' software. The .deb released by Valve is actually only an installer that pulls the actual steam version from their servers and places it as well as the games into ~/Steam/. So, the official package manager is not involved in managing games and steam updates.

== Installation ==
Download the .deb archive and put the following files into the same directory:
* bootstraplinux_ubuntu12_32.tar.xz (from the .deb archive)
* steam.desktop (from the .deb archive)
* steam (get the script [http://slexy.org/view/s2iz51l62y here])
Make '''steam''' executable and run it. There are also a few icons in the .deb archive.

== Dependencies ==
You can create a '''set''' to conveniently manage and update the steam dependencies without changing your world file.
