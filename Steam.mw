Valve has released a native (currently x86-only) Linux client for their [https://steampowered.com Steam platform] as part of a closed beta.

== Notice == 
This is '''beta''' software. The .deb released by Valve is actually only an installer that pulls the actual steam version from their servers and places it as well as the games into ~/Steam/. So, the official package manager cannot be involved in managing games and steam updates.

== Games ==
This is a list of games that already work for the native linux client:
* World of Goo
* Trine 2
* Trackmania: Nations Forever (via {{Package|app-emulation/wine}})

== Installation ==
Get the ebuild [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=442176 here] and put in into your [[Overlay|overlay]] as {{Package|games-util/steam-installer}}.

Then run {{Emerge|steam-installer}}

== Working around beta subscription ==
If you are not selected by Valve as beta participant, then you should launch Steam like that
{{Cmd
|steam steam://store
}}

== Kernel ==
You need [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt tmpfs] activated in your kernel and ''/dev/shm'' mounted.
{{Kernel|tmpfs support|<pre>
File Systems --->
  Pseudo Filesystems --->
    [*] Tmpfs virtual memory file system support (former shmfs)
</pre>}}
{{Note|/dev/shm should be automatically mounted by the devfs initscript, however you can do so explicitly and with additional options via fstab.}}
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
# to limit the size add e.g. size=768M to opts (default is 50%)

#<fs>      <mountpoint>    <type>	<opts>		     <dump/pass>
shm        /dev/shm        tmpfs        nodev,nosuid,noexec  0 0
</pre>}}

== Video drivers ==
* '''Nvidia''': You will need to unmask latest {{Package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}.
* If you are using open-source drivers that are based on mesa (e.g., nouveau, radeon), you need to unmask >=mesa-9.0, see {{Package|media-libs/mesa}}. Note: If you are on AMD64 you have to compile mesa yourself for x86, as it is not included in emul-*-20121028 packages.

== Fonts ==
Some people seem to have problems with missing fonts. A user reported it being solved by emerging {{Package|media-fonts/font-bitstream-100dpi}}.

Sometimes Xorg does not recognise the new fonts installed. To fix this temp. run:
{{Cmd
|xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/100dpi/
|steam
}}

== Flashplayer on amd64 ==
Get the [http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/completion/?installer=Flash_Player_11.2_for_other_Linux_(.tar.gz)_32-bit 32bit flashplayer from adobe] and extract ''libflashplayer.so'' to your current working dir. Now run:
{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /usr/lib/browser-plugins
|mv libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/browser-plugins/
|chmod +x /usr/lib/browser-plugins/libflashplayer.so
}}
Currently no known side-effects or interference with regular browsers.

== Running non-native games ==
Non-native games can be "piped" through wine via ''binfmt''. See [http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/882965239658551856/ here] and [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wine#Using_Wine_as_an_interpreter_for_Win16.2FWin32_binaries here]. This currently works only for games which have OS-check disabled.
