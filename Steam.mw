Valve has released a native (currently x86-only) Linux client for their [https://steampowered.com Steam platform] as part of a closed beta.

== Notice == 
This is '''beta''' software. The .deb released by Valve is actually only an installer that pulls the actual steam version from their servers and places it as well as the games into ~/Steam/. So, the official package manager cannot be involved in managing games and steam updates.

== Games ==
This is a list of games that already work for the native linux client:
* world of goo

== Installation ==
Download the .deb archive and put the following files into the same directory:
* bootstraplinux_ubuntu12_32.tar.xz (from the .deb archive)
* steam.desktop (from the .deb archive)
* steam (get the script [http://slexy.org/view/s2iz51l62y here])
Make '''steam''' executable and run it. There are also a few icons in the .deb archive.

== Dependencies ==
You can create a '''set''' to conveniently manage and update the steam dependencies without changing your world file.

{{Note|On amd64 you will need '''multilib''' useflag for gcc and glibc}}
Now run: {{Emerge|@steam}}

== Kernel ==
You need [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt tmpfs] activated in your kernel and ''/dev/shm'' mounted.
{{Kernel|tmpfs support|<pre>
File Systems --->
  Pseudo Filesystems --->
    [*] Tmpfs virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
</pre>}}
{{Note|/dev/shm should be automatically mounted by the devfs initscript, however you can do so explicitly and with additional options via fstab.}}
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
# to limit the size add e.g. size=768M to opts (default is 50%)

#<fs>      <mountpoint>    <type>	<opts>		     <dump/pass>
shm        /dev/shm        tmpfs        nodev,nosuid,noexec  0 0
</pre>}}

== Video drivers ==
'''Nvidia''': You will need to unmask latest {{Package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}.

== Fonts ==
Some people seem to have problems with missing fonts. A user reported it being solved by emerging {{Package|media-fonts/font-bitstream-100dpi}}.

== Flashplayer on amd64 ==
Get the [http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/completion/?installer=Flash_Player_11.2_for_other_Linux_(.tar.gz)_32-bit 32bit flashplayer from adobe] and extract ''libflashplayer.so'' to your current working dir. Now run:
{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /usr/lib/browser-plugins
|mv libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/browser-plugins/
|chmod +x /usr/lib/browser-plugins/libflashplayer.so
}}
Currently no known side-effects or interference with regular browsers.

== Running non-native games ==
Non-native games can be "piped" through wine via ''binfmt''. See [http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/882965239658551856/ here] and [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wine#Using_Wine_as_an_interpreter_for_Win16.2FWin32_binaries here]. This currently works only for games which have OS-check disabled.

== Further Troubleshooting ==
Before you ask anywhere else, refer to the [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-930354.html gentoo forum thread]. Post your solutions and update this wiki page if someone confirms.
