=== Configuring Secure Boot using KeyTool ===

If you encountered the "wrong filesystem permissions" issue when trying to use efi-updatevar and you cannot add keys with your BIOS, there is another solution: the KeyTool EFI application that comes with efitools. As a prerequisite, I recommend using [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=191056 this script] to generate new keys, as it ensures you have .esl files for all your own keys. '''Before''' running that script, copy the Windows keys to a different directory (like /etc/efikeys/old), as the script will probably erase them.  After generating keys with that script, follow these steps to install them, as well as the original keys, to your system:

# Mount the EFI flash drive using a command like: {{RootCmd|mount -o rw /dev/sdZn /mnt}}
# Copy the keys to the drive: {{RootCmd|cd /etc/efikeys|mkdir -v -p /mnt/keys/old|cp *.esl *.crt *.auth /mnt/keys/|cd old|cp *.esl *.crt *.auth /mnt/keys/old}}
# Back up the old bootx64.efi on your flash drive and copy the KeyTool in its place: {{RootCmd|mv /mnt/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi /mnt/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.gentoo|cp /usr/share/efitools/efi/KeyTool.efi /mnt/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi}}
# Reboot to BIOS and reset your keys (enter Setup Mode) again
# Using your BIOS's boot menu or your favorite equivalent, boot to the USB drive ('''not''' to the Gentoo entry, but instead to the generic entry)
# You'll be presented with a blue screen with a menu in the middle. Select "Edit Keys".
# Starting with the '''Key Exchange Key''' (notably '''not''' the Platform Key) and working your way down, select each key type (except for Machine Owner Key) and do two things:
## Replace key(s) with the original keys, navigating the directory tree until you find where you put them.{{Note|With some BIOSes, you may encounter problems inserting your {{c|db.crt}} under {{c|KeyTool}}, once your {{c|KEK}} has been inserted. If this occurs, try ''appending'' (in {{c|KeyTool}}) your {{c|db.auth}} file instead (creation of this file was described in a note in the main text).}}
## Add New Key with your key, navigating the directory tree until you find them. You don't need to do this for the Forbidden signatures.
# Once you've done this for all the keys other than the PK, select that one and replace it with your own key.
# Press ESC until you get back to the main menu, then select "Exit". You're done!
