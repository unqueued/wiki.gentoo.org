Misc licenses that are probably free software, i.e. follow the [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html free software definition] but are not approved by either FSF or OSI. Preferably on the long term these should be cleared up and moved to other sets. Licenses in this list should ''not'' appear directly or indirectly in [[{{BASEPAGENAME}}/FSF-APPROVED|FSF-APPROVED]] or [[{{BASEPAGENAME}}/OSI-APPROVED|OSI-APPROVED]].
