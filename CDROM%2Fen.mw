This article describes the setup of an internal optical drive like CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray drives.

== Installation ==

=== Hardware detection ===

To choose the right driver, first detect the used storage controller. [[Hardware detection|lspci]] can be used for this task:

{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep --color -E "IDE{{!}}SATA"}}

=== Kernel ===

Activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=Kernel options for optical storage media|1=
Device Drivers --->
   <*> Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers  --->
      [*] ATA ACPI Support
  
      # If the drive is connected to a SATA Port Multiplier:
      [*] SATA Port Multiplier support
  
      # Select the driver for the SATA controller, e.g.:
      <*> AHCI SATA support (ahci)
  
      # If the drive is connected to an IDE controller:
      [*] ATA SFF support
      [*] ATA BMDMA support
  
      # Select the driver for the IDE controller, e.g.:
        <*> Intel ESB, ICH, PIIX3, PIIX4 PATA/SATA support (ata_piix)
  
   SCSI device support  ---> 
      <*> SCSI device support
      <*> SCSI CDROM support
      <*> SCSI generic support
  
File systems  --->
   CD-ROM/DVD Filesystems  --->
      <M> ISO 9660 CDROM file system support
      [*] Microsoft Joliet CDROM extensions
      [*] Transparent decompression extension
      <M> UDF file system support
}}

== Usage ==

Filesystems can be mounted in several ways:

* [[mount]] - Command for mounting file systems
* [[fstab]] - Automatic mount at boot time.
* [[removable media]] - Mount on demand.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on demand.

== Troubleshooting ==
