== Information for users ==

Packages link to this page, because their upstream homepage has been removed or never existed.

Sometimes you can find the original upstream URL either as another link in the <code>HOMEPAGE</code> variable or commented out in the ebuild.

Developers usually try to figure out whether upstream really vanished or the homepage just got moved. But they can miss some things too, servers can get online again, etc. If you happen to know where upstream went or if the original homepage is online again, please open a bug report at https://bugs.gentoo.org/ and tell the developers about it!

Missing upstream does not automatically lead to the removal of a package. But if bugs are piling up for a package where upstream is missing the developers may decide to remove the package rather than fixing bugs.

== Information for developers ==

If the homepage of a package you maintain is unavailable and no new location can be found, please update the according variable in every ebuild:

<pre>HOMEPAGE="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/No_homepage"</pre>
