== Some features rejected for EAPI 5 ==

* User patches
*: [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/pms.git;a=commit;h=a8bf7862967cce36b7f1b408934a774126da2538 PMS wording], [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/portage.git;a=commit;h=6b4b621f1abcf21d3bfa54b323126a3ef11eb52c Portage no-op dummy stub]
** Intrusive.
** Current wording of the spec requires that every ebuild includes a call to the apply_user_patches function in src_prepare. An alternative would be to apply user patches after src_prepare as a default, if the ebuild doesn't call the respective function.
** The spec doesn't provide any kind of epatch function, so we will end up having two copies of epatch, one for user patches, and the other (from eclass) for ebuilds.
** Are we happy with the name apply_user_patches? (epatch_user? euserpatch?)

* EJOBS variable
*: {{Bug|273101}}
*: [http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_750e33f68b16d971dff1f40dd9145e56.xml]
** Discussion was almost 4 years ago. Is there (still) consensus?
