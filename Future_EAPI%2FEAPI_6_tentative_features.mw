== Features rejected for EAPI 5 ==

<ol type="a">

: {{Bug|463768}}
:* Needed for PATCHES support and user patches
:* This would duplicate epatch() from eutils, in simplified form.
:* Name "eapply" has been suggested.

<li> User patches
: [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/pms.git;a=commit;h=a8bf7862967cce36b7f1b408934a774126da2538 PMS wording], [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/portage.git;a=commit;h=6b4b621f1abcf21d3bfa54b323126a3ef11eb52c Portage no-op dummy stub]
:* Intrusive.
:* Current wording of the spec requires that every ebuild includes a call to the apply_user_patches function in src_prepare.

<li> EJOBS variable
: {{Bug|273101}}
: [http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_750e33f68b16d971dff1f40dd9145e56.xml gentoo-dev discussion]
