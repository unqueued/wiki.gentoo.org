* User patches
*: [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/pms.git;a=commit;h=a8bf7862967cce36b7f1b408934a774126da2538 PMS wording], [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/portage.git;a=commit;h=6b4b621f1abcf21d3bfa54b323126a3ef11eb52c Portage no-op dummy stub]
** Intrusive.
** Current wording of the spec requires that every ebuild includes a call to the apply_user_patches function in src_prepare.
** We will need two patch applying functions: the existing epatch in eutils.eclass and a new one (eapply? {{Bug|463768}}) implemented in the package manager.
** Are we happy with the name apply_user_patches? (eapply_user?)

* EJOBS variable
