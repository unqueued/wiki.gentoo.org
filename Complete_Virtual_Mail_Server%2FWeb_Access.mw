== Introduction ==
One heavily used function of E-mail, is webmail access.  Some users use it solely as their access, others use it as backup or when their own system is not available. There are several options available, with {{Package|mail-client/squirrelmail}} and {{Package|mail-client/roundcube}} being the most common once. Squirrelmail can be used if bandwith is a huge issue, roundcube is recommended otherwise and the focus of this article.

== Installing roundcube ==
Roudcube can store its configuration in a database. Things like local addressbook, identities etc. Here there are several options available. Use a local, per vhost based SQlite storage pool, use a postgres/mysql database per vhost or have all vhosts share the same database. There can be advantages for any of the above options. If webmail, for various domains, is on the same host as the imap server, then using one database for all domains is fine and can be an advantage. It could be desided that each domain, each vhost gets its own webmail interface (different skin and plugins) where all users could still log in. Meaning in the event of one of the vhosts webmail being broken, they can still access their e-mail normally using a different vhost. Whether the users settings 'live' in all vhosts or not, is based on the imap server. Roundcube bases its user id on the ''mail_host'' e.g. the imap server and thus when using localhost the user 'profile' is identical everywhere.

{{USEflag|package=mail-client/roundcube
|ldap++Yes
|postgres++Yes
|spell++Yes
|sqlite++
|ssl++Yes
|vhosts++Yes
}}
{{Note|Only postgres or mysql is required when not using SQLite.}}

After choosing the appropiate USEflags, roundcube should be emerged.
{{Emerge|mail-client/roundcube}}

This only installs roundcube to the host, but not into the vhost.
{{RootCmd|webapp-config -I -h webmail.example.com -d roundcube roundcube 0.6}}

=== using Postgres ===
Unless there is some serious security concern, only one database user is required to access all databases used by roundcube.
{{RootCmd|createuser -U postgres -D -P -R -S roundcube|output=<pre>
Enter password for new role: $password
Enter it again: $password
</pre>}}

Roundcube will also need a database. Different names will have to be chosen when using different databases per domain.
{{RootCmd|createdb -U postgres roundcubemail -O roundcube}}

Finally, load the initial database into postgres.
{{RootCmd|psql -U roundcube roundcubemail < /var/www/webmail.example.com/htdocs/roundcube/SQL/postgres.initial.sql}}

{{Note|Having roundcube in a seperate directory is incredibly usefull. Installing (and testing) a second webmail client for example or migrating to a new one can be so much easier having it on the same host. However the standard URL, webmail.example.com won't open up roundcube anymore. To counter this, a simple index.php in the root of htdocs directory can help this.<pre>
<?php
	header("Location: roundcube/");
?>
</pre>}}

== Configuring roundcube ==
Configuring roundcube is as simple as editing two configuration files in ''/var/www/webmail.example.com/htdocs/roundcube/config/''.

To access the database only this line really needs to be changed. It is quite self explanatory.
{{File|/var/www/webmail.example.com/htdocs/roundcube/config/db.inc.php|Database access|<pre>
$rcmail_config['db_dsnw'] = 'mysql://roundcube:pass@localhost/roundcubemail';
</pre>}}

Here are the essential changes listed required for roundcube operation. More can be done to personalize the setup.
{{File|/var/www/webmail.example.com/htdocs/roundcube/config/main.inc.php|Roundcube configuration|<pre>
-$rcmail_config['default_host'] = '';
+$rcmail_config['default_host'] = 'localhost';

-$rcmail_config['smtp_server'] = '';
+$rcmail_config['smtp_server'] = 'localhost';

 // SMTP username (if required) if you use %u as the username Roundcube
 // will use the current username for login
+$rcmail_config['smtp_user'] = '';
-$rcmail_config['smtp_user'] = '%u';

 // SMTP password (if required) if you use %p as the password Roundcube
 // will use the current user's password for login
-$rcmail_config['smtp_pass'] = '';
+$rcmail_config['smtp_pass'] = '%p';

 // this key is used to encrypt the users imap password which is stored
 // in the session record (and the client cookie if remember password is enabled).
 // please provide a string of exactly 24 chars.
-$rcmail_config['des_key'] = 'rcmail-!24ByteDESkey*Str';
+$rcmail_config['des_key'] = '$supersecret24bytestring';
</pre>}}

== Testing roundcube ==
Log into webmail via http://webmail.example.com/ and the test mailbox should show. Also sending mail should be working normally.
