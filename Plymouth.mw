'''Plymouth''' is used to show splash screens during system boot and shutdown. It is a more modern alternative to [[fbsplash]] and provides flicker-free animated boot splashes with support for progress bars, solar flares, and other nifty things. In addition to [[OpenRC]], it also has full [[systemd]] support. Since it is a boot splash tool, Plymouth does not provide background eye-candy for the ttys way fbsplash does (meaning it shows no decoration on the consoles after the system has booted).

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=sys-boot/plymouth|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|sys-boot/plymouth}}:
|debug
|gdm
|gtk+yes++Adds support for x11-libs/gtk (The GIMP Toolkit)
|libkms+yes
|pango+yes
|static-libs
}}

=== Emerge ===

The {{Package|sys-boot/plymouth}} package can be installed by running:

{{Emerge|sys-boot/plymouth}}

== Configuration ==

=== Kernel ===

Specific kernel options must be altered in order to get Plymouth working properly. Use the <tt>genkernel --menuconfig all</tt> command (or equivalent) in order to modify the kernel configuration.

==== Bootup logo ====

It is ''highly'' advised to '''disable''' the Linux bootup logo. On some systems having the bootup logo displayed seems to cause problems.

{{KernelBox|title=This example shows the correct way to disable the bootup logo:|1=<pre>

   Graphics Support --->
      [ ] Bootup logo  --->
</pre>
}}

{{Important|Be sure to enable kernel modesetting (KMS) for the system's respective graphics card.}}

==== KMS for Intel cards ====

{{KernelBox|title=Intel onboard GPUs set to use modesetting:|1=<pre>
Device Drivers --->
   Graphics Support --->
      <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support)  --->

         [*]     Enable modesetting on intel by default
</pre>
}}

{{Important|If this is the user's first time modifying settings for on-board Intel GPUs the [[Intel|Intel article]] should be referenced for additional configuration.}}

==== KMS for Nvidia cards (Nouveau drivers) ====

}}

{{Important|If this is the user's first time changing settings for the NVIDIA graphics card using the nouveau driver be sure to reference the [[nouveau|nouveau article]] for additional information.}}

==== KMS for Nvidia cards (official drivers) ====

To use the official Nvidia drivers see the wiki's [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NVidia/nvidia-drivers official Nvidia-drivers article].

{{Note|So far the results of using official Nvidia-drivers are untested with Plymouth.}}

==== KMS for Radeon cards ====

{{Important|If this is the user's first time setting up a Radeon graphics card be sure to reference the [[radeon|radeon article]] for further information.}}

=== Initramfs generators ===

There are currently two initramfs generators that support Plymouth. Either one will produce essentially the same result; determining which to use is entirely the choice of the user. This article does not go into detail on troubleshooting failed results, so choosing the more comfortable initramfs would be a wise choice. Using genkernel-next is recommended, since many users are already familiar with using genkernel.

At this point in time normal [[genkernel]] cannot create an [[initramfs]] with a Plymouth theme included. Therefore, in order to proceed, either [[dracut]] or {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}} will need to be selected, in order to build an initramfs capable of including a Plymouth theme. From this point onward, this configuration guide will continue presuming genkernel-next has been selected, since it is marked stable in the Portage tree and is essentially a drop in replacement for normal genkernel. Instructions for Dracut will be provided, although they are far from a full configuration.

==== Genkernel-Next ====

Continue by enabling the <code>plymouth</code> USE flag in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} in order for Portage to <tt>emerge</tt> genkernel-next properly:

{{RootCmd|echo "sys-kernel/genkernel-next plymouth" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}}

When using genkernel-next skip the [[Plymouth#Init_System_Configurations|Dracut section]] that immediately follows this section.

==== Dracut ====

Dracut ({{Package|sys-kernel/dracut}}) is an alternative initram generator created by the Fedora development team. Before reading the rest of Dracut guide here is a fun fact: both Plymouth and Dracut are cities in Massachusetts. This is speculation, however it would appear the creators of these programs might have taken this into consideration.

[[Dracut#Installation|Follow this link]] for Dracut installation instructions.

Dracut must be configured to be used with Plymouth.

Add <code>plymouth</code> as a module to the {{path|/etc/dracut.conf}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/dracut.conf|title=Configuring Dracut for Plymouth|lang=text|1=
#logfile=/var/log/dracut.log
#fileloglvl=6

# Exact list of dracut modules to use. Modules not listed here are not going
# to be included.  If only optional modules are needed use
# add_dracutmodules option instead.
#dracutmodules+=""

# dracut modules to omit
#omit_dracutmodules+=""

# dracut modules to add to the default
add_dracutmodules+="plymouth"
}}

{{Important|If this an initial Dracut configuration, get acquainted with it by [[Dracut|reading the Dracut article]]. Do not take the information in this small section as all that is needed to configure Dracut!}}

Generate a new initramfs using Dracut:

{{RootCmd|dracut --force}}

Configure GRUB2 to use Dracut initramfs:
{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

=== Init systems ===

==== OpenRC ====
Use a text editor of choice to enable Plymouth and the Plymouth theme in genkernel-next's configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/genkernel.conf|title=Configuring Genkernel for Plymouth|lang=bash|1=<pre>
# Enable splashutils in early space (initrd). Default is "no".
# SPLASH="no"

# Installs (or not if set to "no") Plymouth into the initramfs. If "splash" will be
# passed to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT at boot Plymouth will be activated.
PLYMOUTH="yes"

# Embeds the given Plymouth theme into the initramfs.
PLYMOUTH_THEME="solar"
</pre>}}

{{Warning|The <code>SPLASH</code> variable listed in the file above should be set to "no". The <code>SPLASH</code> variable configures an option for the fbsplash bootsplash loader ({{Package|media-gfx/splashutils}}) '''NOT''' Plymouth.}}

Additionally, edit the {{Path|/etc/rc.conf}} file to make RC non-interactive:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/rc.conf|title=RC configuration for Plymouth example|lang=bash|1=
rc_interactive=”NO”
}}

Regenerate the initramfs using the <tt>genkernel</tt> command:

{{RootCmd|genkernel initramfs}}

==== Systemd ====

Plymouth automatically registers itself with systemd to show splash screens during shutdown and restart. No additional configuration is required.

=== Bootloaders ===

==== GRUB2 ====

When using GRUB2, an update to GRUB2's configuration file must be made in order to enable the splash screen during early boot. Append the options <code>quiet splash</code> to the <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> variable, adjust the resolution in the <code>GRUB_GFXMODE</code> variable to match the desired resolution for the monitor, and set <code>GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX</code> to "keep" in order to preserve the graphics mode during the entire boot.

This all can be performed by modifying the {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default/grub|title=Configuring GRUB2 for Plymouth|lang=text|1=
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT='quiet splash'
GRUB_GFXMODE=1366x768x24
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep
}}

Be sure to run the <tt>grub2-mkconfig</tt> command to update GRUB2's boot configuration. This will instruct GRUB2 to look at the changes made to the {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} file above and output a configuration file accordingly:

{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

{{Note|For Plymouth to work as intended the proper GRUB2 video modules must also be loaded. Generally the correct video modules are loaded by default on Gentoo, so inserting additional ones is not usually needed. If frame buffer or video problems are being experienced with GRUB2, be sure to investigate missing modules as a possible culprit.}}

All done! Congratulations on creating a system with a Plymouth boot splash screen! May the splash be present always!

=== Themes ===

After emerging Plymouth a number of themes will be pulled in automatically, however more Plymouth themes can be downloaded from the web and installed manually. Extract the downloaded themes to the Plymouth theme directory: {{Path|/usr/share/plymouth/themes}}

Make sure each new theme is contained in its own folder (just like the default themes that are installed) or they will not be detected by Plymouth.

Once the themes have been extracted verify successful extraction by requesting Plymouth to generate a list of all available themes. Do this using the <tt>plymouth-set-default-theme</tt> command:

{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme --list}}

Assuming the solar theme is desired as the system's theme, run:

{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme solar}}

{{Note|The solar theme will be used for the rest of the examples in this article. Simply replace <code>solar</code> anywhere it appears with one of the other themes listed when using the <tt>plymouth-set-default-theme</tt> command to set a different theme.}}

{{Important|When using OpenRC the theme will also need to be referenced in genkernel-next's configuration file. This is outlined in the [[#OpenRC|OpenRC Configuration section]] above.}}

==== Theme creation ====

It is possible to create themes for Plymouth. See the [[Plymouth/Theme_Creation|Theme creation article]] for more information.
