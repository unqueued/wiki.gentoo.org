'''Plymouth''' is used to show splash screens during system boot and shutdown. It is a more modern alternative to [[fbsplash]] and provides flicker-free animated boot splashes with support for progress bars, solar flares, and other nifty things. In addition to [[OpenRC]], it also has full [[systemd]] support. Since it is a boot splash tool, Plymouth does not provide background eye-candy for the ttys way fbsplash does (meaning it shows no decoration on your consoles after the system has booted).

== Installation ==

{{Package|sys-boot/plymouth}} can be installed using 
{{Emerge|sys-boot/plymouth}}

{{USEflag|package=sys-boot/plymouth
|debug
|gdm
|gkt+++Adds support for x11-libs/gtk (The GIMP Toolkit)
|libkms
|pango
|static-libs
}}

== Themes ==
After emerging Plymouth a number of themes will be pulled in automatically, however you can download more Plymouth themes from the internet and install them manually. You extract newly downloaded themes to the default Plymouth directory: {{Path|/usr/share/plymouth/themes}}

Make sure each new theme is contained in its own folder (just like the default themes that are installed) or they will not be detected properly by Plymouth.

Once you have extracted your new, additional themes you can check your work by requesting Plymouth to generate a list of all available themes. Do this by using the <kbd>plymouth-set-default-theme</kbd> command:
{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme --list}}

Assuming you want to select the solar theme as the system's default theme:
{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme solar}}

{{Note|The "solar" theme will be used for the rest of the examples in this article. Simply replace "solar" anywhere it appears with the one of the other themes listed when using the <kbd>plymouth-set-default-theme</kbd> command to set a different theme.}}

{{Important|If using OpenRC you will ''also'' need to set the theme in genkernel-next's configuration. This is outlined in the [[#OpenRC Configuration|OpenRC Configuration]] section below.}}

===Theme Creation===
It is possible to create themes for Plymouth. See the [[Plymouth/Theme_Creation|Theme Creation article for more information.]]

== Kernel Configuration ==
Specific kernel options must be altered in order to get Plymouth working properly. Use the <kbd>genkernel --menuconfig all</kbd> command (or equivalent) in order to modify the kernel configuration.

It is ''highly'' advised that you '''disable''' the Linux bootup logo. On some systems it seems to cause problems.
{{KernelBox|title=This example shows the correct way to disable the Bootup logo:|1=<pre>

}}

{{Important|Be sure you enable kernel modesetting (KMS) for your respective graphics card.}}

===KMS for integrated Intel graphic cards===

         [*]     Enable modesetting on intel by default
</pre>
}}
{{Important|If this is your first time setting your on-board Intel GPU, make sure you've read the [[Intel]] article.}}

{{Important|If this is your first time setting your NVIDIA graphics card using the nouveau driver make sure you read through the [[nouveau]] article.}}

===KMS for NVIDIA graphic cards using the closed source official NVIDIA drivers===
To use the official Nvidia drivers see the wiki's [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NVidia/nvidia-drivers official NVIDIA article].
{{Note|So far the results of using official NVIDIA drivers are untested with Plymouth. Please update this section if you get it working properly.}}

==Initram Generators==
There are currently two bootloaders that have support for Plymouth. Either one will produce essentially the same result, so it is your choice as to which one you use. This article does not go into any detail at all on troubleshooting failed results, so you should probably choose the one you are more comfortable with. Using Genkernel-Next is recommended.
=== Genkernel-Next ===
====Installation====
At this point in time normal [[genkernel]] cannot create an [[initramfs]] with a Plymouth theme included. Therefore, in order to proceed, you will need to select either [[dracut]] or {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}} to build your initramfs with a Plymouth theme included. From this point onward this configuration guide will continue presuming you will be using genkernel-next since it is marked stable in the Portage tree and is essentially a drop in replacement for "normal" genkernel, however instructions for Dracut will be provided. The <code>plymouth</code> '''USE''' flag needs to be enabled in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} in order for Portage to emerge genkernel-next properly:
{{RootCmd|echo "sys-kernel/genkernel-next plymouth" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}
{{Emerge|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}}

If you are using genkernel-next you need to [[Plymouth#Init_System_Configurations|skip the Dracut section]] that immediately follows..

===Dracut===
[[Dracut]] ({{Package|sys-kernel/dracut}}) is an alternative initram generator created by the Fedora developer team. Before you read the rest of Dracut guide know this fun fact: both Plymouth and Dracut are cities in Massachusetts. Imagine that!
====Installation====
For Dracut installation instructions [[Dracut#Installation|follow this link]].

====Configure Dracut for use with Plymouth====

Add <code>plymouth</code> as a module to the {{path|/etc/dracut.conf}} file:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/dracut.conf|title=Configuring Dracut for Plymouth example|lang=bash|1=<pre>
#logfile=/var/log/dracut.log
#fileloglvl=6

# Exact list of dracut modules to use. Modules not listed here are not going
# to be included.  If you only want to add some optional modules use
# add_dracutmodules option instead.
#dracutmodules+=""

# dracut modules to omit
#omit_dracutmodules+=""

# dracut modules to add to the default
add_dracutmodules+="plymouth"
</pre>}}

{{Important|If this is your first time using Dracut, you really, ''really'' should get acquainted with it by [[Dracut|reading the Dracut article]]. Don't take the information in this small section to be all you need to know about Dracut!}}

====Generate a new initramfs using Dracut====

{{RootCmd|dracut --force}}

====Configure GRUB2 to use the Dracut generated initramfs====

{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

== Init System Configurations ==
=== OpenRC Configuration ===
Use your text editor of choice to enable Plymouth and the Plymouth theme in genkernel-next's configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/genkernel.conf|title=Configuring Genkernel for Plymouth|lang=bash|1=<pre>
# Enable splashutils in early space (initrd). Default is "no".
# SPLASH="no"

# Installs (or not if set to "no") Plymouth into the initramfs. If "splash" will be
# passed to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT at boot Plymouth will be activated.
PLYMOUTH="yes"

# Embeds the given Plymouth theme into the initramfs.
PLYMOUTH_THEME="solar"
</pre>}}

{{Warning|The <code>SPLASH</code> variable listed in the file above should be set to "no". The <code>SPLASH</code> variable configures an option for the fbsplash bootsplash loader ({{Package|media-gfx/splashutils}}) '''NOT''' Plymouth.}}

Additionally, you will need to edit {{Path|/etc/rc.conf}} to make RC non-interactive:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/rc.conf|title=RC configuration for Plymouth example|lang=bash|1=
rc_interactive=”NO”
}}

Regenerate the initramfs using the <kbd>genkernel</kbd> command:
{{RootCmd|genkernel initramfs}}

Make an update to your GRUB2 configuration to enable the splash screen during early boot. Append the options <code>quiet splash</code> to the <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> variable, adjust the resolution in the <code>GRUB_GFXMODE</code> variable to match your desired resolution for your primary screen, and set <code>GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX</code> to "keep" in order to preserve the graphics mode during the entire boot.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default/grub|title=Configuring GRUB2 for Plymouth|lang=bash|1=<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT='quiet splash'
GRUB_GFXMODE=1366x768x24
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep
</pre>}}

Finally, run the <kbd>grub2-mkconfig</kbd> command to update GRUB2's boot configuration. This will instruct GRUB2 to include the changes you made when you updated {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} file above.

{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

You are done! Congratulations on your new boot splash!

=== Systemd Configuration ===

Plymouth automatically registers itself with systemd to show a splash screen during shutdown and restart.
