'''Plymouth''' is used to show splash screens during system boot and shutdown. It is a more modern alternative to [[fbsplash]] and provides flicker-free animated boot splashes with a progress bar. It also has full [[systemd]] support. However, it does not provide eye-candy for the ttys in the way fbsplash does (meaning it shows no decoration on your consoles while the system is running).

== Installation ==

{{Package|sys-boot/plymouth}} can be installed using 
{{Emerge|sys-boot/plymouth}}

When emerging Plymouth number of themes will be pulled in automatically.

However, [[genkernel]] cannot create an [[initramfs]] with a Plymouth theme included. Therefore either [[dracut]] or {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}} will be needed. From this point onward this configuration guide will continue with genkernel-next as it is marked stable and is essentially a drop in replacement for genkernel. The "plymouth" use flag needs to be enabled in <code>/etc/portage/package.use</code>.
{{RootCmd|echo "sys-kernel/genkernel-next plymouth" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}
{{Emerge|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}}

== OpenRC Configuration ==

The first step is to select a Plymouth theme. A list of all themes can be found using
{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme --list}}

Assuming you want to select the solar theme as the default theme:
{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme solar}}

Additionally, you need to enable this theme in the genkernel-next's configuration file:
{{File|/etc/genkernel.conf|Note: the SPLASH variable should be set to "no". This variable is to set an option for the fbsplash bootsplash loader (media-gfx/splashutils) and NOT Plymouth.|<pre>
# Enable splashutils in early space (initrd). Default is "no".
# SPLASH="no"

# Installs (or not if set to "no") Plymouth into the initramfs. If "splash" will be
# passed to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT at boot Plymouth will be activated.
PLYMOUTH="yes"

# Embeds the given Plymouth theme into the initramfs.
PLYMOUTH_THEME="solar"
</pre>}}


Next, you will need to regenerate the initramfs using the <code>genkernel</code> command:
{{RootCmd|genkernel initramfs}}

Next, make an update to your Grub2 configuration to enable the splash screen during early boot. Append the options "quiet splash" on the end of the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT variable, adjust the resolution in the GRUB_GFXMODE variable to match your desired resolution for your primary screen, and set GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX to "keep" in order to preserve the graphics mode during boot.
{{File|/etc/default/grub||<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT='quiet splash'
GRUB_GFXMODE=1366x768x24
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep
</pre>}}

Finally, run the <code>grub2-mkconfig</code> command to update grub2's boot configuration. This will set grub2 to be sure to include the changes you made when you updated <code>/etc/default/grub</code> above.
{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

You are done!

== Systemd Configuration ==

Plymouth automatically registers itself with systemd to show a splash screen during shutdown/restart.
