'''Plymouth''' is used to show splash screens during system boot and shutdown. It is a more modern alternative to [[fbsplash]] and provides flicker-free animated boot splashes with a progress bar. It also has full [[systemd]] support. However, it does not provide eye-candy for the ttys in the way fbsplash does (meaning it shows no decoration on your consoles while the system is running).

== Installation ==

{{Package|sys-boot/plymouth}} can be installed using 
{{Emerge|sys-boot/plymouth}}

When emerging Plymouth number of themes will be pulled in automatically.

However, [[genkernel]] cannot create an [[initramfs]] with a plymouth theme included. Therefore either [[dracut]] or {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}} will be needed. From this point onward this configuration guide will continue with genkernel-next as it is marked stable and is essentially a drop in replacement for genkernel. The plymouth use flag needs to be enabled in <code>/etc/portage/package.use</code>.
{{RootCmd|echo "sys-kernel/genkernel-next plymouth" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}
{{Emerge|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}}

== OpenRC Configuration ==

The first step is to select a Plymouth theme. A list of all themes can be found using
{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme --list}}

Assuming you want to select the solar theme as the default theme:
{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme solar}}

Additionally, you need to enable this theme in the initramfs generation:
{{File|/etc/genkernel.conf||<pre>
# Enable splashutils in early space (initrd). Default is "no".
# SPLASH="no"

# Installs, or not, plymouth into the initramfs. If "splash" will be
# passed at boot, plymouth will be activated.
PLYMOUTH="yes"

# Embeds the given plymouth theme into the initramfs.
PLYMOUTH_THEME="solar"
</pre>}}

Note that the SPLASH variable inside <code>/etc/genkernel.conf</code> should be set to NO. This variable is to set an option for the fbsplash bootsplash loader (splashutils) and not Plymouth.

Next, you will need to regenerate the initramfs using the <code>genkernel</code> command:
{{RootCmd|genkernel all}}

Next, make an update to grub2's configuration to enable the splash during early boot. Append the options "quiet splash" on the end of the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT variable, adjust the resolution in the GRUB_GFXMODE variable to match your desired resolution for your primary screen, and set GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX to "keep" in order to preserve the graphics mode during boot.
{{File|/etc/default/grub||<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT='quiet splash'
GRUB_GFXMODE=1366x768x24
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep
</pre>}}

Finally, run the <code>grub2-mkconfig</code> command to update grub2's boot configuration to include the changes you made when you updated <code>/etc/default/grub</code> above.
{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

You are done!

== Systemd Configuration ==

Plymouth automatically registers itself with systemd to show a splash screen during shutdown/restart.
