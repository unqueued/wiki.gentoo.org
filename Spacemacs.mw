To install Spacemacs:

1. Ensure `app-editors/emacs` is listed in /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/<any file name; e.g. emacs> to use version 26.X. This might not be necessary but it is advised due to compatibility with spacemacs layers.

2. MANDATORY!!! Specify xft USE keyword for emacs. If emacs isn't built with this keyword, then rebuild it. Edit /etc/portage/package.use/<any file name; e.g. emacs> and add the line `app-editors/emacs xft`.

3. Rebuild and reinstall emacs by running... `emerge -av app-editors/emacs:26`

4. Navigate to the user's home directory `cd ~` and run `git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d`. Back up or delete ~.emacs.d/ if the directory already exists. If old settings are to be archived, backup .emacsm.

5. Run `emacs &` and follow the install prompt at the bottom of the screen.

6. After finishing the first startup process, press, ESC -> SPACE -> f -> f -> .spacemacs . The font can be changed under dotspacemacs-default-font and layers can be enabled or disabled under dotspacemacs-configuration-layers among many other options. The settings are written in lisp.
