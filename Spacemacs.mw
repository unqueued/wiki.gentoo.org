To install Spacemacs:

1. Ensure `app-editors/emacs` is listed in your accepted package file /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/<any file name; e.g. emacs> to use version 26.X. This might not be necessary but it is advised due to compatibility with spacemacs layers.

2. MANDATORY!!! Specify xft USE keyword for emacs. If emacs isn't built with this keyword, then rebuild it. Edit /etc/portage/package.use/<any file name; e.g. emacs> and add the line `/app-editors/emacs xft`.

2. Rebuild and reinstall emacs by running... `emerge -av app-editors/emacs:26`

3. Navigate to your user directory `cd ~` and run `git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d`. Back up or delete ~.emacs.d/ if the directory already exists. You may also want to backup .emacsm, too if you want to archive your old settings.

4. Run `emacs &` and follow the install prompt at the bottom of the screen. Select "evil vim" if you're cool. Else, emacs.

5. After you finish the first startup process, you can hit, ESC -> SPACE -> f -> f -> .spacemacs . Then, you can change the font under dotspacemacs-default-font and you can enable or disable layers under dotspacemacs-configuration-layers among many other options. The settings is written in lisp because the emacs developers hate you. Have fun!
