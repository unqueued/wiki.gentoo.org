== Overview ==

You have rented a whole server in a data centre somewhere and are running a few Kernel Virtual Machines (KVMs).
Your provider gives you a single IPv4 address and a IPv6 /64 subnet.
Its a nusciance to use IPv4 with non stanadard ports on the KVMs and you are too parsimonious to invest in more IPv4 addresses, its a hobby server after all.  You get a single IPv4 address and a whole IPv6 /64 subnet, since your provider cannot give you any less.

Lets put the KVMs onto IPv6 so that they have global scope IPv6 addresses.

This guide is written around the use of libvirtd 

== Prerequsites ==

: A working Gentoo host with IPv6 Support
: One or more Gentoo KVM Guests with IPv6 Support
: A IPv6 /64 prefix, like  2001:db8:dead:beef::/64
: IPv6 working on the host

IPv6 support means USE="ipv6" in make.conf, kernel IPv6 support and packages like iproute2 installed.
Other than iproute2, this is the Gentoo default.

== Getting Started ==

emerge iproute2 -pv on the hosts and KVM.

== Background ==

Your KVM setup will have created an interface called virbr0
<pre>  </ip>
  <ip family='ipv6' address='2001:db8:dead:beef:fe::' prefix='96'>
  </ip>
</pre>
Add the above three lines above the closing <pre></network></pre> tag


2001:db8::/32 â€” This prefix is used in documentation
