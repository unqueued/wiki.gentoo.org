== Introduction ==
The [[PAM]] module {{Package|sys-auth/pam_ssh_agent_auth}} allows one to use a locally installed SSH key to authenticate for {{Package|app-admin/sudo}}.
This is useful for those who aren’t happy with completely passwordless sudo, but don’t want to be typing passwords all the time.

== Installation ==
{{Emerge|pam_ssh_agent_ssh}}

== Create SSH Keys ==
Have every user that would like this capability to follow the guide on the [[SSH#Create_Keys|SSH wiki page]] and create the needed keys

== Configure ==
Configure sudo to try using public keys, then fall back to normal password authentication
{{File|/etc/pam.d/sudo||<pre>
...
auth [success=3 default=ignore] pam_ssh_agent_auth.so file=/etc/ssh/sudo_authorized_keys
auth    include     system-auth
account include     system-auth
session include     system-auth
...
</pre>}}

== Add Desired User's Public Key ==
Repeat this process for every user desired for sudo authentication
{{RootCmd|cat /home/<user>/.ssh/*.pub >> /etc/ssh/sudo_authorized_keys}}

== Extra: Launch ssh-agent upon login ==
{{Cmd|echo "ssh-add" >> ~/.bash_profile}}
