iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) is [[Article description::an IP-based network standard and a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network Storage Area Network] (SAN) protocol.]] It is used to connect clients (initiators) to host (target) storage devices. iSCSI can be helpful when transporting large amounts of data over long distances, as a multi-site backup solution, or to provide additional storage options to machines that are lacking the capacity for additional local storage.

This article acts as a portal to a set of iSCSI sub-articles:

* [[iSCSI/Initiator|iSCSI Initiator]] - An initiator is a client that connects to a target (storage machine) over the network.
* [[iSCSI/Target|iSCSI Target]] - A target is a data storage machine. It functions as a host for Initiators.

* [[NFS]] - A file system protocol that allows client machines to connect to network attached file shares. 
* [[Ceph]] - A distributed object store and filesystem designed to provide excellent performance, reliability and scalability.
* [[Tahoe-LAFS]] - A Least Authority File System.
