This guide is intended as a supplement to [[Raspberry Pi/Quick Install Guide|Install Guide]] and an alternative to [[Raspberry Pi/Kernel Compilation|Raspberry Pi Kernel]].

{{Important|This guide is accurate as of kernel 4.13 and newer, and tested on the Raspberry Pi 2 and newer.}}

=== Build tools ===
{{Emerge|sys-apps/dtc}}

=== Fetch sources ===
{{Emerge|sys-kernel/vanilla-sources}}

For the rest of this example, I will be assuming vanilla-sources-4.14.21.

{{RootCmd
|cd /usr/src/linux-4.14.21
}}

=== Configure the kernel === 
==== Raspberry Pi 2 ====
{{RootCmd
|make multi_v7_defconfig
}}

Note: multi_v7_defconfig will enable more than you need, but it is currently the most appropriate included defconfig to choose from.

==== Raspberry Pi 3 (32 bit) ====
{{RootCmd
|make multi_v7_defconfig
}}

Note: multi_v7_defconfig will enable more than you need, but it is currently the most appropriate included defconfig to choose from.

=== Build the kernel ===
{{Important|If you're not building this on an armv7 machine / VM see [[cross build environment]] and adjust the instructions as necessary.}}
{{Important|Ensure you've mounted your /boot partition before running the install phase.}}
{{RootCmd
|make
|make zinstall modules_install dtbs_install
}}

=== Configuring bootloader ===
Contrary to popular belief, you don't need u-boot to boot the mainline kernel, just populate the appropriate required files:

==== Raspberry Pi 2 ====
{{FileBox|filename=/boot/config.txt|1=
kernel=vmlinuz-4.14.21
device_tree=dtbs/4.14.21/bcm2836-rpi-2-b.dtb
avoid_warnings=2
}}

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/cmdline.txt|1=
root=/dev/mmcblk0p3 rw rootwait elevator=noop cma=256M@512M
}}

You can specify the root as a device or via PARTUUID, just ensure it's accurate for your system.

==== Raspberry Pi 3 (32 bit) ====
{{FileBox|filename=/boot/config.txt|1=
kernel=vmlinuz-4.14.21
device_tree=dtbs/4.14.21/bcm2837-rpi-3-b.dtb
avoid_warnings=2
}}

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/cmdline.txt|1=
root=/dev/mmcblk0p3 rw rootwait elevator=noop cma=256M@512M
}}

You can specify the root as a device or via PARTUUID, just ensure it's accurate for your system.

=== Installing firmware ===

Finally, until [https://github.com/christinaa/rpi-open-firmware rpi-open-firmware] is ready, you'll need to copy the following binary blobs from [https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot raspberrypi-firmware] to your /boot partition.

* bootcode.bin
* start.elf
* fixup_*.dat
* start_*.bin
