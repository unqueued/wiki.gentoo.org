'''dwm''' is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, monocle and floating layouts. All of the layouts can be applied dynamically, optimising the environment for the application in use and the task performed.

* dwm is only a single binary, and its source code is intended to never exceed 2000 SLOC.
* dwm is customized through editing its source code

More details concerning dwm can be found on the dwm Homepage.


{{Note| dwm information from [http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Dwm gentoo-wiki DWM] still needs importing!}}


== Installation ==
For most users, this is the install method you want.

Preferably, you'll want to enable USE flag "savedconfig" and save your customized configuration file to "/etc/portage/savedconfig//x11-wm/dwm-6.0.h" for your later editing pleasure.
{{RootCmd|euse --enable savedconfig}}


If you have multiple monitors, you should also enable the "xinerama" USE flag regardless of whether or not you're using Xinerama.
{{RootCmd|euse --enable xinerama}}


Compile or install dwm:
{{Emerge|x11-wm/dwm}}


== Configuration ==

=== Main dwm Configuration File (dwm.h file) ===
As stated previously, the main dwm configuration file is the "/etc/portage/savedconfig//x11-wm/dwm-6.0" file and after each change, dwm needs to be recompiled for any changes to take effect.

So you're editor may use syntax hilighting feature for C code create a symlink using a header filename.
{{RootCmd|ln -s /etc/portage/savedconfig//x11-wm/dwm-6.0 /etc/portage/savedconfig//x11-wm/dwm-6.0.h}}

(If you're already within a dwm session and just recompiled dwm, use the META + SHIFT + q key sequence for reloading the dwm binary currently executing within memory.)

=== startx configuration file (xinitrc file) ===
The preferred method of starting dwm is by way of $HOME/.xinitrc:
{{File|$HOME/.xinitrc||
exec dwm }}

Using this method, users can pipe other commands such as Conky and IMWheel through this instance of dwm process.

=== Settings File (dwm.rc) ===
The default xsession file provided by the Gentoo Ebuild (/etc/X11/Sessions/dwm) provides for a default status box that displays system load and the date/time or whatever shell code the user creates at ~/.dwm/dwmrc. The present mechanism (as of dwm-6.0) for sending text to a status box in the window manager's bar is to use 'xsetroot', as illustrated by the default xsession mentioned above. With a few lines of shell code, one can use this mechanism to send arbitrary text to the status bar (for example, your CPU temperature, the current track on your music player, number of unread emails, etc.)

== Starting dwm ==
{{Note|The following mentioned files are ignored by DWM: $HOME/.profile, $HOME/.xprofile, $HOME/.config are only used by Display Managers and/or other mainstream Window Managers. If your shell is Bash, the only files read on login will be $HOME/.bash_profile, then $HOME/.xinitrc on startx, then $HOME/.dwm/dwmrc when DWM starts.}}

=== Using commandline startx (xinitrc) ===
If using the above xinitrc, use startx after logging in.

=== Using a Display Manager ===
(Any users using a display manager for logging into a dwm desktop?)

== Additional Features ==
=== dmenu ===
dmenu is a dynamic menu for X, originally designed for dwm.
{{Emerge|x11-misc/dmenu}}
=== Conky ===
For displaying additional status information on dwm's menu bar.&nbsp; Prefer installing with "-X" USE flag as only text information is piped through to the dwm instance.&nbsp; (USE flags for consideration are "-X hddtemp iostats wifi".)
{{Emerge|app-admin/conky}}

== Problems ==

* Upgrading from dwm-5.9 to dwm-6.0 incorporated many changes making your previous config.h a likely problem for compiling dwm-6.0.&nbsp; Likely problems displayed might be compiler error messages "[nowiki]'nmaster' undeclared[/nowiki]".&nbsp; To resolve, compile and install dwm-6.0 without using your custom config.h file and then find the default dwm-6.0 config.h file and diff against your old config.h file.&nbsp; (Or, uncompress the dwm-6.0 tarball to acquire the default dwm-6.0 config.h file.)

* If you have conflicts with the default DWM ALT key conflicting with your other console interface applications, you can use the ESC key while within your console application. The ESC key is an immediate usable fall back escape key. Another option, redefine the META key to use the keyboard "Windows Key" or other additional keys near the space bar.
