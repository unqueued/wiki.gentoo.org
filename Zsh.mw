Zsh (the Z shell) is an interactive login shell that can also be used as a powerful scripting language interpreter. It is similar to the Bourne shell and the Korn shell, but offers extensive configurability, powerful commandline completion, file globbing, and spelling correction.

== Installing zsh ==
To install {{Package|app-shells/zsh}} use the following command:
{{emerge|app-shells/zsh|app-shells/zsh-completion}}
{{Package|app-shells/zsh-completion}} is optional, but enables auto-completion for arguments of commands, which is one of the strengths of zsh.
{{Note|To enable 'zsh-completion' globally for every program, add it to your USE flags in {{Path|/etc/make.conf}}}}

=== USE flags ===
{{USEflag
|caps
|debug++no+
|doc
|examples++yes++
|gdbm
|maildir
|pcre
|static
|unicode++yes+
}}

== Configuring zsh ==
Upon running zsh for the first time as a new user, you will be greeted by a basic configuration dialog. You can skip this by pressing "q" to configure zsh manually.
To make zsh your default shell, you can run:
{{Cmd|chsh -s /bin/zsh}}
Zsh's main configuration file is {{Path|~/.zshrc}} and you can reload this configuration in a running shell with:
{{Cmd|source ~/.zshrc}}
