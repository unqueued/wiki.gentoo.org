{{c|zsh}} ('''Z sh'''ell) is [[Article description::an interactive login shell that can also be used as a powerful scripting language interpreter.]] It is similar to [[bash]] and the Korn shell, but offers extensive configurability, powerful command-line completion, file globbing, and spelling correction.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-shells/zsh}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-shells/zsh}}:

{{Emerge|app-shells/zsh}}

=== Add-ons ===

==== app-shells/zsh-completions ====

Emerging {{Package|app-shells/zsh-completions}} enables auto-completion for arguments of commands, which is one of the advantages {{c|zsh}} has over other shells:

{{Emerge|app-shells/zsh-completions}}

{{Note|To enable auto-completion globally (for most programs), add 'zsh-completion' to the <code>USE</code> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}}}

==== app-shells/gentoo-zsh-completions ====

Emerging {{Package|app-shells/gentoo-zsh-completions}} enables Gentoo specific auto-completion for arguments of Portage and other Gentoo commands:

{{Emerge|app-shells/gentoo-zsh-completions}}

When installing this package be sure to add the following to the respective {{Path|~/.zshrc}} files:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.zshrc|title=Enabling Portage completions and Gentoo prompt for {{c|zsh}}|1=
autoload -U compinit promptinit
compinit
promptinit; prompt gentoo
}}

To enable a cache for the completions add:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.zshrc|title=Enabling Portage completions and Gentoo prompt for {{c|zsh}}|1=
zstyle ':completion::complete:*' use-cache 1
}}

== Configuration ==

=== Invocation ===

{{Cmd|zsh}}

Upon running {{c|zsh}} for the first time as a new user, you will be greeted by a basic configuration dialog. The setup process can be skipped by pressing {{Key|q}}. If the setup process is skipped {{c|zsh}} can be setup manually.

=== Setting {{c|zsh}} as the default shell ===

To make {{c|zsh}} the default shell for a user, run:

{{Cmd|chsh -s /bin/zsh}}

=== File ===

{{c|zsh}}'s main configuration file is located in each user's home directory at {{Path|~/.zshrc}}. Reload this file in running shells for the changes to take effect:

{{Cmd|source ~/.zshrc}}

{{Note|Reloading via the {{c|source}} command is only necessary when instances of {{c|zsh}} are already in memory ''after'' changes are made to the shell's configuration file.}}

=== oh-my-zsh ===

The zsh community created numerous tweaks, the easiest way to acquire them is to install [https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh oh-my-zsh] framework. It contains handy plugins and eye [https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes candy themes], and makes their configuration very easy. However you should always consider the security risk involving running code outside of Gentoo developers jurisdiction.
