'''Zsh''' ('''Z sh'''ell) is an interactive login shell that can also be used as a powerful scripting language interpreter. It is similar to [[bash]] and the Korn shell, but offers extensive configurability, powerful commandline completion, file globbing, and spelling correction.

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|app-shells/zsh}}:
{{USEflag
|caps
|debug++no
|doc
|examples++yes
|gdbm
|maildir
|pcre
|static
|unicode++yes
}}
{{Emerge|zsh}}

Also install {{Package|app-shells/zsh-completion}}, which is optional, but enables auto-completion for arguments of commands, which is one of the strengths of Zsh:
{{Emerge|zsh-completion}}
{{Note|To enable 'zsh-completion' globally for every program, add it to your USE flags in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}}}

== Configuration ==
Upon running Zsh for the first time as a new user, you will be greeted by a basic configuration dialog. You can skip this by pressing {{Key|q}} to configure Zsh manually.

To make Zsh your default shell, you can run:
{{Cmd|chsh -s /bin/zsh}}

Zsh's main configuration file is {{Path|~/.zshrc}} and you can reload this configuration in a running shell with:
{{Cmd|source ~/.zshrc}}
