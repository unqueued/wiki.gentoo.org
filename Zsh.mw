<tt>zsh</tt> ('''Z sh'''ell) is an interactive login shell that can also be used as a powerful scripting language interpreter. It is similar to [[bash]] and the Korn shell, but offers extensive configurability, powerful command-line completion, file globbing, and spelling correction.

=== Add-ons ===

==== app-shells/zsh-completion ====

Emerging {{Package|app-shells/zsh-completion}} enables auto-completion for arguments of commands, which is one of the advantages <tt>zsh</tt> has over other shells:

{{Emerge|app-shells/zsh-completion}}

{{Note|To enable 'zsh-completion' globally (for most programs), add it to the <code>USE</code> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}}}

==== app-shells/gentoo-zsh-completions ====

Emerging {{Package|app-shells/gentoo-zsh-completions}} enables Gentoo specific auto-completion for arguments of Portage and other Gentoo commands:

{{Emerge|app-shells/zsh-completion}}

When installing this package be sure to add the following to the respective {{Path|~/.zshrc}} files:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.zshrc|title=Enabling Portage completions and Gentoo prompt for <tt>zsh</tt>|1=
autoload -U compinit promptinit
compinit
promptinit; prompt gentoo
}}

To enable a cache for the completions add:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.zshrc|title=Enabling Portage completions and Gentoo prompt for <tt>zsh</tt>|1=
zstyle ':completion::complete:*' use-cache 1
}}

== Configuration ==

=== Invocation ===

{{Cmd|zsh}}

Upon running <tt>zsh</tt> for the first time as a new user, you will be greeted by a basic configuration dialog. The setup process can be skipped by pressing {{Key|q}}. If the setup process is skipped <tt>zsh</tt> can be setup manually.

=== Setting <tt>zsh</tt> as the default shell ===

To make <tt>zsh</tt> the default shell for a user, run:

{{Cmd|chsh -s /bin/zsh}}

=== File ===

<tt>zsh</tt>'s main configuration file is located in each user's home directory at {{Path|~/.zshrc}}. Reload this file in running shells for the changes to take effect:

{{Cmd|source ~/.zshrc}}

{{Note|Reloading via the <tt>source</tt> command is only necessary when instances of <tt>zsh</tt> are already in memory ''after'' changes are made to the shell's configuration file.}}
