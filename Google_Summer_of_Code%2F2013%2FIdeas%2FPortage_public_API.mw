{{GSoCIdea2013
|Portage public API|
<!-- Description goes here: -->This is a continuation of a project from a previous year.  The aim is to complete the creation of a stable api for consumer app use.  The api will be fully capable of performing merges, unmerges, getting dependency graphs, etc..
An additional task is to provide a c interface lib that connects to the python api functions and classes.  This allows further use of the api for c, c++ based applications and portage frontends.  

{{Note|This project in its current form is not suitable for a complete SoC project. If you wish to work on this, you should expand the scope of the work significantly.  One possibility is to include the Tags support for Portage project.}}
