|Portage public API|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
This is a continuation of a project from a previous year.  The aim is to complete the creation of a stable api for consumer app use.  The api will be fully capable of performing merges, unmerges, getting dependency graphs, etc..
An additional task is to provide a c interface lib that connects to the python api functions and classes.  This allows further use of the api for c, c++ based applications and portage frontends.
