This article is based on a [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-965190.html posting in the Gentoo Forums] and [[Article description::explains how to use dhcpcd for complete network stack management]].

== Setup ==

Make sure [[Dhcpcd|dhcpcd]] is installed. Next, add it to the default runlevel and start the service:

{{RootCmd
|rc-update add dhcpcd default
|/etc/init.d/dhcpcd start
}}

This setup deviates from the default networking instructions in the Gentoo Handbook. It has the advantage that it provides automatic switching between wired and wireless network interfaces.

== Wireless ==

For wireless, [[wpa_supplicant]] should be used. Create the configuration file if it does not exist.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf|lang=ini|1=# Allow users in the 'wheel' group to control wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=wheel

# Make this file writable for wpa_gui / wpa_cli
update_config=1}}

{{:Wpa_supplicant/Setup_for_dhcpcd_as_network_manager}}

== Testing ==

Stop the {{c|dhcpcd}} service, then start {{c|dhcpcd}} with the -d (<var>--debug</var>) and -B (<var>--nobackground</var>) options enabled to see it starting the connection.

</pre>}}

== Static IP address ==

In case the network interface card should be configured with a [[Static_Routing|static IP address]], type it into the [[dhcpcd-ui#Usage|graphical user interface]]. Without the [[dhcpcd-ui#Usage|graphical user interface]], entries can also be [http://roy.marples.name/man/html5/dhcpcd.conf.html manually added] (currently offline) to {{Path|/etc/dhcpcd.conf}} as described in [[Dhcpcd#Static_IP_addresses]].

== Migration from Gentoo net.* scripts ==

When migrating from [[netifrc|Gentoo's net.* scripts]] it is essential to remove the {{Path|net.*}} scripts from the runlevels.

{{Cmd|rc-config list {{!}} grep 'wpa_supplicant\{{!}}dhcpcd\{{!}}net.'|output=<pre>
  net.wlp8s0                default
  dhcpcd                    default</pre>}}

Any match starting with <code>net.</code> must not have a runlevel assigned. In the above example, {{Path|net.wlp8s0}} needs to be removed.

{{RootCmd|rc-update del net.wlp8s0
|/etc/init.d/net.wlp8s0 stop}}

Once the network setup works well, it is possible to completely remove the old Gentoo {{Path|net.*}} scripts. To do so, disable the <code>netifrc</code> USE flag, re-emerge {{Package|sys-apps/openrc}} and finally unmerge {{Package|net-misc/netifrc}}:

{{RootCmd|echo 'sys-apps/openrc -netifrc' >> /etc/portage/package.use
|emerge --ask --newuse --oneshot sys-apps/openrc
|emerge --ask --verbose --depclean net-misc/netifrc}}

Also the old configuration files and symlinks can be removed:

{{RootCmd|rm /etc/conf.d/net
|rm /etc/init.d/net.*}}

== Network dependent services ==

Manipulating [[Network_dependent_services|network dependent services]] by {{c|dhcpcd}} is no longer supported since openrc-0.16.4.

== Graphical User interface ==

A [[dhcpcd-ui|dhcpcd graphical user interface]] is provided by {{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd-ui}}.
