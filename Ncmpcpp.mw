{{Note|Ncmpcpp cannot play music by itself, MPD<ref>https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/MPD<pre>MPD is required to be installed locally or on the remote server you will be connecting to with ncmpcpp.</pre></ref> is required to be installed locally or on the remote server you will be connecting to with ncmpcpp.}}

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=media-sound/ncmpcpp}}

=== Emerge ===
{{Emerge|media-sound/ncmpcpp}}


== Configuration ==

After installation the user should make a .ncmpcpp directory within the /home/''user'' directory. This is where ncmpcpp will read the configuration file and output any error messages.

{{RootCmd|mkdir .ncmpcpp && touch .ncmpcpp/config}}

=== Basic Configuration ===

Below is an example of a basic ncmpcpp config file.

{{FileBox|filename=.ncmpcpp/config|1=
ncmpcpp_directory =         "~/.ncmpcpp"
mpd_host =                  "127.0.0.1"
mpd_port =                  "6600"
mpd_music_dir =	            "/var/lib/mpd/music/"
}}
