{{c|ncmpcpp}} ('''N'''Curses '''M'''usic '''P'''layer '''C'''lient '''P'''lus '''P'''lus) is a {{Package|sys-libs/ncurses}} based MPD ('''M'''usic '''P'''layer '''D'''aemon) client similar to {{c|ncmpc}}, with some new and improved features. 

== Installation ==

{{Note|Ncmpcpp cannot play music by itself. The [[MPD]] backend is required to be installed locally (or on the remote server) which will be managed using the ncmpcpp frontend.}}

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=media-sound/ncmpcpp}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|media-sound/ncmpcpp}}

== Configuration ==

=== Local ===

After installation the user should make a {{Path|.ncmpcpp}} directory within their specific {{Path|/home}} directory. This is where ncmpcpp will read the configuration file and output any error messages.

{{RootCmd|mkdir ~/.ncmpcpp && touch ~/.ncmpcpp/config}}

Below is an example of a local user's ncmpcpp configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.ncmpcpp/config|lang=ini|1=
ncmpcpp_directory =         "~/.ncmpcpp"
mpd_host =                  "127.0.0.1"
mpd_port =                  "6600"
mpd_music_dir =	            "/var/lib/mpd/music/"
}}
