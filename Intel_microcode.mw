== Installation ==

{{Note|The microcode-ctl utility has been deprecated as of version 1.28-r1(Gentoo unstable)<ref>https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=719cc5ef240b766953ddbe1e7a6593f8091eed12 The microcode-ctl utility has been deprecated as of version 1.28-r1(Gentoo unstable) and no longer contains the init script. It also does not work on certain CPUs such as Intel Haswells.</ref> and no longer contains the init script. It also does not work on certain CPUs such as Intel Haswells, you should switch to the "Early microcode" method explained directly below. If however you wish to continue using microcode-ctl please skip to the "Microcode-ctl" section near the bottom of this page.}}

=== Kernel ===

You need to activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD, CONFIG_MICROCODE, and CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL|<pre>
General setup  --->
    [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
Processor type and features  --->
    <*> CPU microcode loading support
    [*]   Intel microcode loading support
</pre>}}

{{Note|Modules don't work for early microcode, so make sure microcode loading is built-in.}}

=== Software ===

You can now install the microcode {{Package|sys-firmware/intel-microcode}}

{{Emerge|intel-microcode}}

And a tool to manipulate it {{Package|sys-apps/iucode_tool}}

{{Emerge|iucode_tool}}


== Configuration ==

After emerging {{Package|sys-firmware/intel-microcode}}, generate the microcode cpio archive using {{Package|sys-apps/iucode_tool}}:

{{RootCmd|1=iucode_tool -S --write-earlyfw=/boot/early_ucode.cpio /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/*|output=<pre>
iucode_tool: system has processor(s) with signature 0x000306c3
iucode_tool: Writing selected microcodes to: /boot/early_ucode.cpio
</pre>}}

=== Grub 1.x ===
Add the generated microcode to your kernel command line as an '''initrd''' parameter (this should be done even if you don't use an initrd image in order to boot, the microcode update merely leverages the initrd hooks):
{{FileBox|filename=/boot/grub/grub.conf|lang=text|1=
title Gentoo Linux 4.4.6
root (hd0,0)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.6-gentoo root=/dev/sda3
initrd early_ucode.cpio}}

=== Grub 2.x ===

Change this small section of {{Path|/etc/grub.d/10_linux}} from:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/grub.d/10_linux|title=Before|lang=bash|1=
  initrd=
  for i in "initrd.img-${version}" "initrd-${version}.img" "initrd-${version}.gz" \
           "initrd-${version}" "initramfs-${version}.img" \
           "initrd.img-${alt_version}" "initrd-${alt_version}.img" \
           "initrd-${alt_version}" "initramfs-${alt_version}.img" \
           "initramfs-genkernel-${version}" \
           "initramfs-genkernel-${alt_version}" \
           "initramfs-genkernel-${GENKERNEL_ARCH}-${version}" \
           "initramfs-genkernel-${GENKERNEL_ARCH}-${alt_version}"; do
    if test -e "${dirname}/${i}" ; then
      initrd="$i"
      break
    fi
  done
}}

To this:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/grub.d/10_linux|title=After|lang=bash|1=
  initrd=
  for i in "initrd.img-${version}" "initrd-${version}.img" "initrd-${version}.gz" \
           "initrd-${version}" "initramfs-${version}.img" \
           "initrd.img-${alt_version}" "initrd-${alt_version}.img" \
           "initrd-${alt_version}" "initramfs-${alt_version}.img" \
           "initramfs-genkernel-${version}" \
           "initramfs-genkernel-${alt_version}" \
           "initramfs-genkernel-${GENKERNEL_ARCH}-${version}" \
           "initramfs-genkernel-${GENKERNEL_ARCH}-${alt_version}"; do
    if test -e "${dirname}/${i}" ; then
      initrd="early_ucode.cpio ${rel_dirname}/$i"
      break
    else
      initrd="early_ucode.cpio"
    fi
  done
}}

{{Note|This is the most pain-free method I've found to load the microcode, works with or without an initramfs.}}

{{Warning|If you were not using an initrd before, make sure to [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7914208.html specify the root partition by name instead of UUID]. The root partition name can be specified directly in GRUB menu or by editing <code>grub.cfg</code>}}

Regenerate your {{Path|grub.cfg}} with:

{{RootCmd|1=grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg|output=<pre>
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-4.6.3-gentoo
Found initrd image: /boot/early_ucode.cpio /initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-4.6.3-gentoo
done
</pre>}}

{{Note|This is similar to what you should see, minus the initramfs if you do not have one.}}
Reboot and you're all done.

== Verification ==

Here is an example of a CPU with no available microcode updates or the system was not configued to load them properly:

{{RootCmd|1=dmesg {{!}} grep microcode|output=<pre>
[    1.196567] microcode: CPU0 sig=0x6fd, pf=0x80, revision=0xa3
[    1.196575] microcode: CPU1 sig=0x6fd, pf=0x80, revision=0xa3
[    1.196623] microcode: Microcode Update Driver: v2.01 <tigran@aivazian.fsnet.co.uk>, Peter Oruba
</pre>}}

Here is the same CPU but with microcode updates being applied successfully:

{{RootCmd|1=dmesg {{!}} grep microcode|output=<pre>
[    0.000000] microcode: microcode updated early to revision 0xa4, date = 2010-10-02
[    1.207385] microcode: CPU0 sig=0x6fd, pf=0x80, revision=0xa4
[    1.207393] microcode: CPU1 sig=0x6fd, pf=0x80, revision=0xa4
[    1.207445] microcode: Microcode Update Driver: v2.01 <tigran@aivazian.fsnet.co.uk>, Peter Oruba
</pre>}}


== Microcode-ctl ==

{{Note|The microcode-ctl utility has been deprecated as of 1.28-r1 (Gentoo unstable) and will no longer contain the init script. It also does not work on certain CPUs such as Intel Haswells, the information below this point is only relevant to microcode-ctl users.}}

=== Kernel ===

You need to activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable CONFIG_MICROCODE and CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL|<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    <M> CPU microcode loading support
    [*]   Intel microcode loading support
</pre>}}

{{Note|If you build it as module, it will automatically get loaded as needed and then unloaded after microcode update saving some memory.}}

=== Software ===

You can now install {{Package|sys-apps/microcode-ctl}}:

{{Emerge|microcode-ctl}}

=== OpenRC ===

You can now start microcode-ctl:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/microcode_ctl start}}

To start microcode-ctl at boot time, add it your boot runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add microcode_ctl boot}}

{{Note|Using boot runlevel ensures the CPU is updated as soon as possible.}}

=== systemd ===
See: [[Systemd]]. Simply make sure that the Microcode loader is set as a module in the kernel configuration as noted above.  You don't need to add a service or do anything else.

== New method without initram-fs/disk ==

{{Note|This method should be preferable, especially for EFI-Stub systems (some motherboard firmware might have issues with parsing/passing custom boot command line options), since these changes are less likely to leave your system unbootable (and possibly unrepairable without an EFI compatible rescue disk which can be very tricky on headless machines) the way a broken firmware boot entry and/or incorrect initram-fs/disk would, while it also works on BIOS systems or EFI systems with custom bootloaders on disk. However, this requires a relatively recent kernel version (possibly unstable at the time of writing). It was tested with Linux 4.8.0}}

=== Software ===

You can install the officially published microcode package and let it automatically processed by {{Package|sys-firmware/intel-microcode}}
{{Emerge|intel-microcode}}

{{Note|Save the output of this command or make sure it's logged in a file you can find and access (you will need that long list of microcode files with their matching signatures in the next step).}}

And you can use this tool to identify your actual CPU signature(s) {{Package|sys-apps/iucode_tool}}

{{Emerge|iucode_tool}}

{{RootCmd|1=iucode_tool -S|output=<pre>
iucode_tool: system has processor(s) with signature 0x000306c3
</pre>}}

To find the appropriate filename(s) for the listed signature(s) usi:

{{RootCmd|1=iucode_tool -S -l /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/*|output=<pre>
iucode_tool: system has processor(s) with signature 0x000306c3
[...]
microcode bundle 49: /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/06-3c-03
[...]
selected microcodes:
  049/001: sig 0x000306c3, pf_mask 0x32, 2017-01-27, rev 0x0022, size 22528
</pre>}}

The signature found in the ''microcode bundle '''49''''', so the filename to use is ''intel-ucode/06-3c-03''

=== Kernel ===

You need tho enable and configure the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable CONFIG_MICROCODE and CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL|<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    <*> CPU microcode loading support
    [*]   Intel microcode loading support

Device Drivers  --->
  Generic Driver Options  --->
    [*]   Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
    (intel-ucode/06-3c-03) External firmware blobs to build into the kernel binary
    (/lib/firmware/) Firmware blobs root directory
</pre>}}

{{Note|These should be built-in, not loadable external modules and the filename and directory (obviously) needs to be set according to where you placed the microcode file(s) for your specific CPU(s). In this example (for a i7-4790K CPU), the relevant filename was 06-3c-03 (the location was the system default) for the signature 0x000306c3.}}

Rebuild and install your kernel the same way you normally would.

== Verification ==

After the next reboot, you should see something like this:

{{RootCmd|1=dmesg {{!}} grep microcode|output=<pre>
[    0.000000] microcode: microcode updated early to revision 0x22, date = 2017-01-27
[    1.153262] microcode: sig=0x306c3, pf=0x2, revision=0x22
[    1.153815] microcode: Microcode Update Driver: v2.2.
</pre>}}

{{Note|Note how this is the very fist step the kernel logs now.}}

{{Note|Be aware that injecting the microcode update directly into the motherboard firmware (which might sounds tempting) might result in CPU0 being updated but the rest of the CPUs (or CPU cores in a multi-core system) being left at their initial revision (which might cause more problems than running them all at the same initial version). And, since most stock motherboard firmwares have some microcode updates (even in their initial release versions), it's probably a good enough reason for everybody to make sure their kernel tries to update all CPUs (and cores) to the same version (so, let this update driver running even if the kernel has the same version which is stored in the motherboard firmware). Injecting the microcode into the firmware might be desirable still (to make sure it's loaded for the boot CPU before the kernel is loaded and able to update the rest of the microcodes).}}
