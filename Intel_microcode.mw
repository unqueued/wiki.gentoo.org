This article describes the setup of microcode-ctl to update the microcode of Intel processors.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel|Enable CONFIG_MICROCODE and CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL|<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    <M> CPU microcode loading support
    [*]   Intel microcode loading support
</pre>}}

{{Note|If you build it as module, it will automatically get loaded as needed and then unloaded after microcode update saving some memory.}}

=== Software ===
You can now install {{Package|sys-apps/microcode-ctl}}:
{{Emerge|microcode-ctl}}

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===
You can now start microcode-ctl:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/microcode_ctl start}}
To start microcode-ctl at boot time, add it your boot runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add microcode_ctl boot}}
{{Note|Using boot runlevel ensures the CPU is updated as soon as possible.}}
