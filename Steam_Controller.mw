The [[Steam]] Controller is a game controller developed by [[Wikipedia:Valve_Corporation|Valve]], which features two trackpads (in place of thumbsticks) with [[Wikipedia:Haptic_technology|haptic]] feedback, and sixteen buttons. The Steam controller is designed not only for games supporting traditional controllers, but also for games that support keyboard and mouse.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

The Steam Controller is fully supported by Linux without the need for a specific device driver, however it does require [[USB]] and user level driver support.

            [*]   Miscellaneous devices --->
                    <*>   User level driver support
}}

=== Permissions ===

If Steam was installed [[Steam#Manual|manually]] or from an [[Steam#Overlay|overlay]], and [[ConsoleKit]] or [[systemd]] is ''not'' being used, create the following [[udev]] rules file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller-perms.rules|1=
# Valve USB devices
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666"
# Steam Controller udev write access
KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"
# HTC Vive HID Sensor naming and permissioning
KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0bb4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2c87", MODE="0666"
}}

The above udev rule will only grant access to the Steam Controller for users in the {{c|input}} group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <user> input}}

If Steam was installed manually and ConsoleKit or systemd ''is'' being used, create the following udev rules file:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller-perms.rules|1=
# Valve USB devices
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666"
# Steam Controller udev write access
KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl"
# HTC Vive HID Sensor naming and permissioning
KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0bb4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2c87", MODE="0666"
}}

The above udev rule will automatically grant access (via ACLs) to the Steam Controller for logged in users.

If Steam was installed from an [[Steam#Overlay|overlay]], a udev rules file that supports ConsoleKit and systemd should already be installed.

{{Note|If ConsoleKit or systemd is being used, set the <var>USE</var> variable to <code>acl</code> to have access granted automatically to the Steam Controller.}}

Next, reload the udev rules files and trigger a device event for the new rule:

{{RootCmd
|udevadm control --reload
|udevadm trigger
}}

Once the udev rules files are reloaded, the user using the Steam Controller will need to log out/in for the correct permissions to be applied.
