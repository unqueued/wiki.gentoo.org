The [[Steam]] Controller is [[Article description::a game controller developed by [[Wikipedia:Valve_Corporation|Valve]].]] It features two trackpads (in place of thumbsticks) with [[Wikipedia:Haptic_technology|haptic]] feedback and sixteen buttons. The Steam controller is designed not only for games supporting traditional controllers, but also for games that support keyboard and mouse.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

The Steam Controller is fully supported by Linux without the need for a specific device driver, however it does require [[USB]] and user level driver support.

          Input device support --->
            [*] Generic input layer (needed for keyboard, mouse,...)
            [*]   Miscellaneous devices --->
                    <*>   User level driver support
}}

=== Permissions ===

If Steam was installed [[Steam#Manual|manually]] or from an [[Steam#Overlay|overlay]], and [[ConsoleKit]] or [[systemd]] is ''not'' being used, create the following [[udev]] rules file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller-perms.rules|1=
# Valve USB devices
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666"
# Steam Controller udev write access
KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"

# Valve HID devices over USB hidraw
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666"

# Valve HID devices over bluetooth hidraw
KERNEL=="hidraw*", KERNELS=="*28DE:*", MODE="0666"
}}

The above udev rules file will grant access to the Steam Controller for users in the {{c|input}} group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <user> input}}

If Steam was installed manually and ConsoleKit or systemd ''is'' being used, create the following udev rules file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller-perms.rules|1=
# Valve USB devices
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666"
# Steam Controller udev write access
KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="udev-acl"

# Valve HID devices over USB hidraw
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666"

# Valve HID devices over bluetooth hidraw
KERNEL=="hidraw*", KERNELS=="*28DE:*", MODE="0666"
}}

The above udev rules file will grant access to the Steam Controller by automatically setting an [[Filesystem/Access_Control_List_Guide|ACL]] entry for the logged-in user.

If Steam was installed from anyc's Steam [[Steam#Overlay|overlay]], a udev rules file that supports ConsoleKit and systemd should already be installed with the {{c|steam-launcher-1.0.0.51-r1}} ebuild.

{{Note|If ConsoleKit or systemd is being used, set the <var>USE</var> variable to <code>acl</code> to have the ACL entry set for the logged-in user.}}

Next, reload the udev rules files and trigger a device event for the new rule:

{{RootCmd
|udevadm control --reload
|udevadm trigger
}}

Once the udev rules files are reloaded, the user using the Steam Controller will need to log out/in for the correct permissions to be set.
