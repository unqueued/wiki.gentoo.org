The [[Steam]] Controller is a game controller developed by [[Wikipedia:Valve_Corporation|Valve]], which features two trackpads (in place of thumbsticks) with [[Wikipedia:Haptic_technology|haptic]] feedback, and sixteen buttons. The Steam controller is designed not only for games supporting traditional controllers, but also for games that support keyboard and mouse.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

The Steam Controller is fully supported by Linux without the need for a specific device driver, however it does require [[USB]] and user level driver support.

                    <*>   User level driver support
}}

=== Permissions ===

If Steam was installed [[Steam#Manual|manually]] and systemd is ''not'' installed, create the following [[udev]] rules file<ref>Pierre-Loup. [http://steamcommunity.com/app/353370/discussions/0/490123197956024380 Steam Controller known issues and platform-specific notes], [http://steamcommunity.com/app/353370 Steam Controller Steam Community], October 19th, 2015. Retrieved on December 24th, 2015.</ref>:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller-perms.rules|1=
# Valve USB devices
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666"
# Steam Controller udev write access
KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"
# HTC Vive HID Sensor naming and permissioning
KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0bb4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2c87", MODE="0666"
}}

The above udev rule will only grant access to the Steam Controller for users in the {{c|input}} group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <user> input}}

If Steam was installed manually and systemd ''is'' installed, the upstream udev rules file should be used:

{{RootCmd
|wget http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/archive/precise/steam_latest.tar.gz
|tar -xvzf steam_latest.tar.gz -C /etc/udev/rules.d --strip-components{{=}}4 steam/lib/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller-perms.rules
}}

Next, reload the udev rules files and trigger a device event for the new rule:

{{RootCmd
|udevadm control --reload
|udevadm trigger
}}

If Steam was installed from an [[Steam#Overlay|overlay]], the upstream udev rules file should already be installed.

{{Note|The upstream udev rules file installed from an overlay will only partially work ''without'' systemd installed. There is an open [https://github.com/anyc/steam-overlay/issues/157 issue] on anyc's Steam overlay.}}

Once the udev rules files are reloaded, the user using the Steam Controller will need log out/in for the correct ownership and permissions to be set.
