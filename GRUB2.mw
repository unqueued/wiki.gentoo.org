{{Warning|GRUB2 GRUB2 is in development but still quite stable if I may say aside from some weird issues as the infamous `invalid signature' and thus rightly masked in portage.}}
== Introduction ==
GRUB2 is next generation, a complete rewrite, of GRUB LEGACY popular GNU/Linux boot loader. The new version has a new shell like syntax which permit advanced scripting capabilities unlike the LEGACY version. So, even seasoned GRUB LEGACY users should take a look at what GRUB2 can do to take advantage of the powerful shell like scripting along with new features.

Upgrading to GRUB 2 might be necessary as it allows:
* booting from UEFI;
* booting from GPT partitioned drives without even needing an akward hybrid MBR, even though one can one for compatibility/portability reasons;
* booting from directly logical volume management such as LVM2 support;
* booting from raid DM-RAID support 4, 6 and 10;
* and booting from encrypted devices, LUKS I assume because the inexistent documentation is not clear on this: so no guidance on a howto for the moment.

== Installation ==

GRUB2 is both hard masked and in development, so one has to both keywords and unmask the package as the following before merging the package.
{{RootCmd
|echo '<nowiki>=</nowiki>sys-boot/grub-1.99* **' >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
|echo 'sys-boot/grub:2' >> /etc/portage/package.unmask
|emerge -av sys-boot/grub:2}}
{{Note|Note the equal sign and the version number range unmasked because many new user ask all the time, and rightly with that, about not wanting to merge the live version and that, happen when sys-boot/grub:2 is unmasked like the following line. Unmask the version number range that fit you best of course.}}
{{RootCmd|echo '<nowiki>>=</nowiki>sys-boot/grub-1.99 **' >> /etc/portage/package.keywords}}
Else, one would have to undergo a manual configure, make and make install on his/her own which won't be covered by this modest contribution.

== Configuration ==

=== Partitioning and preparing boot disk ===
Before installing GRUB2 to the boot media a little care should be taken when preparing and partitioning the boot device be it an internal disk or be it a removable device. This depend on the boot type involved: BIOS or UEFI.
BIOS booting can be easily achieved with either booting from disk partitioned with the aging MBR or with GPT with a protective MBR or a hybrid MBR if dual booting is involved with GPT unaware OS like MSDOS/Windows. It's another story for UEFI as GPT is part of UEFI specification and it's mandatory to use GPT partitioned in this case. 

If dual booting is involved with Windows which cannot boot from anything else but BIOS/MBR or else on GPT partitioned disk only on EFI hardware. In the later case dual booting Windows is simple and the former is trickier a GPT partitioned disk and a hybrid MBR. More on this subject will come later.

Before going further, one could back the boot device MBR with something like:
{{RootCmd|dd if<nowiki>=</nowiki>/dev/sda of<nowiki>=</nowiki>/root/sda.mbr bs<nowiki>=</nowiki>512 count<nowiki>=</nowiki>1}}
or simply its boot loader with something like (here one can go as far as 446 bytes):
{{RootCmd|dd if<nowiki>=</nowiki>/dev/sda of<nowiki>=</nowiki>/root/sda.mbr bs<nowiki>=</nowiki>440 count<nowiki>=</nowiki>1}}

=== UEFI installation ===

Before setting up UEFI boot, one has to partition the boot device with a GPT compatible disk tools like GPT fdisk or gdisk, parted or gparted (a gtk gui) or other tools that I did not bother to try at this point. It's advised to have something greater than 200MB and maybe smaller than 500MB for multi boot systems. GPT disk is a powerfull tools than can be used to setup a few advanced settings like hybrid MBR or the number of alignment sectors. The default 2048 sectors (1MiB) is a sane default which will permit to make use of sector 34-2048 to embed GRUB2 core.img for example if one forgot to leave some space for BIOS boot partition.

Here, one has to make a [0x]ef00 partition type. Here is an example of such a GPT partitioned disk with BIOS boot [0xef02] partition and an EFI [0xef00] partition. Here the output of the `p' command in gdisk main menu.

Creating partions in gdisk is pretty straight and quick forward for somebody who use fdisk. Just type `n' in the main menu provide a beginning and end if need be and then type the partition type ef00 for EFI for example. That's all.

Let's move to installing GRUB2 and setting up an EFI boot entry. I do not have an EFI board so EFI specifc boot steps is not tested!

First, create a filesystem and a mount point for the EFI partition with something like:
{{RootCmd|mkdosfs -F 32 -n efi-boot /dev/sda1
|mkdir /boot/efi
|echo 'LABEL<nowiki>=</nowiki>efi-boot /boot/efi vfat defaults 0 2' >> /etc/fstab
|mount /boot/efi
|mkdir -p /boot/efi/<nowiki>{</nowiki>EFI/BOOT,GRUB2<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}

{{Note|Note that I use /boot/efi as a mount assuming there's a classic `/boot' mount for BIOS boot, otherwise one can make use of `/boot' without the `/efi' sub-directory. The `-F 32' switch is for creating FAT32 and `-n efi-boot' the LABEL of the filesystem. Adapt it to your needs.}}

And then install GRUB2 (x86 users should replace x86_64 by i386)
{{RootCmd|grub_efi_x86_64-install --root-directory<nowiki>=</nowiki>/boot/efi --boot-directory<nowiki>=</nowiki>/boot/efi/EFI --bootloader-id<nowiki>=</nowiki>GRUB2 --no-floppy}}
or install everything manually if something goes wrong.
{{RootCmd|cp -a /lib/grub2/x86_64-efi/* /boot/efi/GRUB2/}}
{{Note|To override the default boot loader, according to UEFI 2 specification, one has to run the following command. This is handy when one cannot add an EFI boot entry as the utility will fails if `/sys/firmware/efi/vars/' is not empty.}}
{{RootCmd|cp /boot/efi/GRUB2/grub.efi /boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI}}
{{Note|According to UEFI 2 specifications, the default bootloader location is `[EFI System Partition]\EFI\BOOT\BOOTx64.EFI' for 64bit systems (and `[...\BOOTIA32.EFI]' for 32bit systems).}}

It might  be necessary to build a customized core.img with a few builtin modules to be safe or to satisfy specific requirements.

{{RootCmd|grub2-mkimage -p /grub2 -o /boot/efi/GRUB2/grub.efi -O x86_64-efi ext2 fat lvm part_msdos part_gpt search_fs_uuid}}

Before any attempt to add a menu entry to EFI boot menu, inserting EFI module and merge the utility is necessary.
{{RootCmd|modprobe efivars
|echo 'sys-boot/efibootmgr **' >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
|emerge -av sys-boot/efibootmgr}}
And then add an boot menu entry.
{{RootCmd|efibootmgr --create --gpt --disk /dev/sda --part 1 --write-signature --label "GRUB2" --loader "\\EFI\\GRUB2\\grub.efi"}}
