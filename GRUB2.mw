{{Warning|GRUB2 GRUB2 is in development but still quite stable if I may say aside from some weird issues as the infamous `invalid signature' and thus rightly masked in portage.}}
== Introduction ==
GRUB2 is next generation, a complete rewrite, of GRUB LEGACY popular GNU/Linux boot loader. The new version has a new shell like syntax which permit advanced scripting capabilities unlike the LEGACY version. So, even seasoned GRUB LEGACY users should take a look at what GRUB2 can do to take advantage of the powerful shell like scripting along with new features.

Upgrading to GRUB 2 might be necessary as it allows:
* booting from UEFI;
* booting from GPT partitioned drives without even needing an akward hybrid MBR, even though one can one for compatibility/portability reasons;
* booting from directly logical volume management such as LVM2 support;
* booting from raid DM-RAID support 4, 6 and 10;
* and booting from encrypted devices, LUKS I assume because the inexistent documentation is not clear on this: so no guidance on a howto for the moment.
