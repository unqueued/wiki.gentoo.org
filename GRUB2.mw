{{Warning|GRUB2 GRUB2 is in development but still quite stable if I may say aside from some weird issues as the infamous `invalid signature' and thus rightly masked in portage.}}
== Introduction ==
GRUB2 is next generation, a complete rewrite, of GRUB LEGACY popular GNU/Linux boot loader. The new version has a new shell like syntax which permit advanced scripting capabilities unlike the LEGACY version. So, even seasoned GRUB LEGACY users should take a look at what GRUB2 can do to take advantage of the powerful shell like scripting along with new features.

Upgrading to GRUB 2 might be necessary as it allows:
* booting from UEFI;
* booting from GPT partitioned drives without even needing an akward hybrid MBR, even though one can one for compatibility/portability reasons;
* booting from directly logical volume management such as LVM2 support;
* booting from raid DM-RAID support 4, 6 and 10;
* and booting from encrypted devices, LUKS I assume because the inexistent documentation is not clear on this: so no guidance on a howto for the moment.

== Installation ==

GRUB2 is both hard masked and in development, so one has to both keywords and unmask the package as the following before merging the package.
{{RootCmd
|echo '<nowiki>=</nowiki>sys-boot/grub-1.99* **' >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
|echo 'sys-boot/grub:2' >> /etc/portage/package.unmask
|emerge -av sys-boot/grub:2}}
{{Note|Note the equal sign and the version number range unmasked because many new user ask all the time, and rightly with that, about not wanting to merge the live version and that, happen when sys-boot/grub:2 is unmasked like the following line. Unmask the version number range that fit you best of course.}}
{{RootCmd|echo '<nowiki>>=</nowiki>sys-boot/grub-1.99 **' >> /etc/portage/package.keywords}}
Else, one would have to undergo a manual configure, make and make install on his/her own which won't be covered by this modest contribution.
