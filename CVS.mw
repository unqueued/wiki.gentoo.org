'''CVS''' ('''C'''oncurrent '''V'''ersions '''S'''ystem) is an important component of Source Configuration Management (SCM). Using CVS enables users to record the history of sources files and documents. It fills a similar role to the free software RCS, PRCS, and Aegis packages.

== Installation ==
=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=dev-vcs/cvs}}

=== Emerge ===
Installing cvs is as easy as running an <tt>emerge</tt> command:
{{Emerge|dev-vcs/cvs}}

{{Note|If planning on using CVS for ''serving'' source code to clients be sure to <tt>emerge</tt> it with the <code>server</code> USE enabled!}}

=== Configuration ===

The default configuration file for CVS should be located in a file called {{Path|~/.cvsrc}} the user's home directory. Currently installing {{Package|dev-vcs/cvs}} through Portage does not create a default configuration file, therefore any specific configuration must be done by the user.

== Usage ==
Checkout a CVS module by using the following command:
{{Cmd|cvs checkout <module_name>}}
