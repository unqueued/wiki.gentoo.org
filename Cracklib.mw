=== CrackLib ===

Add the <code>cracklib</code> '''USE''' flag to {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} and re-emerge world to update any package that include support for CrackLib:
{{Emerge|params=--changed-use|@world}}

Verify these two packages are installed:
{{Emerge|params=--changed-use|{{Package|sys-libs/cracklib}} {{Package|cracklib-words}}}}

Now create a database:
{{RootCmd|create-cracklib-dict /usr/share/dict/*}}

=== SAMBA passwords policy ===

==== Using pdbedit ====

[https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/passdb.html#pdbeditthing pdbedit] is a tool that can be used only by root. It is used to manage the passdb backend, as well as domain-wide account policy settings. pdbedit can be used to:
* Add, remove, or modify user accounts.
* List user accounts.
* Migrate user accounts.
* Migrate group accounts.
* Manage account policies.
* Manage domain access policy settings.
Commands will be executed to establish controls for our domain as follows:
# Min password length = 8 characters.
# Password history = last 4 passwords.
# Maximum password age = 90 days.
# Minimum password age = 7 days.
# Bad lockout attempt = 8 bad log on attempts.
# Lockout duration = forever, account must be manually re-enabled.

The following command execution will achieve these settings:
{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "min password length" -C 8|output=<pre>
account policy value for min password length was 5
account policy value for min password length is now 8
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "password history" -C 4|output=<pre>
account policy value for password history was 0
account policy value for password history is now 4
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "maximum password age" -C 7776000|output=<pre>
account policy value for maximum password age was 4294967295
account policy value for maximum password age is now 7776000
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "minimum password age" -C 604800|output=<pre>
account policy value for minimum password age was 0
account policy value for minimum password age is now 7
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "bad lockout attempt" -C 8|output=<pre>
account policy value for bad lockout attempt was 0
account policy value for bad lockout attempt is now 8
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "lockout duration" -C -1|output=<pre>
account policy value for lockout duration was 30
account policy value for lockout duration is now 4294967295
</pre>}}

==== CrackCheck ====

Next [https://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2009-December/152634.html crackcheck] can be used to check complicity of passwords:

Unpack samba-*.tar.gz and <kbd>cd</kbd> to {{Path|examples/auth/crackcheck}}. Then compile it:

{{Cmd|make}}
Copy this to somewhere more sensible:
{{Cmd|cp crackcheck /usr/local/sbin}}
Edit Samba's configuration file:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/samba/smb.conf|title=Samba's configuration|1=<pre>
check password script = /usr/local/sbin/crackcheck -s -d /usr/lib/cracklib-dict
</pre>}}
Reload samba configuration:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/samba reload}}
