==Passwords policy==

===cracklib===

First of all add USE=cracklib end rebuild world:
{{Emerge|params=-uDN|@world}}

Install some tools:
{{Emerge|params=-n|cracklib cracklib-words}}

Now we can create DB:
{{RootCmd|create-cracklib-dict /usr/share/dict/*}}

===Unix password policy===

===SAMBA passwords policy===

====Use pdbedit====

[https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/passdb.html#pdbeditthing pdbedit] is a tool that can be used only by root. It is used to manage the passdb backend, as well as domain-wide account policy settings. pdbedit can be used to:
* add, remove, or modify user accounts.
* list user accounts.
* migrate user accounts.
* migrate group accounts.
* manage account policies.
* manage domain access policy settings.
Commands will be executed to establish controls for our domain as follows:
# min password length = 8 characters.
# password history = last 4 passwords.
# maximum password age = 90 days.
# minimum password age = 7 days.
# bad lockout attempt = 8 bad logon attempts.
# lockout duration = forever, account must be manually reenabled.
The following command execution will achieve these settings:
{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "min password length" -C 8|output=<pre>
account policy value for min password length was 5
account policy value for min password length is now 8
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "password history" -C 4|output=<pre>
account policy value for password history was 0
account policy value for password history is now 4
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "maximum password age" -C 7776000|output=<pre>
account policy value for maximum password age was 4294967295
account policy value for maximum password age is now 7776000
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "minimum password age" -C 604800|output=<pre>
account policy value for minimum password age was 0
account policy value for minimum password age is now 7
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "bad lockout attempt" -C 8|output=<pre>
account policy value for bad lockout attempt was 0
account policy value for bad lockout attempt is now 8
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|pdbedit -P "lockout duration" -C -1|output=<pre>
account policy value for lockout duration was 30
account policy value for lockout duration is now 4294967295
</pre>}}

====crackcheck====

Next we may use [https://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2009-December/152634.html crackcheck] to check complicity of passwords:

Unpack samba-*.tar.gz and ''cd'' to {{Path|examples/auth/crackcheck}}.  Then compile it:
{{Cmd|make}}
Copy this to somewhere more sensible:
{{Cmd|cp crackcheck /usr/local/sbin}}
Edit your samba configuration:
{{File|/etc/samba/smb.conf||<pre>
check password script = /usr/local/sbin/crackcheck -s -d /usr/lib/cracklib-dict
</pre>}}
Reload samba configuration:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/samba reload}}
