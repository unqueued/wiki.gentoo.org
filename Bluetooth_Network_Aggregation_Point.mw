This article will deal with getting Gentoo to act as a Bluetooth Network Aggregation Point (NAP).

__TOC__

== What is a NAP ==

The Bluetooth specification incorporates the ability to create a Personal Area Network (PAN). It is an Ethernet transparent protocol, thus all standard protocols (especially IP) can be used in such a PAN. A NAP can be thought of being the Master in such a network. It will provide the connectivity to other networks (Internet for instance), for up to eight via Bluetooth connected PAN devices (cell phones, PDAs, laptops maybe).

== Scope of this article ==

We will deal with the creation of a Gentoo NAP, in order to connect a Bluetooth enabled cell phone with the Internet. Then for instance, one could synchronize the cell phone's contacts/calendar with a SyncML capable groupware server, located anywhere on the Internet (or the local network). We will henceforth call the NAP server "Gentoo-Box" and the PAN client "cell phone".

== Prerequisites ==

A [[Bluetooth|Bluetooth installation]] must be done first. If you use ''simple-agent'' or ''bluetoothctl'', no GUI programs or applets are needed. Set the "test-programs" USE flag on the ''net-wireless/bluez-4'' package, to get the latest ''bluez-test-nap'' script. Newer ''net-wireless/bluez-5'' doesn't have this USE flag yet, but the script named ''test-nap'' can be copied from the sources later. We also need [[Network bridge|Network Bridging]], but with our own host configuration.

== Setting up a network bridge ==

As the BlueZ NAP server relies on Gentoo to handle the Ethernet link created by BlueZ, we will create an Ethernet bridge, so we will be able to use the full power of the Gentoo startup scripts. Make sure to '''backup all files before editing''' them.

We will deal with the following scenario, as this is probably the easiest and most common case:

                             Global IP address  ┌─────>╎ Internet ╎
                                                │      +−−−−−−−−−−+
                                                │
                                                v
                          ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                          │                   Router                   │
                          │ (with DHCP and routing (NAT) capabilities) │
                          └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                         ^              ^
                                         │              │
┌────────────┐       ┌────────────┐      │              │      +−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−+
│ Cell phone │<─────>│ Gentoo-Box │<─────┘              └─────>╎ Local network ╎
└────────────┘       └────────────┘                            +−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−+
                                         Local IP address
</pre>

Execute ''ifconfig'' to locate the network card which connects to the router:

{{RootCmd|ifconfig|output=<pre>
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.0.2  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
        inet6 fe80::213:8fff:fea2:8e76  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 00:13:8f:a2:8e:76  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 101  bytes 12439 (12.1 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 82  bytes 9666 (9.4 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
...
</pre>}}

The line "inet 192.168.0.2  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255" is the one you should be looking for.

Remember the device name (''eth0'') and edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/net|lang=bash|1=
...
# Comment out this line, and add the following lines:
#config_eth0="dhcp"
config_eth0="null"
bridge_br1="eth0"
config_br1="dhcp"
bridge_forward_delay_br1=100
bridge_stp_state_br1=1
...
}}

This tells Gentoo to not ask for a DHCP lease on ''eth0'' (actually it tells Gentoo to do nothing for ''eth0''), and create a new bridge ''br1'', which contains ''eth0''. As ''eth0'' used to get its IP address via DHCP, we set ''br1'' to do exactly that. The options "bridge_stp_state_br1=1" and "bridge_forward_delay_br1=100" make sure, the Spanning Tree Protocol is used, and the forwarding state of the bridge will be reached within one second of a topology change. The last options speed up the cell phone connection considerably, as Gentoo tends to default to around 10 seconds, thus every cell phone connect would take at least that long.

Create a new symbolic link, and restart the network:

{{RootCmd
|ln -s net.lo /etc/init.d/net.br1
|rc-service net.eth0 stop && rc-service net.br1 start|output=<pre>
...
 * Bringing up interface br1
 *   Creating bridge br1 ...
 *   Adding ports to br1
 *     eth0 ...                                                                                         [ ok ]
 *   192.168.0.2 ...                                                                                    [ ok ]
</pre>}}

Check, if you are connected to the web. If everything works well, add ''br1'' to the "default" runlevel:

{{RootCmd
|ping -c1 wiki.gentoo.org
|rc-update add net.br1 default
}}

== Connecting a cell phone to the Internet ==

=== BlueZ 4 method ===

Start the NAP service and notice interface ''br1''. Enter in a terminal:

{{RootCmd|bluez-test-nap br1}}

Watch Syslog when you tell your cell phone to connect to the Internet using the Gentoo-Box as NAP:

{{RootCmd|tail -F /var/log/messages|output=<pre>
Mar 20 14:59:35 gentoo bluetoothd[1427]: Added new connection: bnep0
Mar 20 14:59:35 gentoo bluetoothd[1427]: bridge br1: interface bnep0 added
Mar 20 14:59:35 gentoo kernel: device bnep0 entered promiscuous mode
Mar 20 14:59:35 gentoo kernel: br1: port 3(bnep0) entered listening state
Mar 20 14:59:37 gentoo kernel: br1: port 3(bnep0) entered learning state
Mar 20 14:59:39 gentoo kernel: br1: topology change detected, propagating
Mar 20 14:59:39 gentoo kernel: br1: port 3(bnep0) entered forwarding state
</pre>}}

You should now be able to connect and load webpages.

==== Modifying the bluez-test-nap script ====

If you want to get rid of the sleep timer in the standard ''bluez-test-nap'' script, or you want to run the NAP service in the background, you could make these small changes:

{{FileBox|filename=signal-pause.patch|lang=diff|1=
--- /usr/bin/bluez-test-nap	2015-03-18 19:55:43.592015279 +0100

 print("Press CTRL-C to disconnect")
 
 try:
-	time.sleep(1000)
-	print("Terminating connection")
+	# CTRL-C = KeyboardInterrupt = SIGINT
+	# SIGINT is ignored in a non-interactive shell
+	# Use SIGUSR1 with a startup script
+
+	signal.signal(signal.SIGUSR1, signal.default_int_handler)
+	signal.pause()
 except:
 	pass
}}

Copy the script to an alternate location, and apply the patch:

{{RootCmd
|cp /usr/bin/bluez-test-nap /usr/local/bin/bluez-test-nap
|patch -p0 </PATH/TO/signal-pause.patch
}}

Now the NAP service can be started in five ways:

<!-- HTML list syntax to fix broken highlighting -->
<ul>
<li>

If {{Path|/usr/local/bin}} comes first in your $PATH, you can still type:

{{RootCmd|bluez-test-nap br1}}

{{RootCmd|which bluez-test-nap|output=<pre>
/usr/local/bin/bluez-test-nap
</pre>}}

</li>
<li>

To run the script in the background, and stop it:

{{RootCmd
|/usr/local/bin/bluez-test-nap br1 >/dev/null &
|killall -SIGINT bluez-test-nap
}}

</li>
<li>

To run at startup, let [[Local.d|{{Path|/etc/init.d/local}}]] read next scripts. These files must be made executable:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/bluez-test-nap.start|lang=bash|1=
hciconfig hci0 up {{!}}{{!}} exit 1
exec /usr/local/bin/bluez-test-nap br1 >/dev/null 2>&1 &
}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/bluez-test-nap.stop|lang=bash|1=
killall -SIGUSR1 bluez-test-nap
}}

{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/local.d/bluez-test-nap.start /etc/local.d/bluez-test-nap.stop}}

</li>
<li>

Instead of the local.d files approach, it's better to use a real [[Handbook:X86/Working/Initscripts|init script]]. This file must be made executable:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/init.d/nap|lang=bash|1=
#!/sbin/openrc-run
# Copyright 1999-2015 Gentoo Foundation
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2
# $Header: $

depend() {
	use net.br1
	need bluetooth
}

start() {
	ebegin "Starting Bluetooth NAP"
	hciconfig hci0 up {{!}}{{!}} return 1

	start-stop-daemon \
		--start \
		--make-pidfile \
		--pidfile /var/run/nap.pid \
		--background \
		--exec /usr/local/bin/bluez-test-nap br1
	eend $?
}

stop() {
	ebegin "Stopping Bluetooth NAP"
	start-stop-daemon --stop --retry -INT/4/-TERM/1/-KILL/1 \
		--pidfile /var/run/nap.pid
	eend $?
}
}}

{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/init.d/nap}}

</li>
<li>

In case of plugging and unplugging an USB dongle, just an [[Udev#Rules|udev rule]] can do the job:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/90-bluetooth.rules|lang=bash|1=
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="hci0", \
  RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'hciconfig hci0 up {{!}}{{!}} exit 1; exec /usr/local/bin/bluez-test-nap br1 >/dev/null 2>&1 &'"
ACTION=="remove", KERNEL=="hci0", \
  RUN+="/usr/bin/killall -SIGUSR1 bluez-test-nap"
# In case of trouble (ugly):
#ACTION=="remove", KERNEL=="hci0", \
#  RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'killall -USR1 bluez-test-nap; killall -KILL bluetoothd; rc-service bluetooth restart'"
}}

</li>
</ul>

=== BlueZ 5 method ===

The [[#BlueZ_4_method|BlueZ 4 way]] will work, but ''bluez-test-nap'' must be renamed to ''test-nap''. Copy the new script ''test-nap'' and it's dependency ''bluezutils.py'', from the ''test'' directory in the source package to {{Path|/usr/local/bin}}. The script ''test-nap'' must be made executable.

Also the default behaviour of BlueZ 5 changed. Before using ''test-nap'', the device must be initialized. Desktop applications like ''BlueDevil'' do that automatically. Otherwise, this command can be used:

{{RootCmd|hciconfig hci0 up}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== No webpages can be loaded ===

If the phone does not show any sign of being connected, try [[Wireshark]] to figure out what packets are being sent and received. Maybe a simple

{{RootCmd|echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward}}

can do the trick. Make sure no firewall settings on the Gentoo-Box interfere.

=== Restore your old Internet connection ===

If you lose your Internet connectivity, if things break, restore your backup of {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}} and restart networking:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/net|1=
(old file)
}}

{{RootCmd|rc-service net.eth0 restart}}

=== Tools for testing ===

There is a ''bluez-test-network'' utility, that you can use for testing PAN connection initiated from server side, and a ''monitor-bluetooth'' utility to watch what is going behind the [[D-Bus]] scene, because watching {{Path|/var/log/messages}} can be not enough.
