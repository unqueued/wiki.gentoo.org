{{DISPLAYTITLE:ACCEPT_KEYWORDS}}

{{Metadata|abstract=The ACCEPT_KEYWORDS variable informs the package manager which ebuilds' KEYWORDS values it is allowed to accept.}}

The <var>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</var> variable informs the package manager which ebuilds' <var>[[KEYWORDS]]</var> values it is allowed to accept.

== 어디에 변수를 설정하죠? ==

The variable is usually set through the Gentoo [[Profile (Portage)|profile]] but can be overruled in the users' {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]}} file, per-package in the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords]]}} file/directory or even on the command line.

{{Important|명령줄에서 <code>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</code> 변수값을 중복 지정하면 값을 오래 유지하지 않아 꾸러미 관리자의 원하지 않은 동작을 초래하므로 보통 좋지 않은 방법으로 간주합니다.}}

== 안정, 불안정 키워드 ==

The default value of most profiles' <var>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</var> variable is the architecture itself, like <code>amd64</code> or <code>arm</code>. In these cases, the package manager will only accept ebuilds whose <var>KEYWORDS</var> variable contains this architecture. If the user wants to be able to install and work with ebuilds that are not considered production-ready yet, they can add the same architecture but with the <code>~</code> prefix to it, like so:

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]|lang=bash|1=
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"
}}

One should not specify the stable keyword (<code>amd64</code>) when adding the testing keyword (<code>~amd64</code>) because <var>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</var> is an incremental variable.

If the setting is not to be made system-wide, then it can be set per-package in the {{Path|package.accept_keywords}} file or directory:

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords]]|1=
# games
games-fps/doomsday ~amd64
}}

In addition to the normal values from <var>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</var>, {{Path|package.accept_keywords}} supports three special tokens<ref>Gentoo Portage, [https://dev.gentoo.org/~zmedico/portage/doc/man/portage.5.html Manual page for Portage]. Retrieved on January 30th, 2015.</ref>:

* <code>*</code> — Package is visible if it is stable on any architecture.
* <code>~*</code> — Package is visible if it is in testing on any architecture.
* <code>**</code> — Package is always visible (<var>KEYWORDS</var> are ignored completely).

The last choice is useful for live package versions (which are svn/git/mercurial/… versions of packages, supported through what is called a live ebuild and which don't have a <var>KEYWORDS</var> variable).
