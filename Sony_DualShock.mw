This article describes the use of Sony DualShock 3 / [[Wikipedia:Sixaxis|Sixaxis]] and DualShock 4 [[Wikipedia:PlayStation|PlayStation]] controllers via USB and Bluetooth.

== Prerequisites ==

This article assumes that [[USB]] and [[Bluetooth]] have been previously configured.

== Hardware ==

* DualShock 3 / Sixaxis:

{{Cmd|lsusb|output=<pre>
054c:0268 Sony Corp. Batoh Device / PlayStation 3 Controller
</pre>}}

* DualShock 4:

{{Cmd|lsusb|output=<pre>
054c:05c4 Sony Corp.
</pre>}}

== Usage ==

=== USB ===

* Connect the DualShock to the system using a USB cable and press the {{Key|PlayStation}} button.

* Turn the DualShock off when it's no longer in use by pressing and holding the {{Key|PlayStation}} button for 10 seconds.

* Press the {{Key|PlayStation}} button to use the DualShock again.

=== Bluetooth ===

{{Note|It is recommended to use a Bluetooth controller that supports at least [[Wikipedia:Bluetooth#Bluetooth v2.1 + EDR|Bluetooth 2.1+EDR]].}}

The recommended minimum version of BlueZ to use is 5.14. This release adds full support for the DualShock 4.<ref>Johan Hedberg. [http://www.bluez.org/bluez-5-14/ Release of BlueZ 5.14], [http://www.bluez.org/ BlueZ], January 21st, 2014. Retrieved on October 24th, 2014.</ref> This release also incorporates DualShock 3 setup and pairing support which was added in BlueZ 5.12.<ref>Johan Hedberg. [http://www.bluez.org/release-of-bluez-5-12/ Release of BlueZ 5.12], [http://www.bluez.org/ BlueZ], December 10th, 2013. Retrieved on October 24th, 2014.</ref> It is possible to use the DualShock 3 with earlier versions of BlueZ (including BlueZ 4), but the [http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixlinux.en.html sixpair] utility would then be required to pair with the DualShock 3.

==== DualShock 3 ====

* Start bluetoothctl:

{{Cmd|bluetoothctl}}

* Enable the agent and set it as default:

{{Cmd
|agent on
|default-agent
|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue
}}

* Power on the Bluetooth controller, and set it as discoverable and pairable:

{{Cmd
|power on
|discoverable on
|pairable on
|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue
}}

* Connect the DualShock 3 to the system using a USB cable and press the {{Key|PlayStation}} button.

* Discover the DualShock 3 MAC address:

{{Cmd|devices|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue}}

* Disconnect the USB cable from the DualShock 3:

* Allow the service authorization request:

{{Cmd|Authorize service ''service_uuid'' (yes/no): yes|prompt=[agent]|color=red}}

* Trust the DualShock 3:

{{Cmd|trust ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue}}

* The DualShock 3 is now paired:

{{Cmd|quit|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue}}

* Turn the DualShock 3 off when it's no longer in use by pressing and holding the {{Key|PlayStation}} button for 10 seconds.

* Press the {{Key|PlayStation}} button to use the DualShock 3 again.

==== DualShock 4 ====

* Start {{c|bluetoothctl}}:

{{Cmd|bluetoothctl}}

* Enable the agent and set it as default:

{{Cmd
|agent on
|default-agent
|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue
}}

* Power on the Bluetooth controller, and set it as discoverable and pairable:

{{Cmd
|power on
|discoverable on
|pairable on
|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue
}}

* Scan for devices:

{{Cmd|scan on|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue}}

* Put the DualShock 4 into pairing mode by pressing and holding the {{Key|PlayStation}} and {{Key|Share}} buttons until the light bar starts flashing.

* Discover the DualShock 4 MAC address:

{{Cmd|devices|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue}}

{{Cmd|pair ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=blue}}

* Allow the service authorization request:

{{Cmd|Authorize service ''service_uuid'' (yes/no): yes|prompt=[agent]|color=red}}

=== Battery charge level ===

The DualShock battery charge level can checked via [[sysfs]]:

{{Cmd
|cat "/sys/class/power_supply/sony_controller_battery_04:76:6e:9a:98:fc/capacity"
|output=<pre>
25
</pre>}}

The battery charge level for the DualShock 3 will reported as either 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% remaining. These values correspond to 3, 2, 1, and 0 bars respectively when checked via the PlayStation 3. The battery charge level for the DualShock 4 will be reported in the range of 100% to 0% remaining, at intervals of 10%.

The battery charge level can also be checked with {{Package|sys-power/upower}}. First, list available devices:

{{Cmd
|upower -e
|output=<pre>
/org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_sony_controller_battery_04o76o6eo9ao98ofc
/org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/DisplayDevice
</pre>}}

Next, display the DualShock power information:

{{Cmd
|upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_sony_controller_battery_04o76o6eo9ao98ofc
|output=<pre>
