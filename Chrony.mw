{{Package|net-misc/chrony}} is a versatile implementation of the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). It can synchronize the [[system time|system clock]] with NTP servers, reference clocks (e.g. GPS receiver), and manual input using wristwatch and keyboard. It can also operate as an NTPv4 (RFC 5905) server and peer to provide a time service to other computers in the network.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-misc/chrony}}

=== Emerge ===

Install the chrony package:

{{Emerge|net-misc/chrony}}

== Configuration ==

{{Path|/etc/chrony/chrony.conf}} is the configuration file for {{c|chronyd}}. The default configuration is populated with:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/chrony/chrony.conf|1=
# Use public NTP servers from the pool.ntp.org project.
pool pool.ntp.org iburst

# Record the rate at which the system clock gains/losses time.
driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift

# In first three updates step the system clock instead of slew
# if the adjustment is larger than 1 second.
makestep 1.0 3

# Enable kernel synchronization of the real-time clock (RTC).
rtcsync

hwclockfile /etc/adjtime
}}

{{Note|Time zones and location of the server do not matter for the NTP protocol; it synchronizes via [[Wikipedia:Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]].}}

On systems where a network connection is not always available at boot (laptops, etc.), it might help to change the pool line in the server configuration:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/chrony/chrony.conf|1=
pool pool.ntp.org iburst auto_offline
}}

This tells chronyd that the machine will be assumed to have gone offline when 2 requests have been sent to it without receiving a response.
You will need to use the {{c|chronyc online}} command to re-enable polling (See below)

=== Acting as a local NTP server ===

By default, {{c|chronyd}} only synchronizes the local machine time. By adding allow and deny rules, it will act as a local NTP source:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/chrony/chrony.conf|1=
# Note order does not matter for this example, order does matter with 'allow all' or 'deny all'
# Allow a specific IP
allow 1.2.3.4
# Deny a certain subnet
deny 1.2.3
# Allow all of the 1.2.x.x subnet
allow 1.2
}}

== Usage ==

=== chronyc Client Interface Tool ===

{{c|chronyc}} is a command-line interface program which can be used to monitor chronyd's performance and to change various operating parameters whilst it is running. A full list of commands can be found in the manual, {{c|man 1 chronyc}}

Examples:

{{RootCmd
|chronyc offline # Set all sources offline
|chronyc online # Set all sources online
}}

=== chronyd service ===

Add {{c|chronyd}} to the default runlevel to have the time synchronized automatically.

{{RootCmd
|rc-service chronyd start
|rc-update add chronyd default}}

To monitor status of the server:

{{RootCmd|rc-service chronyd status}}
