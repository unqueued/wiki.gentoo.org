'''Installing Gentoo on the Asus Transformer Prime (TF201)'''

This is an introduction to installing gentoo on the Asus Transformer Prime (TF201).  At the moment, we can get it to boot and launch X, but there are quite a few problems.  Hopefully, this site will invite others to share their own experiences, and maybe even generate some solutions to these problems.

==== INSTRUCTIONS ====

The basic steps are as follows:

===== PRELIMINARIES =====

This guide assumes that you have installed the Jelly Bean update from ASUS.  THIS GUIDE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS: CHECK BACK OFTEN FOR UPDATES!  (CHECK THE HISTORY.) 

NOTA BENE: WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR TFP!

===== CREATE A CHROOT =====

The first thing you'll want to do is generate a gentoo "rootFS".  You can either do this by using a [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/embedded/handbook/ cross-compiler] on another computer or on the TFP within
a chroot environment.  This guide assumes that you are doing the latter.  It further assumes that you will be installing the rootFS on the microSD card (mmcblk1p1) which you have mounted on the TFP in the directory /sdcard/gentoo.

* Follow the standard Gentoo Installation Guide.
* You should use the [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/arm/autobuilds/current-stage3-armv7a_hardfp/ armv7a-hardfp] stage3.
* Download and extract [https://github.com/tux-mind/tf201-dev/blob/master/root_patch.tar.gz root_patch.tar.gz] inside your chroot.  This will install some configuration files and the kernel modules and the (binary) firmware.
* If you don't trust us, then run:
# emerge linux-firmware (or just mkdir /lib/firmware)
# mkdir /system && ln -s /lib /system/vendor && ln -s /lib/firmware /system/etc
# (outside chroot) cp -R /system/vendor/firmware/* /system/etc/*.txt /sdcard/gentoo/lib/firmware 
# (TODO: Not all of these files are necessary.  We should weed out the ones that aren't.  AFAIK, just the bcm4329 firmware is required.  See make menuconfig for more information.)
# Compile your own kernel (see below) to populate /lib/modules.
# Add to /etc/conf.d/modules:
  modules="bcm4329"
  module_bcm4329_args="iface_name=wlan0"
* NB: I found that mounting /dev/pts to /sdcard/gentoo/dev/pts before you chroot allows tmux to work.  
* NB: You can either add -userfetch to make.conf FEATURES (to fix an emerge error about the user being unable to fetch packages) or add the portage user to the 3003 group.  See [https://github.com/keesj/gomo/wiki/AndroidSecurityUserAndGroups AndroidSecurityUserAndGroups].  See also CONFIG_ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK=y.
* NB: You will also need to establish /etc/resolv.conf by hand, by adding "nameserver x.x.x.x" to it inside the chroot.  You can get the  in Android by running getprop.
* NB: You must install wpa_supplicant, dhcpcd, and sshd and add them to the default run-level.
* NB: It would be easiest to disable qt4 USE flag with respect to wpa_supplicant (for now).
* NB: If you get a "sandbox violation" error while emerging, you have to emerge the single package that cause you this as follows (ideally, these should be reported as bug reports to bugs.gentoo.org):
  FEATURES="-sandbox" emerge -1 packagename

===== INSTALLING THE KERNEL =====

There are at present two ways to install the kernel on the TFP: nvflash or fastboot.  Once you have installed the kernel on the TFP and reboot, your machine should boot into Android (not Linux).  In order to have it boot into Linux, you need to configure the bootchooser.  See the next section.  Instructions on how to regenerate a kernel, blob, and LNX file are given further below.

====== FASTBOOT METHOD ======

In order to do fastboot, do the following:
o WARNING: AS USUAL, FASTBOOT AND THE TFP ARE CRANKY AND SO WHAT FOLLOWS MIGHT "BRICK" YOUR DEVICE.  PLEASE RESEARCH THE FASTBOOT UTILITY BEFOREHAND.
* Download the blob file to your computer: [https://github.com/tux-mind/tf201-dev/blob/master/test/test.blob test.blob]
* Add 28 bytes to the front of the blob file:
  dd if=/dev/zero bs=28 count=1 of=newtest.blob && dd if=test.blob of=newtest.blob oflag=append conv=notrunc
* Put the TFP in 'fastboot' mode: connect it to the computer via a usb cable, install ClockworkModRecovery app on the TFP, reboot the TFP and hold down VOLUMEDOWN upon reboot until some text shows up about going into recovery.  Release VOLUMEDOWN and wait, then select the USB ICON (VOLUMEDOWN to move, VOLUMEUP to select).  This is all standard, and documented elsewhere.
* Flash the blob to your TFP: 
  fastboot -i 0x0b05 flash boot newtest.blob.
* NB: 'flashboot devices' will claim there is no device.  But it is there.

====== NVFLASH METHOD ======

In order to do the nvflash method, do the following:
* WARNING: AS USUAL, NVFLASH AND THE TFP ARE CRANKY.  IT MIGHT "BRICK" YOUR DEVICE.  PLEASE RESEARCH WHEELIE AND NVFLASH BEFOREHAND.
* WARNING (2): wheelie is a binary with no open source (yet), and as with any binary you should be worried.
* Download the LNX file: [https://github.com/tux-mind/tf201-dev/blob/master/test/test.LNX test.LNX]
* Put the TFP in nvflash APX mode (reboot + VOLUMEUMP; this will yield a blank screen, but check dmesg to see that it is in APX mode).
* Run wheelie:
  wheelie --blob mysecret.blob (mysecret.blob is the blob you created when you installed wheelie).
* Flash the LNX file to your TFP:
  nvflash -r --download 6 test.LNX
* Reboot the TFP:
  nvflash -r --go (this sometimes won't reboot the machine)

===== CONFIGURE BOOTCHOOSER =====

The blob and LNX files we provide in git include a modified initrd.  What we did is overwrite 'init' with [https://github.com/tux-mind/tf201-dev/tree/master/boot_chooser bootchooser].  Bootchooser will mount the 8th partition of your eMMC, read the first line of the root-level file '.blob', which will be parsed as "device:directory:init" where:
    'device' is the block device where you put your gentoo system, e.g. /dev/mmcblk0p8, /dev/mmcblk1p1, or /dev/sda1.
    'directory' is the directory inside the previous device where your gentoo lives, e.g. /gentoo or /.
    'init' is the init script location in your gentoo root, usually /sbin/init.
If anything goes wrong, bootchooser will boot into Android.

Hence, if you have gentoo on the microSD card, .boot will be:
  /dev/mmcblk1p1:/:/sbin/init
If it is on /data/gentoo, then:
  /dev/mmcblk0p8:/gentoo:/sbin/init
If on the usb stick:
  /dev/sda1:/:/sbin/init

Once you have created this file, reboot and it should boot into Linux.  However, unless you have configured your gentoo to automatically start Xorg, you will see nothing but the ASUS logo.  In order to verify that it worked, either ssh in or reboot back into Android and check /sdcard/gentoo/var/log/messages.  You can debug problems by checking boot_chooser.log which is generated in the root of the Android filesystem (i.e. /data/boot_chooser.log).

==== GENERATE A TEST.BLOB / MODIFY INITRD / COMPILE THE KERNEL ====

The are not steps, but pointers:
* Unpack the blob (test.blob in git) to generate a .LNX file: blobunpack test.blob
* Extract the zImage and initrd from the .LNX file: abootimg -x test.LNX
* Extract the initrd: mkdir tmp && cd tmp && gunzip < ../initrd.img | cpio -i --make-directories
* Regenerate the initrd (from tmp): find . | cpio --create --format='newc' > ../initrd.img && gzip ../initrd.img 
* NB: Don't forget to gcc -o boot_chooser2.c init and cp that over to initrd as your init file.
* Regenerate the zImage (kernel): You will want to apply the JB15.patch in our git kernel/ directory, fixing an obvious error.  The kernel we used was the one from ASUS: kernel_v10_4_2_15.zip.  The patch also applies our .config file.  
* Regenerate the .LNX file: abootimg --create test.LNX -r initrd.img -k zImage
* Reblob pack: Use blobpack and when done add 28 bytes to the front of the file (see the fastboot method section above)

==== KNOWN BUGS ====

* Problem: After I launch X and I kill X, the screen is blank.
  Solution: There is none.  Make sure you have sshd installed.

* Problem: X goes blank and won't go unblank.
  Solution: Disable X blanking.  xset -dpms or xset s off or xset s noblank (or all three)

* Problem: xrandr -o left/right/normal/inverted don't work
  Solution: Install the tegra_drv (xorg driver) from RC16.2 of their Linux For Tegra release (see below)

* Problem: With Tegra Drivers (RC16.2) installed, xinput set-int-prop 8 "Evdev Axes Swap" 8 1 and xinput set-int-prop 8 "Evdev Axis Inversion" 8 1 0 get registered in, e.g., xinput list-props but fail to have an actual effect on the input x/y coordinates.
  Solution: None yet.

* My messages is spammed up with asusdec_kp_key and asusdec_keypad_processing debugging statements in /var/log/messages.
  Solution: None yet.

* With Tegra Drivers (RC16.2) installed, I also get some further cpu spam messages.
  Solution: None yet.

* The touchpad (on the ASUS Keyboard Dock) doesn't work.
  Solution: None yet.

* Sound doesn't work.
  Solution: None yet.

* Compositing doesn't work due to unavailable graphics shared memory.
  Solution: (tmux_mind: Did wart's tegra_drv installation fix this?  wart doesn't use compositing.)

==== TIPS ====

Here are some tips:
* edit /etc/inittab and comment out the c* and s* entries.  nvidia doesn't give us console or serial.  boo!
* mount /var/tmp and /tmp as tmpfs
* make a 2G swapfile
* /dev/mmcblk0p1,2,8 are ext4; mnt these in /mnt as system, cache, data respectively.
* sudo -u yourusername startx in /etc/local.d/mystuff.start for a quick and dirty test
* cpufreq-set -c 0 -g performance|powersave (do this for 0-3) (For some reason, placing /etc/init/nv.conf contents in lcoal.d/start.start causes cpufreq-set to stop working,s o whatever those things do, they broke this.)

==== UNDER DEVELOPMENT (TEGRA XORG DRIVER) ====

The tegra xorg driver (from L4T RC16.2) works!  
* extract (using --backup!) config.tbz2 and nvidia_drivers.tgz to /
* (notice that two files libjpeg.so and libEGL.so.1 are overwritten (TODO: test the conflicts))
* remove /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf (unnecessary; and in the wrong place)
* ln -s /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/tegra_drv.abi13.so tegra_drv.so
* recompile your kernel with CONFIG_SYSVIPC (otherwise X won't boot and will tell you to do this! TODO: add to test.blob/test.LNX)
* place the contents /etc/init/nv.conf in an local.d/mystart.start (I'm not sure what these do, but they cause cpufreq-set to not work and give us wonderful new messages in messages)
* rm -rf /etc/init (the ttyS0.conf file has no effect).

==== FUTURE ====

Recently (DEC 2012/JAN 2013), Stephen Warren and Thierry Reding have been working on getting an open tegra implementation in the kernel and also an xorg driver associated with that.  Purportedly, this will be in the 3.8 kernel.  We'll be keeping an eye on this over the next few weeks!  If anyone has given it a go, drop me a line!

JAN 2013:

I'll be busy over the next few weeks, so here's a status quaestionis:

(1) The nvidia tegra drivers (Linux For Tegra RC16.2, documented on
the wiki) seem to work.  There will be conflicts with two files, and
it would be nice to package things in an ebuild.
(2) As a result, xrandr -o left/right/normal/inverted work!
(3) But xinput set-prop 8 "Evdev Axis Inversion" 1, 1 && xinput
set-prop "Evdev Axes Swap" 1 don't (i.e. I can't get the input to
switch its coordiantes when I rotate the screen).
  - NB: fiddling with xinput set-prop 8 "Coordinate Transformation
Matrix" does change the input coordinates ,but it is strange. I
fiddled with this for a while.

The problem with (3) must be with the Atmel-Maxtouch code.  I did some
digging around and comparison to other atmel_maxtouch.c files located
in:

o https://github.com/EnJens/kernel_tf201_stock
  - THis seems to have an older version, although Rayman doesn't
document where he patched it from.

o https://github.com/AndroidRoot/android_kernel_asus_tf201/tree/10.4.2.17-mr1
  - Rayman recommended this as the latest and greatest, and it has the
latest Asus kernel_V10_4_2_17.zip (We should probably upgrade at some
point!), but the files in question related to atmel_maxtouch are the
same as Asus 10.4.2.15 (our version).

o https://github.com/atmel-maxtouch/linux/tree/maxtouch-v3.0/drivers/input/touchscreen
  - This looks promising.

And that's where I am at.  Soooo if you ever get around to thinking
about this problem -- and solve it or have more hints --- let me know.
