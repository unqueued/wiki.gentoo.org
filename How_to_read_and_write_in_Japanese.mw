= Introduction =
This guide explains how to read and write in Japanese on a non-Japanese system.

= What is needed ?=
== Japanese fonts ==
If your are not using a Japanese system, you probably have no such fonts installed and if you try to enter Japanes characters from your keyboard, you will only see small rectangle boxes in place of the characters on the screen.
== Input method ==
To read and write in Japanese, the firt thing you need is a way to enter Japanese characters with your usual keyboard. This is done via a piece of software usually called an ''input method''. At the moment, for the Japanese language,  there are 2 such common methods : '''anthy''' and '''mozc'''.


With such a software component typing '''ta''' on your keyboard will input the kana '''た''' into your word processor. Some simple manipulation that is relevant to the way your input method works, will permit you to easily switch from the hiragana '''た''' to the katakana  '''タ'''.
In a similar way typing '''nihon''' will input '''にほん''' and an other simple manipulation will permit you to turn this to the kanji version of this word '''日本'''.


{{Note|It is not the purpose of this guide to  describe in details how the anthy or mozc input methods work. Please refer to the documentation of this software components.}}

== IME ==
On top of this you also need a way to switch from the input method you normally use for your own language to the one you need for the Japanese language. This functionality is provided by an other piece of software called an IME for '''I'''nput '''M'''ethod '''E'''ditor such as '''ibus''' or '''SCIM''' . 
Once installed, you will be able to switch from your own language's input method to the Japanese input method using a key combination or using your mouse to select a relevant icon in the icon tray.

= Installing the software components =
== Japanese fonts ==
As a minimum, install the ''media-fonts/kochi-substitute'' package.
{{emerge| --ask kochi-substitute}}

As extra, are also available:
* media-fonts/ja-ipafonts
* media-fonts/vlgothic
* media-fonts/mplus-outline-fonts
* media-fonts/monafont
* media-fonts/ipamonafont
* media-fonts/sazanami
== Input Method and Input Method Editor ==
=== Installing ===
You are advised to prefer ibus to scim. To install the previous, you need three packages.
* app-i18n/anthy
* app-i18n/ibus-anthy
* app-i18n/ibus

Normally installing ibus-anthy should pull in ibus and anthy (if not emerge them separately).
{{emerge|  ibus-anthy}}

=== Launching the ibus daemon at boot time ===
Add these lines to your {{Path| ~/.xprofile}}  file and reboot.

{{File|~/.xprofile||<pre>export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
ibus-daemon -drx
</pre>}}
 
=== Configuring ===
To configure the Input Method Editor, use the following command as a standard user

{{cmd|ibus-setup}} 
Alternatively, if you are a gnome user, type ibus in the search bar and launch ibus-preferences.

In the dialog box that appears, click on the ''input method'' tab and add the japanese-anthy method. Then return to the ''General'' tab and define a key combination as a keyboard short cut for switching the input method.
