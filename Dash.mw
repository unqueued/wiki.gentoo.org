{{lowercase title}}
'''dash''' is the Debian Almquist shell: a small, fast, and posix-compliant shell. It is well-suited for startup scripts, and used on Debian (and derivative distros) as {{path|/bin/sh}} replacement. As some sh scripts may have bashisms in them, it is not guaranteed to work out-of-the-box on Gentoo as {{path|/bin/sh}} replacement.
