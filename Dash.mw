'''dash''' is the Debian Almquist shell: [[Article description::a small, fast, and POSIX compliant [[shell]].]] It is well-suited for startup scripts, and used on Debian (and derivative distributions) as {{path|/bin/sh}} replacement. As some shell scripts may have bashisms in them, it is not guaranteed to work out-of-the-box on Gentoo as {{path|/bin/sh}} replacement.
