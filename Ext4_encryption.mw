= Quick HOWTO on /home partition encryption =

== Quick overview ==
Ext4 supports file based encryption, which is superior over classic whole drive encryption (in terms of performance and also - you don't need encrypt things like opensource published projects).

== Basics ==
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ext4#Using_file-based_encryption you can find them here.

== Hard part -> decrypt before login ==
Since ext4 uses kernel keyring, which is divided into '''session''' keyring (everytime you login into console / X / wayland) and '''user''' keyring (persist for user, but only as user keep logged in).

=== Systemd part ===
So you'll need to run systemd unit before login screens (imposible with systemd). So, I just cut tty6 for password prompt.

No need to use all 6 VT's.. So you need modify logind.conf and reduce number of reserved VTs. 
# cat /etc/systemd/logind.conf
<code>
...
[Login]
NAutoVTs=3
ReserveVT=1
...
</code>

Create systemd service 

# cat /etc/systemd/system/decrypt.service 
<code>
[Unit]
Description=Decrypt
Wants=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=REPLACEWITH_USERNAMEOFYOURUSER
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/decrypt.sh
KeyringMode=inherit
StandardInput=tty-force
TTYPath=/dev/tty6
TTYReset=yes
TTYVHangup=yes
TTYVTDisallocate=yes
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

</code>

and script - wait for displaymanager loads itself, then switch to VT 6, ask password and save it to @s (session), set permissions to allow link it to @u (user keyring) and change back to VT 7 (display manager). Sleep infinity, because at moment, when this script ends, user keyring is wiped and it has no point.

Into script you have to fill number, which you'll get after you run
<code>/usr/sbin/e4crypt add_key</code> under normal circumstances and then run <code>keyctl list @s</code>.

# cat /usr/local/sbin/decrypt.sh
<code>
#!/bin/bash
sleep 10
chvt 6
systemd-ask-password | /usr/sbin/e4crypt add_key -k @s
keyctl setperm `keyctl search @s logon ext4:_THIS_NUMBER_YOU_GET_FROM_keyctl list @u_` 0x3d3d0000
keyctl link `keyctl search @s logon ext4:_THIS_NUMBER_YOU_GET_FROM_keyctl list @u_` @u
sleep 1
chvt 7
sleep infinity
</code>

Last think, you need link from @u (user keyring) to @s (session keyring), because otherwise ext4 is not able to detect key (no idea why).

So in my case

/etc/gdm/Xsession 
<code>
... somewhere in beggining of file...
keyctl link @u @s
... rest of it ....
</code>
