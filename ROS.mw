This guide is intended to be complementary to the official [http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Gentoo ROS Jade Installation Guide]. 

== Prerequisites ==

ROS jade has an overlay that is currently being maintained by the ROS Organization found [https://github.com/ros/ros-overlay here.]

You will need to set up the ROS [[Overlay]]. This removes the need for layman.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/repos.conf/ros.conf|lang=ini|1=
[ros-overlay]
location = /var/repo/ros-overlay
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/ros/ros-overlay.git
masters = gentoo
}}

{{Note|1=The location directory must exist before sync. Create the path or adjust it to somewhere appropriate.}}

Then sync the overlay (future {{c|emerge --sync}} operations will do this automatically):

{{RootCmd|emaint sync -r ros-overlay}}

In system dependencies:

It is not recommended to use pip in Gentoo. A large effort was made to ensure that all dependencies for primarily supported OS's (e.g. Ubuntu) are also resolved for Gentoo. Core ROS packages can be installed from the overlay.

{{Emerge|dev-vcs/wstool dev-python/rosdep dev-python/rospkg dev-python/catkin_pkg dev-python/rosinstall_generator}}

== Installation ==

The instructions from the official guide can be followed from this point.
