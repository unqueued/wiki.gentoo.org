This guide is intended to be complementary to the official [http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Gentoo ROS Jade Installation Guide]. 

== Prerequisites ==

ROS jade has an overlay that is currently being maintained by the ROS Organization found [https://github.com/ros/ros-overlay here.]

You will need to set up [[Layman]] to utilize the [[Overlay]].

In system dependencies:

It is not recommended to use pip in Gentoo. A large effort was made to ensure that all dependencies for primarily supported OS's (e.g. Ubuntu) are also resolved for Gentoo. Core ROS packages can be installed from the overlay.

The instructions from the official guide can be followed from this point.
