This guide is intended to be complementary to the official [http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Gentoo ROS Groovy Install Guide].

==System Setup==

ROS Groovy uses some old libraries whose ebuild are no longer in the main portage tree. An [https://github.com/focs/Gentoo-ROS-Overlay overlay] has been created to use bring back this ebuils and to host some ROS specific packages. 

Different ways of adding a local overlay can be found in [[Layman]] and [[Overlay]].

In system dependencies:

{{Emerge|pyyaml git cmake subversion mercurial gentoolkit setuptools}}
{{Emerge|boost gtest log4cxx wxpython dev-libs/apr dev-python/paramiko dev-libs/poco dev-libs/tinyxml dev-python/PyQt4}}


The following old libraries need to be installed:
{{Emerge|{{=}}sci-libs/vtk-1.5.8 {{=}}dev-cpp/eigen-3.0.2 {{=}}x11-libs/fltk-1.1.10-r2}}


Collada-dom can be installed from portage as well:
{{Emerge|media-libs/collada_dom}}


It is not recommended to use pip in Gentoo. ROS packages can be installed from the overlay too:

{{Emerge|
dev-vcs/wstool 
|sci-electronics/rosdep
|sci-electronics/rospkg
|sci-electronics/catkin_pkg 
|sci-electronics/rosinstall_generator}}


It is not needed to add any other overlay or to unmask <code>app-portage/gentoolkit</code> and <code>dev-python/setuptool</code>.

==ROS Installation==
The instructions from the official guide can be followed from this point.

*Take into account that rosdep is not really working.
*It is recommended to use the <code>--install-space /opt/ros/groovy</code> option. If you do, source <code>/opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash</code> instead of <code>install_isolated</code>.
*Full installation has not been tested, only Desktop.
