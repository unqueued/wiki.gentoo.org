Open source software developers (upstream) are glad, if their nice software gets distributed by the different Linux distributions. 
So are the users and the package maintainers. 

This page presents how to help package maintainers to distribute software. 
Most aspects apply for all Linux distributions.

=== Description ===
* Provide a short (<= 79 characters), neutral description what the program does. Most distributions can copy and paste this line on demand. Good example: "svg2bmp converts scalable vector graphics to black and white bitmap files"
Bad example: "yat is a very sophisticated t00l which will blow your mind away it is the swiss army knife for experts."
* Provide a long (~100 - 500 characters), neutral description too. Most distributions can copy and paste this to their package metadata.
* list the names of the authors
* list the names of the package maintainers
* where should bugs be sent to?

=== Versions ===
* Use a well defined versioning system. See for example [http://semver.org/ semver.org]
Package maintainers need this version number in the package. 
* If possible, tag a release on the version control system with the version number. 
Version number can be used in gentoo for simple version bumps from foo-1.0.2 to foo-1.0.3. 
* Never change software after release without increasing the version number. If the checksum changes, it brakes the package.
* Provide a compressed file for every release

=== License ===
* Provide a LICENSE (or COPYING) file in the root directory
* Verify, that the license information about the project is the same in the file header, manual, website...
* Avoid to invent a new license
* In the case of GPL, please add the version. Do you provide the software as GPL-2 or later (we call it GPL-2+), or only as GPL-2?
* Do not modify an open source license with own text.

=== Folder structure ===
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README README], or README.* in the root folder describes what the program does and how to install it
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog CHANGELOG] describes what changed between the releases. For packagers it is important to find here if a bug was fixed, or dependencies changed.

=== File formats ===
* .tar.gz is perfect 
* .zip files are fine too, but require an additional dependency on gentoo.
