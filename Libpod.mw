'''Libpod''' provides [[Article description::a library for applications looking to use the [[Wikipedia:Kubernetes#Pods|Container Pod]] concept, popularized by [[Wikipedia:Kubernetes|Kubernetes]].]] Libpod also contains the Pod Manager tool - {{c|podman}}.

Unlike [[Docker]], libpod is a daemonless container engine for interacting with [[Wikipedia:Open Container Initiative|OCI Containers]]. Optionally, a rootless operation mode is provided (see <code>rootless</code> USE flag).

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

{{Important|Kernel version 3.10 or greater is recommended<ref>[https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/libcontainer/SPEC.md Container Specification - v1], github. Retrieved on August 11, 2019</ref>.}}

As of ''libpod 1.3.2'' and ''runc 1.0.0_rc8'', there is no built-in kernel config check included. However, the {{c|runc}} upstream provides a method of listing its required kernel configuration via [https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/script/check-config.sh check-config.sh] script.

==== Rootless mode ====

User namespaces have to be enabled in order to use the rootless mode:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable support for libpod|1=
    General setup  --->
    -*- Namespaces support  --->
        [*]  User namespace
}}

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/libpod}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|app-emulation/libpod}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

* {{Path|/etc/containers/registries.conf}} - Specifies which container registries should be searched for images.
* {{Path|/etc/containers/policy.json}} - Defines policies for image validation.

Defaults are provided as {{Path|/etc/containers/registries.conf.example}} and {{Path|/etc/containers/policy.json.example}}.

==== Rootless mode ====

Libpod requires the user running {{c|podman}} to have a range of UIDs listed in {{Path|/etc/subuid}} and {{Path|/etc/subgid}} files. These UIDs are used for mapping the container UIDs to the host UIDs via user namespaces<ref>[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html], man7.org. Retrieved on August 4, 2019</ref>.

It is possible to edit them manually, although the recommended way is using {{c|usermod}}:

{{RootCmd|usermod --add-subuids 1065536-1131071 --add-subgids 1065536-1131071 larry}}

== Usage ==

The {{c|podman}} tool aims to be a drop-in replacement for {{c|docker}} client provided by Docker. For example, {{c|docker run}} becomes {{c|podman run}} and {{c|docker build}} becomes {{c|podman build}}.

All Container Pod-related actions are accessible via {{c|podman pod}} command.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Not enough namespaces ===

When running a container an error appears: ''error creating libpod runtime: there might not be enough IDs available in the namespace''.

In this case, increase the number of user namespaces permanently via a kernel setting:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf|1=user.max_user_namespaces=15076}}
