{{Package|sys-apps/pkgcore}} is an alternative package manager for Gentoo, similar to [[Portage]]. It aims for high performance, good extensibility and a clean design. It also subsumes most of the functionality of {{Package|sys-apps/eix}} and {{Package|sys-apps/layman}}.

{{Warning|Pkgcore support for EAPI 5 is still experimental.}}

== Basic usage ==

=== Updating the system ===

For synchronizing the local copies of the Portage tree and any overlays the {{c|pmaint}} utility is used. Then {{c|pmerge}} is invoked to update all packages and clean superfluous packages.

{{RootCmd|pmaint sync
|pmerge --ask --upgrade --deep --newuse
|pmerge --ask --clean --with-built-deps
}}

=== Searching and installing a package ===

To search for a package use the pquery program:

{{Cmd|pquery -nv <query>}}

For example to find some audio software for encoding {{Path|ogg}} files one may use the following to find {{Package|media-sound/vorbis-tools}}.

{{Cmd|pquery -nv --description ogg 'media-sound/*'}}

{{Note|Note the quotes around the extended atom to protect from expansion by the shell.}}

Then install the new package with {{c|pmerge}}:

{{RootCmd|pmerge --ask --verbose <atoms>}}

In our example this would be the following:

{{RootCmd|pmerge --ask --verbose media-sound/vorbis-tools}}

== Configuration ==

If there is no specific pkgcore configuration (that is {{Path|/etc/pkgcore.conf}} or {{Path|~/.pkgcore.conf}}) it reads the Portage configuration and converts it transparently for use. For a detailed explanation of how the pkgcore specific configuration works see [[Pkgcore/Configuration]].
