{{Package|sys-apps/pkgcore}} is an alternative package manager for
Gentoo, similar to [[Portage]]. It aims for high performance, good
extensibility and a clean design. It also subsumes most of the
functionality of {{Package|sys-apps/eix}} and
{{Package|sys-apps/layman}}.

{{Warning|Pkgcore support for EAPI 5 is still experimental.}}

== Basic usage ==

=== Updating the system ===

For synchronizing the local copies of the gentoo tree and any overlays the pmaint utility is used. Then pmerge is invoked to update all packages and clean superfluous packages.

{{RootCmd|pmaint sync
|pmerge --ask --upgrade --deep --newuse
|pmerge --ask --clean --with-built-deps}}

=== Searching and installing a package ===

To search for a package use the pquery program.

{{Cmd|pquery -nv <query>}}

For example to find some audio software for encoding ogg files one may use the following to find {{Package|media-sound/vorbis-tools}}.

{{Cmd|pquery -nv --description ogg 'media-sound/*'}}
{{Note|Note the quotes around the extended atom to protect from expansion by the shell.}}

Then install the new package with pmerge.

{{RootCmd|pmerge --ask --verbose <atoms>}}

In our example this would be the following.

{{RootCmd|pmerge --ask --verbose media-sound/vorbis-tools}}

== Configuration ==

Pkgcore by default if there is no {{Path|/etc/pkgcore.conf}} reads the
portage configuration and converts it transparently for use. For a
detailed explanation of how the pkgcore specific configuration works
see [[Pkgcore/Configuration]].
