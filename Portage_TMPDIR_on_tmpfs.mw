During emerge, you can build packages in tmpfs. Instead of having large build files in hdd. This speeds up emerge times and reduces hdd/ssd wearing.

== fstab ==
You can mount Portage TMPDIR to tmpfs with following config:
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
tmpfs		/var/tmp/portage	tmpfs	uid=portage,gid=portage,mode=0775,size=2048M,noatime	0 0
</pre>}}

Then mount Portage TMPDIR:
{{RootCmd|mount /var/tmp/portage}}

== Considering tmpfs size ==
Tmpfs should be big enough. When it gets full, emerge fails at that point. Most packages dont need much space but there are few very large packages.
For example:
app-office/openoffice: 10G or so.
www-client/chromium: More than 2GB.

== Per package choise for TMPFS / HDD ==
You can configure emerge to build large packages outside of the tmpfs drive.

Create the file to tell portage where to place the temporary files directory.
{{File|/etc/portage/env/notmpfs.conf||<pre>
PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/var/tmp/notmpfs"
</pre>}}

Create the temporary files directory.
{{RootCmd|mkdir /var/tmp/notmpfs}}

Create the file in which you will list all the packages that need some special environment variable settings.
{{File|/etc/portage/package.env||<pre>
app-office/libreoffice notmpfs.conf
mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird notmpfs.conf
www-client/chromium notmpfs.conf
</pre>}}
