'''ConsoleKit''' is a framework for defining and tracking users, login sessions, and seats. 

== Description ==
ConsoleKit's function is to support multiuser setups. It also works for a single user, but offers no benefits compared to existing methods.

ConsoleKit is a [[D-Bus]] daemon and creates for each PAM session its own session. All applications in that session can make use of the permissions granted to this session. ConsoleKit determines if the session is local (created by a local user in contrast to users logged in over the network), and if the session is active (meaning it's the most recent session). Based on these distinctions, ConsoleKit assigns device file permissions (e.g. for audio, video and more) to the session. Other software like [[polkit]] also make use of these distinctions.

Fast user switching is a feature powered by ConsoleKit. When switching, device file permissions get changed to the new active user and applications in the old session get notified, so they can revoke grants based on ConsoleKit information.

ConsoleKit supports shutdown/reboot handling, so that only the local, active user can shutdown or reboot the system.

The planned multiseat feature is not fully implemented. At the moment all local sessions are in ''Seat1'', all other sessions are in ''Seat2''.

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===
ConsoleKit uses [[D-Bus]], so set it up first.

=== Kernel ===
Make sure you have '''CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL=y''' in your kernel configuration (and recompile/restart if you changed it):
{{KernelBox|<pre>
General setup  --->
    [*] Auditing support
    [*]   Enable system-call auditing support
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
Portage knows the global USE flag ''consolekit'' for enabling support for ConsoleKit in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|sys-auth/consolekit}} automatically (this is default for ''desktop'' [[profile]]s):
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="... consolekit ..."
}}

The USE flags of consolekit are:
{{USEflag|package=sys-auth/consolekit
|acl+yes
|debug
|doc
|pam+yes
|policykit+yes
|selinux
|test
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Configuration ==

=== Boot service ===
You can now start ConsoleKit:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/consolekit start}}
To start ConsoleKit at boot time, add it your default runlevel (although it often also get started by ConsoleKit depending services):
{{RootCmd|rc-update add consolekit default}}

=== ConsoleKit integration for startx ===
If you want to start the X-server manually with '''startx''' (instead of using a [[display manager]]), you have to create the ConsoleKit session yourself. Therefore create the following {{Path|.xinitrc}} for your user:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session YOUR_COMMAND
}}
''YOUR_COMMAND'' needs to be replaced by a [[:Category:Window manager|window manager]] or a single application.

== Usage ==
* '''ck-list-sessions''': Shows all sessions and their details. For a local, active users ''active'' and ''is-local'' should be ''TRUE''.

== Troubleshooting ==
* {{Bug|consolekit|search=package}}
* '''ck-history --log''': Shows the logged messages.
* The ''ConsoleKit'' init.d script {{Path|/etc/init.d/consolekit}} uses the ''<code>-q</code>'' parameter to supress debug messages. Remove this parameter and restart the service to get more messages. Use also the parameter ''<code>--debug</code>'' to get even more messages.
* Consolekit communicates over D-Bus, so also see the [[D-Bus#Troubleshooting|D-Bus "Troubleshooting" section]].
