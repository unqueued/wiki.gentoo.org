'''ConsoleKit''' is a framework for defining and tracking users, login sessions, and seats. 

== Description ==

ConsoleKit's function is to support multiuser setups. It also works for a single user, but offers no benefits compared to existing methods.

ConsoleKit is a [[D-Bus]] daemon and creates for each PAM session its own session. All applications in that session can make use of the permissions granted to this session. ConsoleKit determines if the session is local (created by a local user in contrast to users logged in over the network), and if the session is active (meaning it's the most recent session). Based on these distinctions, ConsoleKit assigns device file permissions (e.g. for audio, video and more) to the session. Other software like [[polkit]] also make use of these distinctions.

Fast user switching is a feature powered by ConsoleKit. When switching, device file permissions get changed to the new active user and applications in the old session get notified, so they can revoke grants based on ConsoleKit information.

ConsoleKit supports shutdown/reboot handling, so that only the local, active user can shutdown or reboot the system.

The planned multiseat feature is not fully implemented. At the moment all local sessions are in ''Seat1'', all other sessions are in ''Seat2''.

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===

ConsoleKit uses [[D-Bus]], so set it up first.

=== Kernel ===

{{KernelBox|title=Required options for ConsoleKit|<pre>
General setup  --->
    [*] Auditing support
    [*]   Enable system-call auditing support
</pre>}}

=== Software ===

Portage knows the global USE flag <code>consolekit</code> for enabling support for ConsoleKit in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|sys-auth/consolekit}} automatically (this is default for <tt>desktop</tt> [[profile]]s).
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="... consolekit ..."
}}

The USE flags of ConsoleKit are:
{{USEflag|package=sys-auth/consolekit
|acl+yes
|debug
|doc
|pam+yes
|policykit+yes
|selinux
|test
}}

After setting the <code>USE</code> variable, update the system for the changes to take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Configuration ==

=== Boot service ===

Start ConsoleKit:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/consolekit start}}
To start ConsoleKit at boot time, add it to the default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add consolekit default}}

=== startx integration ===

To have a ConsoleKit session created when using <tt>startx</tt> to start the X server (instead of a [[display manager]]), add the following to {{Path|~/.xinitrc}}.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session YOUR_COMMAND
}}
<tt>YOUR_COMMAND</tt> needs to be replaced by a [[:Category:Window manager|window manager]] or a single application.

== Usage ==

* <tt>ck-list-sessions</tt>: Displays the details of all current sessions. For a local user, <code>active</code> and <code>is-local</code> should be <code>TRUE</code>.

== Troubleshooting ==

* {{Bug|consolekit|search=package}}
* <tt>ck-history</tt>: Use the <code>--log</code> parameter to display the logged messages.
* The ConsoleKit init.d script {{Path|/etc/init.d/consolekit}} uses the <code>-q</code> parameter to suppress debug messages. Remove this parameter and restart the service to get more messages. Use also the parameter <code>--debug</code> to get even more messages.
* Since ConsoleKit communicates over D-Bus, [[D-Bus#Troubleshooting|D-Bus Troubleshooting]] may be of help.
