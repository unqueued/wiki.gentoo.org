=== Emerge ===

After setting desired USE flags for the initial installation, <tt>emerge</tt> VLC:

{{Emerge|media-video/vlc}}

== Configuration ==

VLC is an extremely powerful program capable of playing almost any media file. It can every "play" binary files, although it is really not worth trying since there is really no point to "playing" most binaries.

== Usage ==

=== Alternate interfaces ===

VLC provides multiple interfaces in addition to the default GUI interface. There is an ncurses-based interface, and a HTTP interface that can be used for streaming or as a remote control. The VLC wiki has [https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Alternative_Interfaces a section dedicated to explaining the alternative interfaces].

Users may become confused when using VLC via Portage because, by default, the [[ebuild]] does not include the USE flags needed in order to include the dependencies needed for the alternative interfaces. Reference the Interfaces USE flag section above to see the interface related flags.

Once the flags have been set recompile VLC by using the following command:

{{Emerge|media-video/vlc|params=--changed-use}}

==== HTTP ====

When connecting to the HTTP interface, make sure a password is set. 

Leave the user name field blank when entering credentials on the web page [https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/http_intf/#Access_control leave the user name blank].

==== Hotkeys ====

VLC supports a host of hotkeys<ref>https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Hotkeys/</ref> for more efficient operation. There is [https://wiki.videolan.org/QtHotkeys/ an article] on the VLC wiki detailing all available hotkeys for the Qt interface.
