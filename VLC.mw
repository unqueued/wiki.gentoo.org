VLC media player is a wildly popular, cross platform video player and streamer. VLC media player has been quickly achieving its goal<ref>https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/35</ref> of world domination since its initial release in February of 2001.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=media-video/vlc}}

According to VideoLAN some certain USE flags need to be set in order to not get a very bare bones version of VLC.<ref>[http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-gentoo.html VideoLAN - VLC media player for Gentoo Linux], [http://www.videolan.org/ VideoLAN - VLC: Official site - Free multimedia solutions for all OS!]. Retrieved on February 17th, 2016.</ref>  Many of them might be obsolete or be set by the selected [[profile]].  For the standard desktop profile one might add to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} like
{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/package.use]]|1=media-video/vlc gnutls live lua matroska rtsp theora upnp vcdx}}

=== Emerge ===

After setting desired USE flags for the initial installation, <tt>emerge</tt> VLC:

{{Emerge|media-video/vlc}}

== Configuration ==

VLC is an extremely powerful program capable of playing almost any media file. It can even "play" binary files, although it is really not worth trying since there is really no point in "playing" most binaries.

== Usage ==

=== Streaming Online Multimedia ===

VLC provides users with the option to stream multimedia objects (youtube, vimeo music and more) to enable this functionality simply enable the {{c|lua}} useflag, if you have [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoolkit app-portage/gentoolkit] installed, it is a highly recommended package to have, simply issue:

{{RootCmd|euse -E lua -p media-video/vlc}}

After proper configuration and installation to stream multimedia in VLC you will find the option under '''File --> Open Network Stream''' in it you will be able to input URLs to popular multimedia websites such as Youtube along with other websites as well.


=== Alternate interfaces ===

VLC provides multiple interfaces in addition to the default GUI interface. There is an ncurses-based interface, and a HTTP interface that can be used for streaming or as a remote control. The VLC wiki has [https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Alternative_Interfaces a section dedicated to explaining the alternative interfaces].

Users may become confused when using VLC via Portage because, by default, the [[ebuild]] does not include the USE flags needed in order to include the dependencies needed for the alternative interfaces. Search the [[#USE_flags|USE flag]] section above for interface related flags.

Once the flags have been set recompile VLC by using the following command:

{{Emerge|media-video/vlc|params=--changed-use}}

==== HTTP ====

When connecting to the HTTP interface, make sure a password is set. 

Leave the user name field blank when entering credentials on the web page [https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/http_intf/#Access_control leave the user name blank].

=== Hotkeys ===

VLC supports a host of hotkeys<ref>https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Hotkeys/</ref> for more efficient operation. There is [https://wiki.videolan.org/QtHotkeys/ an article] on the VLC wiki detailing all available hotkeys for the Qt interface.
