If you get the following error message
{{CodeBox|title=ERROR: Cannot start PyCharm Community Edition:|1=No JDK found. Please validate either PYCHARM_JDK, JDK_HOME or JAVA_HOME environment variable points to valid JDK installation.}}

That means you did not set the <code>JDK</code> environment variables properly.

If you are using <code>bash</code>:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.bashrc|1=
export PYCHARM_JDK=`java-config -O`
}}

If you are using <code>fish</code>:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/fish/conf.d/pycharm.fish|1=
set -x PYCHARM_JDK (java-config -O)
}}
