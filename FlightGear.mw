= About FlightGear =
The FlightGear flight simulator project is an open-source, multi-platform, cooperative flight simulator development project.

= Installing FlightGear =
{{RootCmd|emerge flightgear}}

= Starting FlightGear =
The simulation can be started using a Window Manager's menu, however it's likely more preferrable to start FlightGear via the command line as there is more control over the options.  (ie. Aircraft models likely cannot be chosen easily once the simulation has started.)
 
== Basic Commandline Usage ==
{{Cmd|fgfs}}

== Advanced Commandline Usage ==
Show help messages:
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --help --verbose | less</nowiki>}}

Show a listing of available aircraft:
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --show-aircraft</nowiki>}}

Basic commandline incanatation (which is used within the Win32 build), adding geometry (use your own screen resolution) and timeofday options.
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --fg-root=/usr/share/games/flightgear --fg-scenery=/usr/share/games/flightgear/Scenery --aircraft=c172p-canvas --control=joystick --disable-random-objects --prop:/sim/rendering/random-vegetation=false --disable-ai-models --disable-ai-traffic --disable-real-weather-fetch --enable-clouds3d --enable-fullscreen --prop:/sim/frame-rate-throttle-hz=60 --geometry=1680x1050 --bpp=32 --timeofday=noon</nowiki>}}

=== Addtional Aircraft ===
Users can download additional (unsupported) aircraft models.  Once downloaded, extract the tarballs and use the following option:
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --fg-aircraft="${HOME}/.fgfs/my-extracted-aircraft-2.12.0</nowiki>}}

=== Additional Scenery ===
Users can download additional scenery or utilize terrasync.

Take note, there is currently no "/usr/share/games/flightgear/Scenery" folder as noted by the previous incanatation.

Download the tarball scenery and extract into a local folder and use the following option:
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --fg-scenery="${HOME}/.fgfs/my-extracted-scenery-2.12.0/:/usr/share/games/flightgear/Scenery:${HOME}/.fgfs/my-terrasync"-2.12.0</nowiki>}}

==== Terrasync ====
To enable Terrasync, use the following while remembering to add the folder to the <nowiki>--fg-scenery</nowiki> list of folders, as already specified above.  (Unknown if specifying the additional Terrasync folder within fg-scenery is necessary.)
{{Cmd|mkdir ${HOME}/.fgfs/my-terrasync-2.12.0}}
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --enable-terrasync --terrasync-dir=${HOME}/.fgfs/my-terrasync-2.12.0 --fg-scenery=${HOME}/.fgfs/my-terrasync"-2.12.0</nowiki>}}

= Known Problems =
== Poor Frame Rates Compared to Win32 Build's Frame Rates ==
The default "c172p" aircraft model seems to cause significant frame rate loss.  Choosing another aircraft model such as the 
"c172p-canvas" alleviates this problem.

{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --aircraft=c172p-canvas</nowiki>}}
