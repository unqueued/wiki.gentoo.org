= About FlightGear =
The FlightGear flight simulator project is an open-source, multi-platform, cooperative flight simulator development project.

= Installing FlightGear =
{{RootCmd|emerge flightgear}}

= Starting FlightGear =
The simulation can be started using a Window Manager's menu, however it's likely more preferrable to start FlightGear via the command line as there is more control over the options.  (ie. Aircraft models likely cannot be chosen easily once the simulation has started.)

Basic commandline incanatation (which is used within the Win32 build), adding geometry (use your own screen resolution) and timeofday options.

= Known Problems =
== Poor Frame Rates Compared to Win32 Build's Frame Rates ==
The default "c172p" aircraft model seems to cause significant frame rate loss.  Choosing another aircraft model such as the 
"c172p-canvas" alleviates this problem.

{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --aircraft=c172p-canvas</nowiki>}}
