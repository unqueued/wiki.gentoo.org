= About FlightGear =
The FlightGear flight simulator project is an open-source, multi-platform, cooperative flight simulator development project.

= Installing FlightGear =
{{RootCmd|emerge flightgear}}

= Starting FlightGear =
The simulation can be started using a Window Manager's menu, however it's likely more preferrable to start FlightGear via the command line as there is more control over the options.  (ie. Aircraft models likely cannot be chosen easily once the simulation has started.)
 
== Basic Commandline Usage ==
{{Cmd|fgfs}}

== Advanced Commandline Usage ==
Show help messages:
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --help --verbose | less</nowiki>}}

Show a listing of available aircraft:
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --show-aircraft</nowiki>}}

Basic commandline incanatation (which is used within the Win32 build), adding geometry (use your own screen resolution) and timeofday options.
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --fg-root=/usr/share/games/flightgear --fg-scenery=/usr/share/games/flightgear/Scenery --aircraft=c172p-canvas --control=joystick --disable-random-objects --prop:/sim/rendering/random-vegetation=false --disable-ai-models --disable-ai-traffic --disable-real-weather-fetch --enable-clouds3d --enable-fullscreen --prop:/sim/frame-rate-throttle-hz=60 --geometry=1680x1050 --bpp=32 --timeofday=noon</nowiki>}}

=== Addtional Aircraft ===
Users can download additional (unsupported) aircraft models.  Once downloaded, extract the tarballs and use the following option:
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --fg-aircraft="${HOME}/.fgfs/my-extracted-aircraft-2.12.0</nowiki>}}

=== Additional Scenery ===
Users can download additional scenery or utilize terrasync.

Take note, there is currently no "/usr/share/games/flightgear/Scenery" folder as noted by the previous incanatation.

Download the tarball scenery and extract into a local folder and use the following option:
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --fg-scenery="${HOME}/.fgfs/my-extracted-scenery-2.12.0/:/usr/share/games/flightgear/Scenery:${HOME}/.fgfs/my-terrasync"-2.12.0</nowiki>}}

==== Terrasync ====
To enable Terrasync, use the following while remembering to add the folder to the <nowiki>--fg-scenery</nowiki> list of folders, as already specified above.  (Unknown if specifying the additional Terrasync folder within fg-scenery is necessary.)
{{Cmd|mkdir ${HOME}/.fgfs/my-terrasync-2.12.0}}
{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --enable-terrasync --terrasync-dir=${HOME}/.fgfs/my-terrasync-2.12.0 --fg-scenery=${HOME}/.fgfs/my-terrasync"-2.12.0</nowiki>}}

== Scripting Command Line Options ==
After awhile, it becomes more desirable to automate much of these commands per scenario.  It's nice to already have script files for different scenarios, named such as fgfs.sh, fgfs-mp.sh and fgfs-debug.sh to respectively start in single player, multiplayer or debug modes.

For example, to start a FlightGear multiplayer session more easily:
{{File|${HOME}/bin/fgfs-mp.sh||<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# Airports
# KPDX Portland Intl
# KLAX Los Angeles Intl
# PFAI Fairbanks Int
# KSFO San Fransisco, CA

# Aircraft
# 777-300
# c172p-canvas
# CitationX

/usr/games/bin/fgfs \
    --aircraft=c172p-canvas \
    --browser-app=/usr/bin/seamonkey \
    --callsign=BIGBIRD \
    --control=joystick \
    --disable-terrasync \
    --enable-game-mode \
    --enable-real-weather-fetch \
    --fg-root=/usr/share/games/flightgear \
    --multiplay=out,10,mpserver16.flightgear.org,5000 \
    --prop:/sim/rendering/multithreading-mode=AutomaticSelection \
    --prop:/sim/rendering/shaders/quality-level=0 \
    --prop:/sim/rendering/texture-compression=off \
    --log-level=alert \
    --units-feet
</pre>}}

Make the file executable and then easily run it whenever you want.  If you need to modify your options, you easily do so by editing the commented script file!
{{Cmd|<nowiki>chmod u+x ${HOME}/bin/fgfs-mp.sh</nowiki>}}
{{Cmd|./bin/fgfs-mp}}

(Omit the "./" if your "${HOME}/bin" is already within your $PATH.)

= Known Problems =
== Poor Frame Rates Compared to Win32 Build's Frame Rates ==
The default "c172p" aircraft model seems to cause significant frame rate loss.  Choosing another aircraft model such as the 
"c172p-canvas" alleviates this problem.

{{Cmd|<nowiki>fgfs --aircraft=c172p-canvas</nowiki>}}
