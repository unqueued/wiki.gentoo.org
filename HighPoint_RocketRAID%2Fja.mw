このガイドでは、Gentoo LinuxのROCKETRAIDカードのインストールを支援します。

== Installation ==

{{Warning|These instructions are only applicable to Linux kernels with a version less than 4.7.}}

=== Enabling the HPT-RR overlay ===

The [https://github.com/dsiggi/RocketRAID.git HPT-RR overlay] contains the necessary packages to easily install and configure a RocketRAID card.

The preferred method to enable the overlay is through [[layman]]. Edit {{Path|/etc/layman/layman.cfg}} and add the overlay definition:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/layman/layman.cfg|title=At the overlay to the config|lang=bash|1=<pre>
...
overlays  :
    https://api.gentoo.org/overlays/repositories.xml
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsiggi/RocketRAID/master/overlays.xml
...
</pre>}}

Next, synchronize the overlays and add the RocketRAID one (which is named ''RocketRAID''):

{{RootCmd
|layman -S
|layman -a RocketRAID
}}

It is of course also possible to clone the repository for a local overlay:

{{RootCmd|git clone https://github.com/dsiggi/RocketRAID.git }}

=== Building and installing the Linux kernel module ===

Depending on the [[#Supported_cards|hardware card]], enable the right USE flag.

Then, install the [https://github.com/dsiggi/RocketRAID/tree/master/sys-block/rocketraid sys-block/rocketraid] package in order to automatically build and install the right kernel module:

{{Emerge|rocketraid}}

=== Loading the kernel module ===

Load the newly built kernel module (example for the rr232x module):

{{RootCmd|modprobe rr232x}}

Validate that the hardware has been properly detected by reading through the {{c|dmesg}} output close after loading the module:

{{RootCmd|dmesg|output=<pre>
...
[    2.499913] rr232x: module license 'Proprietary' taints kernel.
[    2.500453] rr232x:RocketRAID 232x controller driver v1.10 (Dec 24 2014 11:50:36)
[    2.500684] rr232x:adapter at PCI 3:4:0, IRQ 16
[    3.073130] rr232x:start channel [0,0]
[    3.073149] rr232x:start channel [0,1]
[    3.073167] rr232x:start channel [0,3]
[    3.424978] rr232x:channel [0,0] started successfully
[    3.785922] rr232x:channel [0,1] started successfully
[    4.156860] rr232x:channel [0,3] started successfully
[    4.498815] scsi host6: rr232x
...
</pre>}}

If the module correctly found the hardware, then make sure that this module is automatically loaded at boot. This can be accomplished by adding it to the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/modules}} file.

=== Installing supporting software ===

There are a couple of software packages that provide additional support for the RocketRAID cards.

The [https://github.com/dsiggi/RocketRAID/tree/master/sys-block/hptraidconf sys-block/hptraidconf] package provides configuration and monitoring support for the RocketRAID card. It requires a daemon running on the system, provided through the [https://github.com/dsiggi/RocketRAID/tree/master/sys-block/hptsvr sys-block/hptsvr] package. The client itself does not need to be installed on the system that has the RAID card in it.

Deploy the two packages:

{{Emerge|hptsvr}}

{{Emerge|hptraidconf}}

== Configuration ==

To run the server, add the right hardware module to {{Path|/etc/hptcfg}}:

{{RootCmd|echo "rr232x" > /etc/hptcfg}}

Now start the server:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/hptsvr start}}

To start the server on every system boot, type in:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add hptsvr default}}

== Administration ==

To administer the RAID card settings, connect to the server using the {{c|hptraidconf}} command.

The default username is '''RAID''' and the default password is '''hpt'''.

{{RootCmd|hptraidconf [-i server:port]|output=<pre>
        HighPoint RAID Management Command Line Utility v3.3
Copyright (C) 2009 HighPoint Technologies, Inc. All rights reserved.
 
Login:RAID
Password:
</pre>}}

After a successful login, a prompt will appear through which the administrative tasks can be executed.
