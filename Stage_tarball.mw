A Stage tarball is an archive of the basic files used for the installation of Gentoo.  It is offered in architecture specific versions as stage 3 on [https://get.gentoo.org get.gentoo.org] and hosted on [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/ distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/<arch>/autobuilds/]

Downloading and expanding the stage tarball as described in [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Parts/Installation/Stage Gentoo handbook] will install an almost complete and almost functional system (the most important parts still missing are a kernel and a bootloader).

Stage 4 tarballs have become available for amd64 on [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds distfiles.gentoo.org] [https://blog.mthode.org/posts/2016/Jan/stage4-tarballs-minimal-and-cloud/ recently].
