A Stage tarball is an archive of the basic files used for the installation of Gentoo Linux. Stage tarballs can be generated with [[catalyst]] using the appropriate [[Catalyst#Specs|specs files]].

== Stage 1 ==

Stage 1 tarballs are generated from a {{Path|packages.build}} file. Each system profile may have a ''slightly'' different {{Path|base.packages}} file:

* {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/arch/amd64-fbsd/clang/packages.build}}
* {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/default/bsd/fbsd/packages.build}}
* {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/packages.build}}
* {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/uclibc/packages.build}}
* {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/hardened/linux/musl/packages.build}}
* {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/releases/freebsd-10.2/packages.build}}
* {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/releases/freebsd-10.3/packages.build}}
* {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/targets/systemd/packages.build}}
* {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/uclibc/packages.build}}

== Stage 2 ==

Stage 2 tarballs contain the same packages as a stage 1 tarball with one caveat: stage 2 tarballs are compiled from a stage 1 tarball. This is to ensure the stage 1 tarball contains the tool chain necessary to reproduce itself.

== Stage 3 ==

Stage 3 tarballs are compiled from stage 2 tarballs, but contain a [[System set (Portage)|system set]]. Portage includes a quick reference to this set of base packages by using the {{c|@system}} set operator.

Not including sub-profiles, the base file used for the system set of all profiles can be found at: {{Path|[https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/profiles/base/packages /usr/portage/profiles/base/packages]}}

Stage 3 tarballs offered in architecture specific versions are available [https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/ the downloads page]; they are hosted on [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/ distfiles.gentoo.org] (navigate to the {{Path|<arch>/autobuilds/}} directory).

Downloading and decompressing a stage 3 tarball as described in [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Stage|Gentoo handbook]] will install an almost-complete and almost-functional system (the most important parts still missing are a kernel and a bootloader).

== Stage 4 ==

Official stage 4 tarballs have [https://blog.mthode.org/posts/2016/Jan/stage4-tarballs-minimal-and-cloud/ recently] become available for the {{Keyword|amd64}} architecture on [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds distfiles.gentoo.org].

A cloud stage 4 has been created to aid in the process of virtual machine provisioning. These stage 4 files can be used with {{c|diskimage-builder}} (available via {{Package|app-emulation/diskimage-builder}}). See the [https://github.com/openstack/diskimage-builder/tree/master/diskimage_builder/elements/gentoo Gentoo README upstream] and [https://docs.openstack.org/developer/diskimage-builder/ official diskimage-builder documentation] for more information.
