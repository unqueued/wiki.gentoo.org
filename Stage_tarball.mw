A Stage tarball is an archive of the basic files used for the installation of Gentoo Linux.

== Stage 1 ==

Stage 1 tarballs are generated from a {{Package|base.packages}} file. Each system profile has a different {{Path|base.packages}} file.

== Stage 2 ==

Stage 2 tarballs contain the same packages as a stage 1 tarball with one caveat: stage 2 tarballs are compiled from the stage 1 tarball.

== Stage 3 ==

Stage 3 tarballs are compiled from stage 2 tarballs, but contain a system set.

Stages offered in architecture specific versions as stage 3 on [https://get.gentoo.org get.gentoo.org] and hosted on [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/ distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/<arch>/autobuilds/]

Downloading and decompressing a stage 3 tarball as described in [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Parts/Installation/Stage Gentoo handbook] will install an almost-complete and almost-functional system (the most important parts still missing are a kernel and a bootloader).

== Stage 4 ==

Some semi-official stage 4 tarballs have [https://blog.mthode.org/posts/2016/Jan/stage4-tarballs-minimal-and-cloud/ recently] become available for {{c|amd64}} on [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds distfiles.gentoo.org].
