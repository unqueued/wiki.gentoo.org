|Gentoo support for oVirt - VDSM|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
[http://www.ovirt.org/ oVirt] is a complete open sourced virtualization management platform working with KVM. VDSM is the agent that runs on each oVirt managed host. Patches should be submitted to upstream oVirt projects, mainly VDSM, to provide support to using Gentoo as operating system for oVirt managed hosts. This project includes the packaging of VDSM itself and required dependencies.
