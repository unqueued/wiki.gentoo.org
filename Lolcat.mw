== Installation ==
Install {{Package|games-misc/lolcat}}:
{{Emerge|lolcat}}

== Usage ==
There are many usecases, here are just a few ways to take advantage of it:
{{Cmd|find /usr/portage -type f -exec lolcat '{}' \;
|find /var/cache/man -type f -exec lolcat '{}' \;
|fortune {{!}} cowsay {{!}} lolcat
|tcpdump {{!}} lolcat
|emerge --info {{!}} lolcat

{{Note|All emerge commands can be lolcatted. Use wisely.}}

== Tweaking ==
It is funny to add this to your {{Path|~/.bashrc}}, if you wish to lolcat all the time:
{{File|~/.bashrc||<pre>
alias cat="lolcat"
</pre>}}
