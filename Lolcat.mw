== Why? ==
Lolcat is a funny terminal colorizer written in ruby and available [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/games-misc/lolcat in portage]. To emerge simply type:
 emerge games-misc/lolcat
Other recommended programs include ''games-misc/fortune-mod'' or ''games-misc/cowsay''.

== How? ==
There are many usecases, here are just a few ways to take advantage of it:
 find /usr/portage -type f -exec lolcat '{}' \;
 find /var/cache/man -type f -exec lolcat '{}' \;
 fortune | cowsay | lolcat
 tcpdump | lolcat
 emerge --info | lolcat
 cat /dev/urandom | base64 -w $COLUMNS | lolcat
{{Note|All emerge commands can be lolcatted. Use wisely.}}

== Tweaking ==
It is funny to add this to your ''~/.bashrc'' if you wish to lolcat all the time:
 alias cat="lolcat"
{{Warning|Adding this to <del>other peoples</del> your bashrc however might cause unexpected side effects, use with caution!}}
