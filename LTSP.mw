The '''Linux Terminal Server Project''' ([http://www.ltsp.org/ website]) is a collection of scripts and documentation to create a cluster of thin clients. For instance, an entire client chroot environment is built with a single command: ltsp-build-client. This article will guide you through the installation and configuration of a basic LTSP 5 system. 

This guide shows you how to install and configure the Gentoo LTSP 5 port. This guide assumes some knowledge of thin client architecture and experience in manually installing Gentoo. Also, you need a server and client with the specifications listed in the [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ltsp/index.php?title=Ltsp_LtspDocumentationUpstream LTSP manual]. Concerning the client networkcard, only PXE is included in this manual. 

{{Warning|LTSP and some other software used in this guide are not in the stable Portage tree.}}
{{Note|This tutorial uses '''x86''' as architecture for the client install}}
{{Note|You should be using 5.2.17}}

Several resources can help you speed you on your way in time of need. Others are listed in the Resources section. For more online LTSP help, you can visit #ltsp on one of the [http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml freenode irc servers].

=== Known Issues ===
* If you get an emerge error for "=dev-lang/python-2.6* is not installed", with a "die "$(python_get_implementational_package) is not installed";", this means that some of your binary packages were installed against Python 2.6, Remove your binary packages to let them compile against your new python environment.

* Several programs will fight for the virtual terminals on the clients. Comment out getty in inittab:
