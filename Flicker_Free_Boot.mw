Flicker Free Boot is a relatively new feature, that was created by Hans de Goede and is available in Fedora since version 30. This Wiki page will show you how to implement it in Gentoo, to have a smooth boot experience.<br>
<br>
This is not an easy task to accomplish and might break your system.<br>
'''Follow this tutorial at your own risk!'''<br>
== Testing ==
=== Dell PowerEdge T20 ===
This process was tested on a Dell PowerEdge T20 with Intel Xeon E3-1225v3 (Haswell Based) processor. On the Dell PowerEdge the boot proces is around 80% fluent. It flickers once for 2 - 3 sec. Unfortunately it's the same when booting from a Microsoft Windows 10 based USB key, so I guess it's the way it was implemented.
=== Lenovo ThinkPad P52 ===
This process was tested on a Lenovo ThinkPad P52 with Intel Core i7-8750H (Coffee Lake Based) processor. On the Lenovo ThinkPad P52 the boot proces is around completely fluent. It doesn't flicker, so this guide should work as expected.<br>
== Requirements ==

=== Hardware / Software ===
- A working UEFI setup, preferably with a Intel Skylake (6th Generation) or more recent processor.<br>
- Older (3rd to 5th Generation Core iXXXX series processors might work, but there's no guarantee<br>
- You must be using the Intel Onboard (i195) series graphics. Other graphics cards are not supported yet<br>
- The specified system must boot up in native UEFI mode. CSM mode needs to be disabled<br>

=== Knowledge ===
- A working gentoo setup, preferably configured with grub2<br>
- Intermediate to advanced knowledge about the Linux boot proces<br>
- Knowledge on how to manually patch and compile

== Summary ==
This tutorial assumes that you've currently got a working Gentoo setup. This setup boots in (U)EFI mode with CSM mode disabled.
