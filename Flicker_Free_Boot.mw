Flicker Free Boot is a relatively new feature, that was created by Hans de Goede and is available in Fedora since version 30. This Wiki page will show you how to implement it in Gentoo, to have a smooth boot experience.<br>
<br>
This is not an easy task to accomplish and might break your system.<br>

== Testing ==
=== Dell PowerEdge T20 ===
This process was tested on a Dell PowerEdge T20 with Intel Xeon E3-1225v3 (Haswell Based) processor. On the Dell PowerEdge the boot proces is around 80% fluent. It flickers once for 2 - 3 sec. Unfortunately it's the same when booting from a Microsoft Windows 10 based USB key, so I guess it's the way it was implemented.
=== Lenovo ThinkPad P52 ===
This process was tested on a Lenovo ThinkPad P52 with Intel Core i7-8750H (Coffee Lake Based) processor. On the Lenovo ThinkPad P52 the boot proces is around completely fluent. It doesn't flicker, so this guide should work as expected.<br>
== Requirements ==

=== Hardware / Software ===
- A working UEFI setup, preferably with a Intel Skylake (6th Generation) or more recent processor.<br>
- Older (3rd to 5th Generation Core iXXXX series processors might work, but there's no guarantee<br>
- You must be using the Intel Onboard (i195) series graphics. Other graphics cards are not supported yet<br>
- The specified system must boot up in native UEFI mode. CSM mode needs to be disabled<br>

=== Knowledge ===
- A working gentoo setup, preferably configured with grub2<br>
- Intermediate to advanced knowledge about the Linux boot proces<br>
- Knowledge on how to manually patch and compile

=== Summary ===
This tutorial assumes that you've currently got a working Gentoo setup. This setup boots in (U)EFI mode using grub2 with CSM mode disabled and is using an Intel processor with it's own integrated graphics card.

== Preparations ==
In order to be able to succesfully get everything working, there's a things you'll need to do in order to be able to succesfully getting this running on a system

=== Using the GIT version of plymouth and setting the correct USE flags ===
The only version that currently has these patches is the GIT version of plymouth. In order to emerge the GIT version of plymouth, you'll need to take the following steps<br>
# Run the command: {{RootCmd|nano -w /etc/portage/package.use/plymouth}}
# Add the following line to the file: {{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/plymouth|lang=portage|1=
sys-boot/plymouth libkms pango
}}
## Note that libkms is the minimal requirement for the splash screen even to show up and pango is required For interactivity (e.g.: If you want to have the ability to enter a LUKS password on a nice graphical screen). The gtk and gdm USE flags should be added respectively when using GDM as Display Manager or lightdm with GTK.
# Press CTRL + O, press [Enter] and press CTRL + X in order to save the file.
# Run the command: {{RootCmd|nano -w /etc/portage/package.use/plymouth}}
# Add the following line to the file: {{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/plymouth|lang=portage|1=
sys-boot/plymouth **
}}
# Now install the package: {{Package|sys-boot/plymouth}}, by running the command: {{RootCmd|emerge -av plymouth}}
## NOTE: This might pull in some extra dependencies. This is due to the fact that the ebuild will actually literally pull the package from GIT.
