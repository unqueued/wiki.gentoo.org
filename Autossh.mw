<big>Basic Instructions</big>

These are available at the autossh website and its README file:
* http://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/

<big>Important Tips</big>

The "-M" option '''is''' required, even if you don't want to use the monitoring option  (in which case, use "-M 0").

When using "-M"...
* Connections are tunnelled.  No firewall changes needed for autossh's monitoring feature.
* Ports need to be above 1024 if you are not logging in as root.
* If you use a password prompt, then autossh will wait for your password when it reconnects, and it won't be fully connected until you give that password. 


<big>Example</big>

This example uses SSH port 222 on the remote server, and sets up a SOCKS proxy on port 9999.  The "sleep" command is used instead of SSH's "-N" option so that a "Connected" message is provided upon successful login.

autossh -M 0 -p 222 -D 9999 -o "ServerAliveInterval 45" -o "ServerAliveCountMax 2" root@myserver 'echo && echo -e "Connected.\n" && sleep 9999999'
