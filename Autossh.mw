{{Lowercase title}}
Detects when SSH connections drop and auto-reconnects.

== Installation ==
{{Emerge|autossh}}

== Basic Instructions ==
These are available at the autossh website and its README file:
* http://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/
* http://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/README

== Important Tips ==
The "-M" option '''is''' required, even if you don't want to use the monitoring option  (in which case, use "-M 0").

When using "-M"...
* Connections are tunnelled.  No firewall changes needed for autossh's monitoring feature.
* Ports need to be above 1024 if you are not logging in as root.
* If you use a password prompt, then autossh will wait for your password when it reconnects, and it won't be fully connected until you give that password. So, it's helpful to use a key (instead of password) and ssh-agent.

== Examples ==
;1) Simple login example
{{Cmd|autossh -M 0 username@myserver}}

;2) More Complex Example
SSH on port 222. Setup a SOCKS proxy on port 9999.  Using "ServerAliveInterval" and "ServerAliveCountMax" as recommended in the autossh README file. 
{{Cmd|autossh -M 0 -p 222 -N -D 9999 -o "ServerAliveInterval 45" -o "ServerAliveCountMax 2" username@myserver}}

;3) Use autossh with sshfs
{{Cmd|sshfs -o reconnect,compression{{=}}yes,transform_symlinks,ServerAliveInterval{{=}}45,ServerAliveCountMax{{=}}2,ssh_command{{=}}'autossh -M 0' username@server:/ /mnt/remote"}}
