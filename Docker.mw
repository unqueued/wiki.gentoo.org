== About ==
Docker is a container virtualization environment. With it you can setup development environments without messing up your base system, or deploy instances of containers. This is a thin virtualization, using your host kernel, making it faster, but the container produces a kernel panic, you also will have a kernel panic.

== Kernel config ==
If you miss the kernel config, you will get a list of kernel options missing. You can set them manually, by using / (slash) in menuconfig to search the name of the option.
     -> General setup
     * -> Control Group support -->
     *    Device controller for cgroups
     *    Memory Resource Controller for Control Groups
     *      Memory Resource Controller Swap Extension
     *         Memory Resource Controller Swap Extension enabled by default

     *    Enable perf_event per-cpu per-container group (cgroup) monitoring
     *    -> Group CPU scheduler -->
     *         Group scheduling for SCHED_OTHER
     *           CPU bandwidth provisioning for FAIR_GROUP_SCHED
     *    Block IO controller

     -> Networking support
       -> Networking options -->
     * -> Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter) -->
     *    -> Advanced netfilter configuration
     *         Bridged IP/ARP packets filtering
     *    802.1d Ethernet Bridging

     -> Device Drivers
     *  -> Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) -->
     *      -> Device mapper support
     *         Thin provisioning target
     *  -> Network device support -->
     *    -> Network core driver support
     *       MAC-VLAN support
     *       Virtual ethernet pair device
       -> Character devices -->
     -*-  Enable TTY
     -*-    Unix98 PTY support
     *         Support multiple instances of devpts

Exit the kernel configuration, [[Kernel/Rebuild|rebuild the kernel, and reboot]].

== Installation ==

Use the app-emulation/docker package
{{RootCmd|emerge app-emulation/docker --ask --verbose}}


After successfully installed start it, and/or add to default boot sequence.

{{RootCmd|<pre>/etc/init.d/docker start
rc-update add docker default</pre>}}

Add yourself / relevant users to the docker group
{{RootCmd|usermod -aG docker youruser}}

== Testing docker ==
Create a new Dockerfile in an empty directory with the following content:
FROM php:5.6-apache

Run:
{{Cmd|<pre>docker build -t my-php-app .
docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app</pre>}}
