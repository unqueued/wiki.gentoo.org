Docker is a container virtualization environment which can establish development or runtime environments without modifying the environment of the base operating system. It has the ability to deploy instances of containers that provide a thin virtualization, using the host kernel, which makes it faster and lighter than full hardware visualization.

{{Warning|Containers that produce kernel panics will induce kernel panics into the host operating system.}}

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Kernel version 3.10 or greater is required in order to run Docker.

If the kernel has not been configured properly before merging the {{Package|app-emulation/docker}} package a list of missing kernel options will be printed by emerge. These kernel features must be enabled [[Kernel/Configuration|manually]]. Pressing the {{Key|/}} (forward slash) key while in the ncurses-based menuconfig to search the name of the configuration option.

For the most up-to-date values check the contents of the <var>`CONFIG_CHECK</var> in {{Path|/usr/portage/app-emulation/docker/docker-9999.ebuild}} file.

A graphical representation would look something like this:

After exiting the kernel configuration, [[Kernel/Rebuild|rebuild the kernel]]. If the kernel rebuild as also a kernel upgrade be sure to rebuild the bootloader's menu configuration, then reboot the system to the newly recompiled kernel binary.

Docker way of checking the kernel configuration:

{{RootCmd|exec /usr/share/docker/contrib/check-config.sh}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-emulation/docker}}:

{{Emerge|params+=--verbose|app-emulation/docker}}

==== PaX kernel ====

{{Note|When running a PaX kernel (like {{Package|sys-kernel/hardened-sources}}), memory protection on '''containerd''' needs to be disabled.}}

Tools in the {{Package|sys-apps/paxctl}} package are necessary for this operation. See [[Hardened/PaX Quickstart]] for an introduction.

{{RootCmd|/sbin/paxctl -m /usr/bin/containerd}}

For the '''hello-world''' example set this flag for '''containerd-shim''' and '''runc''':

{{RootCmd
|/sbin/paxctl -m /usr/bin/containerd-shim
|/sbin/paxctl -m /usr/bin/runc
}}

If an [https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/20303 issue with denied chmods in chroots] occurs, a more recent version of Docker (>=1.12) is needed. Use the {{Keyword|~amd64}} [[:/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|Keyword]] for Docker and its dependencies listed subsequently when running {{c|emerge app-emulation/docker}} again.

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

After Docker has been successfully installed, add it to the system's default runlevel then tell OpenrC to start the daemon:

{{RootCmd
|rc-update add docker default
|service docker start
}}

If you need to pass any additional options to the docker daemon edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/docker}} file.
See [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#/options upstream documentation] for the various options that can be passed to the <var>DOCKER_OPTS</var> variable.

==== systemd ====

To have Docker start on boot, enable it:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable docker.service}}

To start it now:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start docker.service}}

If you need to pass any additional options to the docker daemon create the {{Path|/etc/docker/daemon.json}} file. See the
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#/linux-configuration-file upstream documentation] for various options that be placed into this systemd specific configuration file.

=== Storage driver ===

By default on Gentoo Docker will use the device-mapper storage driver. View docker's settings in detail with the {{c|info}} subcommand:

{{RootCmd|docker info}}

==== btrfs ====

Verify [[btrfs]] filesystem support has been added to the host machines kernel:

{{Cmd|grep btrfs /proc/filesystems}}

Be aware the ''root'' of the docker engine ({{Path|/var/lib/docker/}} by default) must be adjusted to use the btrfs filesystem. If the btrfs storage pool is located under {{Path|/mnt}} or {{Path|/srv}}, then be sure to change the root (call the 'graph' in docker speak) of the engine.

OpenRV users will need to adjust the <var>DOCKER_OPTS</var> variable in the service configuration file located in {{Path|/etc/conf.d}}. The example below displays a change to the storage driver and the docker engine root:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/docker|lang=bash|1=
DOCKER_OPTS="--storage-driver btrfs --graph /srv/var/lib/docker"
}}

Start or restart the docker service in order to for the changes to take effect and then validate the changes:

{{RootCmd|docker info}}

=== Permissions ===

Add relevant users to the docker group:

{{RootCmd|usermod -aG docker <username>}}

{{Warning|Allowing a user to talk to the Docker daemon is equivalent to giving it full root access to the host. [https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface More]}}

== Usage ==

=== Testing ===

In order to test the installation, run the following command:

{{Cmd|docker run --rm hello-world|output=<pre>

Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker Hub account:
 https://hub.docker.com

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/userguide/

</pre>}}

That will first download from the [https://hub.docker.com/ Docker Hub] the image named ''hello-world'' (if it has not been downloaded locally yet), then it will run it inside new namespaces. It purpose is just to display some text through a container.

==== Building from a Dockerfile ====

Create a new Dockerfile in an empty directory with the following content:

{{FileBox|filename=Dockerfile|1=
FROM php:5.6-apache
}}

Run:

{{Cmd
|docker build -t my-php-app .
|docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app
}}

=== Own images ===

There are two different ideas how a container should be built.
* The minimal approach: According to the [https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#run-only-one-process-per-container container philosophy] a container should only contain what is needed to serve one process. In this case ideally the container consists of one static binary.
* The VM approach: A container can be treated like a full system virtualization environment. In this case the container includes a whole operating system.

==== Build environment for the image ====

The image can be created out of a live system or - preferably - out of a special build environment
* To create a build environment for the image, follow the [[Cross_build_environment]] guide. There is no need to emerge a full @system. The build essentials are enough.
** The toolchain tuple could look like <code>x86_64-docker-linux-gnu</code>
** The build essentials can be build like this {{RootCmd|x86_64-docker-linux-gnu-emerge -uva1 --keep-going $(egrep '^[a-z]+' /usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/packages.build) portage openrc util-linux netifrc}}

==== The minimal approach: Statically linked binaries ====

There are some caveats with this. The [[Cross_build_environment#Cross_building_static_binaries_for_closed_systems|hints for statically linked binaries]] should be kept in mind for this.

To build an nginx-image:
* Chroot into the build environment (e.g. <code>chroot-x86_64-docker</code>)
* Build the desired package statically linked {{RootCmd|<nowiki>NGINX_MODULES_HTTP="gzip" CFLAGS="$(emerge --info|grep ^CFLAGS|grep -oP '(?<=").*(?=")') -static" CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS LDFLAGS="$(emerge --info|grep LDFLAGS|grep -oP '(?<=").*(?=")') -static"  PKGDIR=/tmp/ emerge-chroot -va1 --buildpkgonly nginx:mainline</nowiki>}}
* Extract the binary package to a tmp dir (e.g. <code>mkdir /tmp/nginx && cd /tmp/nginx && tar xjvf /tmp/www-servers/nginx-*.tbz2</code>)
* Change the nginx configuration. At least add <code>daemon off;</code> and swap <code>listen 127.0.0.1</code> for <code>listen 0.0.0.0</code>.
* Add <code>etc/passwd</code>,<code>etc/resolv.conf</code>,<code>etc/nsswitch.conf</code> and a appropriate <code>etc/ssl</code>directory. Make sure the <code>etc/nsswitch.conf</code> has [[Cross_build_environment#customized_glibc|"files" instead of "compat"]] and the {{Path|etc/passwd}} file has an "nginx" user entry.
* Create the docker image out of the current directory {{Cmd|<nowiki>tar --numeric-owner -cj --to-stdout . |docker import - nginx-image</nowiki>}}
* Spawn a container and start nginx {{Cmd|docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name nginx-test -ti --rm nginx-image nginx}}

==== The VM-like approach ====

* Create the image out of the full environment {{Cmd|<nowiki>cd /usr/x86_64-docker-linux-gnu/ && tar --numeric-owner -cj --to-stdout . --exclude=./{proc,sys,tmp/portage} .|docker import - gentoo-image</nowiki>}}
* Spawn a new gentoo container and start a shell: {{Cmd|<nowiki>docker run -v /usr/portage:/usr/portage --name gentoo-test -ti gentoo-image /bin/bash</nowiki>}}
* This image can used as a base image. To build a nginx image for example run emerge nginx inside the container and push it back as new image afterwards: {{Cmd|<nowiki>docker commit --message "nginx-image" gentoo-test</nowiki>}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Docker service fails to start (systemd) ===

* Some users have issues on starting <code>docker.service</code> because of device-mapper error. It can be solved by loading a different storage-driver. E.g. Loading “overlay” graph driver instead of “device-mapper” graph driver.
* “overlay” graph driver requires "Overlay filesystem support" in kernel configuration:

{{KernelBox|title=Configuring the kernel for Docker|1=
File systems  --->
    <*> Overlay filesystem support 
}}

* Add following to <code>/etc/portage/package.use/iputils</code>, then re-emerge docker will solve this issue.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/iputils|lang=bash|1=
app-emulation/docker overlay -device-mapper
}}

* If you receive an error saying, <code>Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: list bridge addresses failed: no available network</code>, you may be missing the docker0 network bridge. Please see the following docker issue which provides a bash script solution to create the docker0 network bridge: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/31546

=== Docker service runs but fails to start container (systemd) ===

* if you are using systemd-232 or higher, and receive an error related to cgroups...
{{Cmd|docker run hello-world
container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused
"process_linux.go:359:lib/docker/overlay2/523ed887f681de6ea3838aa5b26c57e88547d65bdd883a6d3538729f19a3

* You will need to add the following line to your kernel boot parameters

{{CodeBox|title=Kernel Boot Parameter|1=systemd.legacy_systemd_cgroup_controller=yes}}
