==What is a Route==
A ''route'' is a rule, set in your kernel, to determine which physical network interface or which gateway to use, to reach a particular network (or single host). There are many types of routed protocols this article simply covers routing of the IP protocol. IP routes are stored in the kernel . 

To see the current routing table on  your host use:
{{Cmd|netstat -rn
|output=<pre>
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.50.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 lan
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     2000   0        0 wlan1
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    2000   0        0 wlan1
</pre>
}}
''netstat'' is a part of the default installed package {{Package|sys-apps/net-tools}}

show the routing table with {{Package|sys-apps/iproute2}}
{{RootCmd|ip route show
|output=<pre>
default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlan1 metric 1
192.168.50.0/24 dev lan proto kernel scope link src 192.168.50.1
127.0.0.0/8 via 127.0.0.1 dev lo 
192.168.1.0/24 dev wlan1 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.1
</pre>
}}

==Adding a Static Route==
To add a static route you have to know the IP and the subnet mask of a network you wish to route, and the gateway to that network.
In this example we route the network ''10.10.10.0'' with the netmask ''255.255.255.0'' to the gateway ''192.168.1.50''. 
{{Package|sys-apps/iproute2}} needs CIDR style netmasks, so it will be in this example''10.10.10.0/24''

Adding a static route with {{Package|sys-apps/iproute2}}
{{RootCmd|ip route add 10.10.10.0/24 via 192.168.1.50}}

Show the routing table:
{{RootCmd|ip route
|output=<pre>
default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlan1 metric 1
10.10.10.0/24 dev wlan1 via 192.168.1.50 src 10.10.10.1
192.168.50.0/24 dev lan proto kernel scope link src 192.168.50.1
127.0.0.0/8 via 127.0.0.1 dev lo 
192.168.1.0/24 dev wlan1 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.1
</pre>
}}

Or as a system user you show the routing table as this:
{{Cmd|netstat -rn
|output=<pre>
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
10.10.10.0      192.168.1.50    255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 wlan1
192.168.50.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 lan
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     2000   0        0 wlan1
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    2000   0        0 wlan1
</pre>
}}

On older systems you possibly will use the ''route'' command instead of the upper described to add a static route:

{{RootCmd|route add -net 10.10.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.50}}

The routing table is sorted from most specific routes to most general, and this is how it is read by the routing process. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_prefix_match Longest prefix match] - means the the smallest network, or the network with the largest netmask, or the most specific route f.e. ''255.255.255.255'' is at first position in a  routing table

==Adding a Permanent Static Route==
To add a permanent static route, open your favorite text editor to <tt>/etc/conf.d/net</tt> and adjust accordingly.
Make sure to refer to your current routing table for help.
{{File|/etc/conf.d/net||<pre>
...
routes_wlan1=(
   "10.10.10.0/24 via 192.168.1.50"
   "default via 192.168.1.1"
)
...
</pre>}}

Both statements above mean:
# IP packets destined to the '''10.10.10.0/24''' network are send to ''192.168.1.50''
# IP packets destined to all '''0.0.0.0/0''' other networks are send to ''192.168.1.1''

{{Note|0.0.0.0/0 means all other networks without a prefix (Subnet mask), the default route}}

The '''default route''' '''0.0.0.0/0''' is used if:
* the host has no physical or logical IP interface in the target network segment
* the host has to send IP packets outside of its own IP network segment, and there is no specific route found in the routing table for target IP network
