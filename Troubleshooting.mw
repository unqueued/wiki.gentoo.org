The purpose of this page is to provide users, in particular new ones, with a set of tools to allow them to troubleshoot and fix problems with their Gentoo setups on their own.  In addition, for those problems which are more complicated, this article seeks to provide users with the skills to collect information that will aid them and their supporters in resolving their issues with a greater degree of expediency.

This article assumes that you have read the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo Handbook] and understand the basics of using Gentoo.
