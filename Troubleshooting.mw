The purpose of this page is to provide users, in particular new ones, with a set of tools to allow them to troubleshoot and fix problems with their Gentoo setups on their own.  In addition, for those problems which are more complicated, this article seeks to provide users with the skills to collect information that will aid them and their supporters in resolving their issues with a greater degree of expediency.

This article assumes that you have read the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo Handbook] and understand the basics of using Gentoo.

==Where to Get Help==
* Wikis
:Gentoo has quite a few wikis all of which have a wealth of information. Be wary that some articles may contain old or outdated information, but hands down, reading wiki articles is always a critical step when using Gentoo.

=== Identifying the Problem ===
This part may seem like it's a no-brainer, but without it, any troubleshooting will be next to impossible.
Take note of a few things:
# Is this problem related to hardware or software?

=== Hardware Issues ===
==== Drivers ====
Drivers issues for hardware is one of the more common issues that we see in IRC.
First and foremost, we should identify what the hardware is that we are having issue with.  ''lspci'' and ''lsusb'' are great tools for this purpose.  For demonstration purposes, we'll be looking at my ethernet card as the troublesome device.
===== Determining the Proper Driver =====
We run {{RootCmd|lspci}} and we can see our card very clearly.
 03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8071 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 16)
and using {{RootCmd|lspci -n}} we see
 03:00.0 0200: 11ab:436b (rev 16)
Assuming that we weren't sure what driver we needed, the model name in the first, and vendor:model code of the second are all that we need to look up the device on a place like [http://wikidevi.com/ WikiDevi].
===== Verifying the Driver is Loaded =====
Getting the driver is less than half of the battle.  Most of the trouble with drivers is making sure that they are loaded and operating correctly.
Relying on our friend lspci again, we run {{RootCmd|lspci -k}}
 03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8071 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 16)
 	Subsystem: Acer Incorporated [ALI] Device 014e
 	Kernel driver in use: sky2
Note that here, we have text indicating that a driver is in use.  If not, we weren't able to successfully load the driver.  Assuming the driver was built as a module rather than builtin, try ''modprobe <module>'' to attempt loading the module.  If your driver was builtin, consider making it a module while you debug why it isn't working, because you can load a module with ''modprobe'' and unload a module with ''modprobe -r''.
===== Troubleshooting a Driver =====
To start, with your driver built as a module, {{RootCmd|modprobe -r}} it. run {{RootCmd|dmesg -c}}  This will clear your message buffer so that when troubleshooting the driver, we have very little extraneous information to deal with. Now, {{RootCmd|modprobe}} your driver, and run {{RootCmd|dmesg}}  This should aid us in finding out why our driver isn't functioning properly.  Often, we will be missing firmware, and should grab either sys-kernel/linux-firmware or a specific firmware package from Portage.
