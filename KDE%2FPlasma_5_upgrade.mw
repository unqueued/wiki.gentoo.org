Plasma 5 is the next generation of KDE's desktop environment, based on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5. Upgrading is fairly simple, although it cannot be coinstalled with Plasma 4 due to upstream design decisions.

Note that while Plasma 5 is in a good state, it is still under heavy upstream development and is missing some features present in KDE 4.

== Overlay ==
Plasma 5 packages are not yet in the main tree. Install [[layman]] and add the [[KDE/Overlay|KDE Overlay]]:
{{RootCmd|emerge -a layman|layman -f -a kde}}

== Profile ==
It is highly recommended to use the Plasma desktop profile as it sets a number of important options to ensure things run smoothly. It's not currently visible in eselect, so you must switch manually:
{{RootCmd|prompt=/etc/portage #|rm make.profile|ln -s /usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/plasma/ make.profile}}
