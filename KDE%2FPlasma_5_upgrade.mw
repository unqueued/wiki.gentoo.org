Plasma 5 is the next generation of KDE's desktop environment, based on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5. Upgrading is fairly simple, although it cannot be coinstalled with Plasma 4 due to upstream design decisions.

Note that while Plasma 5 is in a good state, it is still under heavy upstream development and is missing some features present in KDE 4.

== Overlay ==
Plasma 5 packages are not yet in the main tree. Install [[layman]] and add the [[KDE/Overlay|KDE Overlay]]:
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask app-portage/layman|layman --fetch --add kde}}

== Profile ==
It is highly recommended to use the Plasma desktop profile as it sets a number of important options to ensure things run smoothly. It's not currently visible in eselect, so you must switch manually:
{{RootCmd|cd /etc/portage|rm make.profile|ln -s /usr/portage/profiles/default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/plasma/ make.profile}}

Any packages affected by the profile change need to be rebuilt:
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --changed-use --deep world}}

== Unmasking and keywording ==
Plasma 5 is currently masked. For your convenience, unmasking files are provided in the overlay:
{{RootCmd|cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|ln -s /path/to/overlay/kde/Documentation/package.unmask/kde-plasma-5.2}}

It's also necessary to unmask the qt5 USE flag:
{{RootCmd|echo "-qt5" >> /etc/portage/profile/use.stable.mask}}

For stable users, you also need to keyword the required packages:
{{RootCmd|cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|
ln -s /path/to/overlay/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-frameworks-5.7.keywords | ln -s /path/to/overlay/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-plasma-5.2.keywords
}}

== Installation ==
The kde-plasma set provides the full Plasma 5 suite:
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask @kde-plasma}}

Alternatively, kde-plasma/plasma-desktop provides the basic desktop, leaving you free to install only the extra packages you require:
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask kde-plasma/plasma-desktop}}

== Troubleshooting ==
The most common issue with upgrading is running into blockers. Unfortunately, some packages just can't be coinstalled so they'll need to be removed.
