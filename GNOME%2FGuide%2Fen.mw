A frequently used environment is GNOME. This HOWTO tries to describe all aspects of GNOME, including installation, configuration, usage, and more!

== What is GNOME? ==

=== The Project ===

The [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] project is a free software project dedicated to the development of GNOME, a Unix/Linux desktop suite and development platform. The [http://foundation.gnome.org GNOME Foundation] coordinates the development and other aspects of the GNOME Project. 

=== The Software ===

GNOME is a desktop environment and a development platform. This piece of free software is the desktop of choice for several industry leaders. It is interesting both for business users, home users, and developers. 

=== The Community ===

Like with any big free software project, GNOME has an extensive user and development base. [http://planet.gnome.org GnomePlanet] is a popular blog aggregator for GNOME hackers and contributors whereas [http://developer.gnome.org Developer.Gnome.Org] is for the GNOME developers. [http://library.gnome.org/users/ GNOME Library] contains a huge list of GNOME resources for end users. The [http://worldofgnome.org/ World of GNOME] is also a popular aggregator for GNOME-related news.

== Installing GNOME ==

=== What do you need? ===

{{Important|First read and follow the instructions in the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration X Server Configuration Howto] to setup a X environment.}}

Before installing GNOME, editing the system's USE variables is a good idea. Make sure that <code>X</code> , <code>gtk</code> , and <code>gnome</code> are in the USE variable located in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. If support for <code>dbus</code> add it to the USE flags (dbus is a system message bus Gnome uses extensively). If no KDE support is required, remove <code>qt4</code> and <code>kde</code> from USE. USE variables can be removed by adding a minus sign (<code>-</code>) in front of them. See the example below for the minus sign used properly.

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Example flags for a GNOME environment|<pre>
USE="-qt4 -kde X dbus gtk gnome"
</pre>
}}

You can add the <code>branding</code> USE flag to get a lovely Gentoo-branded splashscreen instead of the default GNOME splashscreen:

{{RootCmd|echo "gnome-base/gnome-session branding" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{Note|When using the <code>desktop/gnome</code> profile, these USE flags will be set for you. It is possible to check the system profile by running <kbd>eselect profile list</kbd>. Modifications can be made by running <kbd>eselect profile set <profile-name></kbd> as root. Be sure to replace "<profile-name>" with the number or name of the desired profile.}}

Once done, begin the GNOME installation by emerging GNOME: 

{{RootCmd|emerge gnome-base/gnome}}

For a ''minimal'' GNOME installation, <tt>emerge gnome-light</tt>. This option provides a lightweight GNOME installation without the additional tools that a full GNOME installation provides so you might need to install additional packages afterwards.

{{RootCmd|emerge gnome-base/gnome-light}}
{{Note|The {{Package|gnome-base/gnome-light}} package does not pull in {{Package|gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver}}, which is needed for locking the screen. Be aware the screen probably will not lock without it.}}

This will take a while, so you might want to start reading all those books your mother bought you but you never opened. Done? Great, now update environment variables: 

{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

Next the remaining services and user groups will be cleaned. 

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus start
|rc-update add dbus default}}

Verify the ''plugdev'' group exists. If it does, it is advisable to make each GNOME user member of that group, but step this is optional (the group is not common anymore). 

{{RootCmd|getent group plugdev|output=<pre>
plugdev:x:104:
</pre>}}

Substitute <username> in the next command with each GNOME user's user name.

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> plugdev}}

=== First Impressions ===

It is time to take a look at what was just built. Exit the root shell and log in as a regular user. The next step is to configure the session manager to run GNOME when the the <tt>startx</tt> command is invoked (see [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration#Using_startx ssing startx] in the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration X Server Configuration Howto]) for more information.

{{Cmd|echo "exec gnome-session" > ~/.xinitrc}}

Starting with gnome-base/gnome-session-2.26.2, users will need to prepend the XDG_MENU_PREFIX variable to get the GNOME menus when using the {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} method to start the desktop. If {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} is not being used it will be handled automatically; no additional configuration is needed. 

{{Cmd|sed -i '1i\export XDG_MENU_PREFIX{{=}}gnome-' ~/.xinitrc}}

Now start the graphical environment by issuing <tt>startx</tt>: 

{{Cmd|startx}}

If all goes well GNOME should happily provide a greeting. Congratulations on setting up GNOME!

It is possible to configure GNOME further. Take a look at the articles listed in [[GNOME/Configuration#See_also]] for additional customization information.
