GNOME is a popular [[desktop environment]]. This guide tries to describe all aspects of GNOME, including installation, configuration, usage, and more!

== What is GNOME? ==

=== The project ===

The [https://www.gnome.org/ GNOME project] is a free software project dedicated to the development of GNOME, a Unix/Linux desktop suite and development platform. The [https://www.gnome.org/foundation/ GNOME Foundation] coordinates the development and other aspects of the GNOME Project. 

=== The software ===

GNOME is a desktop environment and a development platform. This piece of free software is the desktop of choice for several industry leaders. It is interesting both for business users, home users, and developers. 

=== The community ===

Like with any big free software project, GNOME has an extensive user and development base. [http://planet.gnome.org/ GNOME Planet] is a popular blog aggregator for GNOME hackers and contributors whereas [https://developer.gnome.org/ developer.gnome.org] is for the GNOME developers. [https://help.gnome.org/users/ GNOME Library] contains a huge list of GNOME resources for end users. The [https://plus.google.com/+WorldofGnomeOrg WOGUE] is also a popular aggregator for GNOME-related news.

== Prerequisites ==

Before the GNOME install process, first read and follow the instructions in the [[Xorg/Guide|Xorg guide]] to setup a X environment. X is the standard base for all desktop environments in Linux. Also, be sure to read and comply with all the settings from the [[systemd|systemd]] article.

{{Note|If the reader does not want to use GNOME with systemd, please read the [[GNOME/GNOME_Without_systemd|GNOME without systemd]] article.}}

== Installation == 

Before installing GNOME, editing the system's USE variables is a good idea. Make sure that <code>X</code>, <code>gtk</code>, and <code>gnome</code> are in the USE variable located in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. It is recommended to enable support for [[D-Bus]] system-wide. Systemd includes this system message bus. Add <code>systemd</code> to the USE variable as well (D-Bus is a system message bus that GNOME uses extensively). If no KDE support is required, remove <code>qt4</code>, <code>qt5</code> and <code>kde</code> from USE. USE flags can be removed by adding a minus sign (<code>-</code>) in front of them. See the example below for the minus sign used properly.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Example USE flags for a GNOME desktop environment|lang=bash|1=
USE="-qt4 -qt5 -kde X gtk gnome systemd"
}}

Adding the <code>branding</code> USE flag provides a lovely Gentoo-branded splash screen instead of the default GNOME splash screen:

{{RootCmd|echo "gnome-base/gnome-session branding" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{Note|When using the <code>desktop/gnome/systemd</code> profile, these USE flags will be set automatically. It is possible to check the system profile by running {{c|eselect profile list}}. Modifications can be made by running {{c|eselect profile set <profile-name>}} as root. Be sure to replace "<profile-name>" with the number or name of the desired profile.}}

Once finished, begin the GNOME installation by emerging GNOME: 

{{Emerge|gnome-base/gnome}}

For a ''minimal'' GNOME installation install the {{Package|gnome-base/gnome-light}} package. This option provides a lightweight GNOME installation without pulling in the full GNOME [[desktop environment]]. Most people may need to install additional packages afterwards.

{{Emerge|gnome-base/gnome-light}}

This will take a while, so start reading some books. Done? Great, now update environment variables: 

{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

Next the remaining services and user groups will be cleaned. 

Verify the <code>plugdev</code> group exists. If it does, it is advisable to make each GNOME user member of that group, but step this is optional (the group is not common anymore). 

{{RootCmd|getent group plugdev|output=<pre>
plugdev:x:104:
</pre>}}

Substitute <code><username></code> in the next command with each GNOME user's user name:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> plugdev}}

== First impressions ==

It is time to take a look at what was just built. Either configure the session manager to run GNOME when the the {{c|startx}} command is invoked (see [[Xorg/Guide#Using_startx|using startx]] in the Xorg guide for more information), or enable the [[GNOME/gdm|GDM service]], for a more convenient way to start Gnome.

=== Enabling GDM ===

==== Systemd ====

To start GDM upon boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable gdm.service}}

To start GDM immediately, run:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start gdm.service}}

{{Tip|The following command both enables and starts GDM immediately:
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable --now gdm.service}} }}

Another suggestion is to [[NetworkManager#systemd|activate Network Manager]], in case no other network managing service is activated.

=== Using startx ===

Exit the root shell and log in as a regular user. The next step is to configure the session manager to run GNOME when the the {{c|startx}} command is invoked (see [[Xorg/Guide#Using_startx|using startx]] in the Xorg guide for more information).

{{Cmd|echo "exec gnome-session" > ~/.xinitrc}}

Starting with gnome-base/gnome-session-2.26.2, users will need to prepend the <var>XDG_MENU_PREFIX</var> variable to get the GNOME menus when using the {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} method to start the desktop. If {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} is not being used it will be handled automatically; no additional configuration is needed. 

{{Cmd|sed -i '1i\export XDG_MENU_PREFIX{{=}}gnome-' ~/.xinitrc}}

Now start the graphical environment by issuing {{c|startx}}: 

{{Cmd|startx}}

If all goes well GNOME should happily provide a greeting. Congratulations on setting up GNOME!

== Customizing Gnome ==

For extra configuration options in GNOME 3 install the {{Package|gnome-extra/gnome-tweak-tool}} package. The tweak tool allows customization at a deeper level than the standard Settings frame.

=== Widgets in GNOME 3 ===

By default in Gentoo Gnome 3 does not support widgets. For users who wish to obtain widget functionality a separate package is available:

{{Emerge|gnome-extra/gnome-shell-extensions}}

After the Shell Extensions are installed, {{c|eselect}} can be used to control defaults on a global level:

{{RootCmd|eselect gnome-shell-extensions list|output=<pre>
Available extensions (* means enabled for all users by default):
  [1]   alternate-tab@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [2]   apps-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [3]   auto-move-windows@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [4]   drive-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [5]   launch-new-instance@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [6]   native-window-placement@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [7]   places-menu@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [8]   screenshot-window-sizer@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [9]   user-theme@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [10]  window-list@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [11]  windowsNavigator@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
  [12]  workspace-indicator@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
</pre>}}

=== Enable click-to-install Shell Extensions through the web browser ===

For web browsers such as [[Google Chrome]], [[Chromium]], and [[Vivaldi]] be sure to get the required browser add-on through the Chrome store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep

[[Firefox]] users can get it here: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/

[[Opera]] users will have to snag it here: https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/gnome-shell-integration/

After the add-on has been installed for the browser of choice, a backend must also be emerged:

{{Emerge|gnome-extra/chrome-gnome-shell}}

It should now be possible to install, manage, and uninstall shell extensions at https://extensions.gnome.org/

If things are not working as expected check the [https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation upstream installation instructions] for news.

== Removal ==

=== Unmerge ===

A possible way to completely remove a GNOME installation is by explicitly uninstalling the {{Package|gnome-base/gnome}} package, then cleaning the dependencies of that package.

In order to do this sanely make sure the main Portage repository has been synced:

{{RootCmd|emerge --sync}}

Next, run a world update so that the system is fully up-to-date:

{{Emerge|params+=--update --newuse --deep --with-bdeps=y|@world}}

Unmerge the GNOME base package:

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|gnome-base/gnome}}

Finally, depclean the system:

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --depclean}}

GNOME should now be removed.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Oh no something has gone wrong ===

One source of this error can be the permissions for the video device. When logging in fails and a message appears that says "Oh no, something has gone wrong", then try to become a member of the {{c|video}} group.  Add the user to the video group with {{c|gpasswd}} like so:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <user> video}}
