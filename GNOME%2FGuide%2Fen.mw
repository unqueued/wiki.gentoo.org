A frequently used environment is GNOME. This HOWTO tries to describe all aspects of GNOME, including installation, configuration, usage, ...

== What is GNOME? ==

=== The Project ===

The [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] project is a free software project dedicated to the development of GNOME, a Unix/Linux desktop suite and development platform. The [http://foundation.gnome.org GNOME Foundation] coordinates the development and other aspects of the GNOME Project. 

=== The Software ===

GNOME is a desktop environment and a development platform. This piece of free software is the desktop of choice for several industry leaders. It is interesting both for business users, home users as well as developers. 

=== The Community ===

Like with any big free software project, GNOME has an extensive user and development base. [http://planet.gnome.org GnomePlanet] is a popular blog aggregator for GNOME hackers and contributors whereas [http://developer.gnome.org Developer.Gnome.Org] is for the GNOME developers. [http://library.gnome.org/users/ GNOME Library] contains a huge list of GNOME resources for end users. The [http://worldofgnome.org/ World of GNOME] is also a popular aggregator for GNOME-related news.

== Installing GNOME ==

=== What do you need? ===

{{Important|First read and follow the instructions in the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration X Server Configuration Howto] to setup your X environment.}}

Before you start installing GNOME, you might want to edit your USE variables. Make sure that <code>X</code> , <code>gtk</code> , and <code>gnome</code> are in your USE variable listed in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} . If you want support for <code>dbus</code> , a system message bus Gnome uses extensively, add it to your USE flags. If you don't want KDE support (the other big desktop environment), remove <code>qt4</code> and <code>kde</code>. 

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Example flags for a GNOME environment|<pre>
USE="-qt4 -kde X dbus gtk gnome"
</pre>
}}

You can add the <code>branding</code> USE flag to get a lovely Gentoo-branded splashscreen instead of the default GNOME splashscreen: 

{{RootCmd|echo "gnome-base/gnome-session branding" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{Note|If you use a <code>desktop/gnome</code> profile, these USE flags will be set for you. You can check your profile by running <code>eselect profile list</code> and <code>eselect profile set <profile-name></code> as root.}}

Once done, start installing GNOME by emerging <code>gnome</code> : 

{{RootCmd|emerge gnome-base/gnome}}

You can also opt for a minimal GNOME installation using <code>gnome-light</code>. If you do so, you will have a lightweight GNOME installation without the additional tools that a full GNOME installation provides so you might need to install additional packages afterwards.

{{RootCmd|emerge gnome-base/gnome-light}}
{{Note|<code>gnome-light</code> does not pull in <code>gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver</code>, which is needed for locking the screen.}}



This will take a while, so you might want to start reading all those books your mother bought you but you never opened. Done? Great, now update your environment variables: 

{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

Next we'll clean up the remaining services and user groups. 

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus start
|rc-update add dbus default}}

Check if the ''plugdev'' group exists. If it does, it is adviseable to make yourself member of that group, but this is optional (the group is not that common anymore). 

{{RootCmd|getent group plugdev|output=<pre>
plugdev:x:104:
</pre>}}

Substitute yourUserName with your user name.

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a yourUserName plugdev}}

=== First Impressions ===

Let us first take a look at what we just built. Exit your root shell and log on as a regular user. We will configure our session to run GNOME when we issue the <code>startx</code> command (see also [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration#Using_startx Using startx] in the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration X Server Configuration Howto] ): 

{{Cmd|echo "exec gnome-session" > ~/.xinitrc}}

Starting with <code>gnome-base/gnome-session-2.26.2</code> , you will need to prepend the XDG_MENU_PREFIX variable to get the GNOME menus if you're using the {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} method to start your desktop. (If you're not using {{Path|~/.xinitrc}}, it will be handled automatically for you; no additional configuration is needed.) 

{{Cmd|sed -i '1i\export XDG_MENU_PREFIX{{=}}gnome-' ~/.xinitrc}}

Now start your graphical environment by running <code>startx</code> : 

{{Cmd|startx}}

If all goes well, you should be greeted by GNOME. Congratulations. Now let us take a look at how you can configure GNOME to suit your needs.

= More info =

* The [[GNOME/gdm|gdm]] page describes how to setup the Gnome Display Manager to automatically boot into a graphical environment (rather than starting a GNOME session through <code>startx</code>).
