The '''WD Black2''' is a dual hybrid drive solution from Western Digital with a 120GB SSD coupled with a 1TB traditional rotating media on a single SATA device. Factory configuration of the drive allows a SATA host to only recognize the 120GB capacity per the SSD.

The 1TB media is "unlocked" via a Windows installer tool available from Western Digital's product website. Although the '''WD Black2''' seems to be a device that only works with Microsoft Windows, the installer simply "unlocks" the upper 1TB and partitions the drive in 2 parts to distinguish between storage on the SSD and storage on the HDD. Once the HDD storage is unlocked, it may be used on Linux distribution and this article will explain how to set this up.

== Unlocking the 1TB HDD ==
Unfortunately, physical access to a machine running Microsoft Windows is required for this step. If your drive shows capacity of 1120GB in the BIOS, you may skip this portion.

# Connect the '''WD Black2''' to a system with a free SATA port and boot into Microsoft Windows
## Use a system that is already running Microsoft Windows and connect drive as a slave
## Install Microsoft Windows onto the drive from scratch.
# Run the WD Black2 installer which can be downloaded from the [http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=1190 product page]
# Confirm that you are able to see 1120GB capacity in the BIOS
