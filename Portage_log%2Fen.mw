When using {{c|emerge}} for building a package, it is not uncommon to notice messages coming from [[Portage]] itself. Since they may contain important information from Gentoo developers it is a good idea to read them, but often this is not immediately possible because they rapidly scroll out of the screen. This can be easily solved by enabling a Portage [[FEATURES|feature]] called elog, whose purpose is to save messages to disk for later review. But other logging capabilities exist as well...

== Portage elog subsystem ==

The Portage elog subsystem keeps track of specific, ebuild-provided log messages that developers have put in the [[ebuild]]s to attract attention of the administrator or user. Often, these messages contain important or interesting information related to the build of said package.

=== Setup ===

Select which kind of information should be logged through the <var>PORTAGE_ELOG_CLASSES</var> variable. Possible values are <code>info</code>, <code>warn</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>log</code> and <code>qa</code>:

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]|lang=bash|1=
PORTAGE_ELOG_CLASSES="log warn error"
}}

=== Configuring for file-based storage ===

Portage can handle the elog events in a number of ways.

In order to save the elog events to disk, enable the <code>save</code> module in the <code>PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM</code> variable:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="save"
}}

The messages will be saved in {{Path|/var/log/portage/elog}} or in {{Path|${PORT_LOGDIR}/elog}} if said variable is set.

In order to create per-category elog files, enable the <code>split-elog</code> Portage feature. It will force Portage to create category-based subdirectories of the {{Path|/var/log/portage/elog}} location.

=== Configuring for e-mail ===

To mail logs to a recipient, enable the <code>mail</code> module. The mail option requires some additional variables to be set. Read {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/make.conf.example}} for more information.

Below, an example setup is shown which is hopefully self-explanatory:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="mail"
# First the mail-to address, then the SMTP server
PORTAGE_ELOG_MAILURI="log-intake@example.com mail.example.com"
PORTAGE_ELOG_MAILFROM="portage@$(hostname).example.com"
PORTAGE_ELOG_MAILSUBJECT="${PACKAGE} is ${ACTION} on ${HOST}"
}}

Another example with nullmailer or sendmail:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="mail"
# First the mail-to address, then the SMTP server
PORTAGE_ELOG_MAILURI="users@host /usr/sbin/sendmail"
PORTAGE_ELOG_MAILFROM="portage@$(hostname).example.com"
PORTAGE_ELOG_MAILSUBJECT="${PACKAGE} is ${ACTION} on ${HOST}"
}}

The following is a list of elog-related software packages:

* {{Package|app-portage/elogv}} - Curses based utility to parse the contents of elogs
* {{Package|app-portage/elogviewer}} - Python based elog viewer

== Build logs ==

With the Portage elog subsystem, package build logs are saved on disk or mailed to a remote recipient, regardless of failure or success. This allows for administrators to review builds later or retrieve build logs for support tickets.

=== Setup ===

To enable Portage logging, edit {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]}} and set <var>PORT_LOGDIR</var> to a location where the log files should be stored. By default, Portage will use {{Path|/var/log/portage}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
PORT_LOGDIR="/var/log/portage"
}}

Next, a number of <code>FEATURES</code> settings influence how Portage handles build logs.

* With <code>binpkg-logs</code> set, even binary package deployments will have their logs saved
* When <code>clean-logs</code> is set, regular log file clean operations are executed. The command that is executed is defined by <var>PORT_LOGDIR_CLEAN</var> and defaults to a retention of the files of 7 days.
* With <code>split-log</code> set, build logs are stored in category-named subdirectories of <code>${PORT_LOGDIR}/build</code>

=== Cleaning up ===

When <code>clean-logs</code> is set, Portage will execute the command defined by <var>PORT_LOGDIR_CLEAN</var> after every build or unmerge operation. By default, the following command is used:

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/portage/config/make.globals|lang=bash|1=
PORT_LOGDIR_CLEAN="find \"\${PORT_LOGDIR}\" -type f ! -name \"summary.log*\" -mtime +7 -delete"
}}

When defining a custom command, do not forget to ''escape'' the <code>${PORT_LOGDIR}</code> variable (or immediately hardcode the right location).
