'''Ratpoison''' is a tiling window manager modelled after screen. The main philosophy under ratpoison is to manage the windows without using a mouse (what the name reflects). Being written in C, it is extremely light-weight and fast.

==Installation==

Install {{Package|x11-wm/ratpoison}}:
{{emerge|x11-wm/ratpoison}}

==Configuration==

===Starting===
You need to edit ~/.xinitrc and add there the following line:

{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>
exec /usr/bin/ratpoison
</pre>}}

===Startup file===

On startup ratpoison runs commands found in the file ~/.ratpoisonrc. This file contains key bindings and programs that need to be run with ratpoison.

Here's an example of ~/.ratpoisonrc

{{File|~/.ratpoisonrc||<pre>
# Add key bindings
bind c exec urxvt

# What programs do we run on startup?
exec numlockx
</pre>}}
