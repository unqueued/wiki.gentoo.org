'''ratpoison''' is [[Article description::a tiling [[window manager]] modeled after <tt>screen</tt>.]] The main philosophy behind ratpoison is to manage window without using a mouse (what it's name reflects). Being written in C, it is extremely lightweight and fast.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-wm/ratpoison}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|x11-wm/ratpoison}}:

{{emerge|x11-wm/ratpoison}}

== Configuration ==

=== Starting ===

Edit {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} in the user's home directory by adding the following line:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec /usr/bin/ratpoison
}}

=== Startup file ===

Being a simple window manager, ratpoison does not need much out-of-the-box configuration. Customizable settings can be adjusted to each user's needs by editing ratpoison's start up file.

On start up ratpoison runs commands found in the {{Path|~/.ratpoisonrc}} file. This file contains key bindings and programs that need to be run with ratpoison. Here is an example of a {{Path|~/.ratpoisonrc}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.ratpoisonrc|1=
# Add key bindings:
bind c exec /usr/bin/urxvt
bind e exec /usr/bin/urxvt -e /usr/bin/emacs
bind m exec /usr/bin/urxvt -bg black -fg white -e /usr/bin/mitmproxy
bind f exec /usr/bin/firefox

# What programs should be ran on start up?
exec /usr/bin/numlockx

# Initiate here the number of desired workspaces:
exec /usr/bin/rpws init 6 -k
}}

== Usage ==

Since ratpoison is modeled after <tt>screen</tt>, users accustomed to <tt>screen</tt> will easily manage to use it. Each command begins with a {{Key|Ctrl}}-{{Key|t}} (abbreviated C-t from now on), and is followed by one other keystroke. The simplest way to get to know the commands is to press C-t ? This will open a help window containing the most common key bindings.

Most commonly used keys:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Keystroke !! Description
|-
| C-t C-c || Execute xterm
|-
| C-t ! || Spawn a shell executing shell command, usually an application, such as C-t ! firefox {{Key|Enter}}
|-
| C-t k || Close the current window
|-
| C-t b || Banish the rat cursor to the lower right corner of the screen. The next step would be to unplug the rat from the computer altogether.
|-
| C-t C-t || Switch to the window that was last accessed but is not currently visible
|-
| C-t s || Split the current frame into upper frame and a lower frame. By default, split in halves.
|-
| C-t S || Split the current frame into left frame and a right frame.
|-
| C-t r || Resize the current frame interactively by pressing {{Key|Up}} and {{Key|Down}} keys. Hit {{Key|Enter}} when finished.
|-
| C-t R || Remove the current frame and extend some frames around to fill the remaining gap.
|-
| C-t :quit || Run before exiting ratpoison
|-
| C-t a || Output current data and time
|-
| C-t C-g || Do nothing and that successfully
|}

{{Note|All windows are maximized to the full screen size.}}

== Tips ==

By default, ratpoison only has one workspace. Add the following line to the {{Path|~/.ratpoisonrc}} file in order to create six workspaces:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.ratpoisonrc|lang=bash|1=
exec /usr/bin/rpws init 6 -k
}}

Switch between workspaces with {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|F1}}, {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|F2}}, etc.
