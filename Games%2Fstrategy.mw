FreeCiv is a free 2D turn based strategy game inspired by the Sid Meier's Civilization series. The gameplay is like that of the Civilization series, in which the goal is to lead a civilization from 4000 B.C. until however the game ends. The player can discover technologies, conduct diplomacy and/or wage war, build cities and many other things. The game may end when a set year is reached, when one civilization has eradicated all the others, or when one civilization has accomplished the goal of space colonization. These are different win conditions that may be enabled or disabled. This type of customisability of the gameplay rules is characteristic of FreeCiv which has a list of settings that are probably overwhelming to new players but very rewarding once you get the hang of the game. It is a very deep game with very deep gameplay. FreeCiv has networked multiplayer (LAN or Internet). It may be played in several different clients. In Portage, we have the GTK2 and the SDL clients (use gtk and/or sdl USE-flags), of which the GTK2 one is arguably the most pleasant. The game may also be played online in your browser using the [http://play.freeciv.org HTML5 version].

Hedgewars is a turn based strategy, artillery, action and comedy game, featuring the antics of pink hedgehogs with attitude as they battle from the depths of hell to the depths of space. Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs: during the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game. Hedgewars features the standard artillery-genre classics (such as Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, Shotgun), but also boasts a host of other weapons quite unique to it alone.

[[File:OpenTTD shot.png|thumb|right|200px|[https://secure.openttd.org/www/en/screenshots media]]]
OpenTTD is a free real-time strategy game. It was originally one of many extensions of the proprietary Transport Tycoon Deluxe. Then it was an effort to reverse engineer it to have a fully free Transport Tycoon clone, retaining the extensions. It has since not only achieved its goal of remaking Transport Tycoon Deluxe, but also vastly surpassed the original game with a huge amount of unique features. For those who haven't played Transport Tycoon, OpenTTD is a planning and simulation and strategy game in which the player founds a transport company. The player must make this company successful through transportation of passengers and freight. There are trains, trams, cars, buses, aeroplanes, boats and more vehicles to enable this. The player must construct train stations, bus stations, etc. -- and also railways, roads etc to connect these as well as the towns and industries on the map. The gameplay is incredibly deep, and probably perplexing for newcomers -- but leads to some truly unique experiences once you get to know it. The game is also highly configurable and customisable. It lets you not only tweak seemingly all game rules, but also change the graphics, sounds, AI scripts and more. OpenTTD features networked multiplayer (LAN or Internet).
