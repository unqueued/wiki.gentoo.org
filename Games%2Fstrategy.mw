FreeCiv is a free 2D turn based strategy game inspired by the Sid Meier's Civilization series. The gameplay is like that of the Civilization series, in which the goal is to lead a civilization from 4000 B.C. until however the game ends. The player can discover technologies, conduct diplomacy and/or wage war, build cities and many other things. The game may end when a set year is reached, when one civilization has eradicated all the others, or when one civilization has accomplished the goal of space colonization. These are different win conditions that may be enabled or disabled. This type of customisability of the gameplay rules is characteristic of FreeCiv which has a list of settings that are probably overwhelming to new players but very rewarding once you get the hang of the game. It is a very deep game with very deep gameplay. FreeCiv has networked multiplayer (LAN or Internet). It may be played in several different clients. In Portage, we have the GTK2 and the SDL clients (use gtk and/or sdl USE-flags), of which the GTK2 one is arguably the most pleasant. The game may also be played online in your browser using the [http://play.freeciv.org HTML5 version].
