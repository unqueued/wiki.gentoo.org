Blu-ray is the optical media successor to DVD. As a medium, it is designed to hold more storage. For multimedia, it is intended to store higher quality content than DVDs, such as movies and shows in 720p, 1080p video resolution and higher, plus audio tracks with higher bitrates and number of channels, such as DTS-HD Master.

Similar to DVDs, the file storage format is UDF. The content on the discs are also protected with encryption, namely AACS (Advanced Access Content System).

There are a number of applications in portage to access Blu-ray discs and media, including ones to bypass the encryption.
