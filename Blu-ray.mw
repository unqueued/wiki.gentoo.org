Blu-ray is the optical media successor to DVD. As a medium, it is designed to hold more storage. For multimedia, it is intended to store higher quality content than DVDs, such as movies and shows in 720p, 1080p video resolution and higher, plus audio tracks with higher bitrates and number of channels, such as DTS-HD Master.

Similar to DVDs, the file storage format is UDF. The content on the discs are also protected with encryption, namely AACS (Advanced Access Content System).

There are a number of applications in portage to access Blu-ray discs and media, including ones to bypass the encryption.

== Device Access ==

{{Important|Your user must be added to the '''cdrom''' group to access a hardware Blu-ray disc drive.}}

Check if your user is already in the '''cdrom''' group:

{{Cmd|groups|output=<pre>users cdrom</pre>}}

Add your user to the '''cdrom''' group if needed:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a user cdrom}}

As with any time a user is added to a new group, they must either log out and back in as that user, or switch using '''su''' to gain new abilities.

{{Cmd|su - user|groups|output=<pre>users cdrom</pre>}}

== Encryption ==

{{Package|media-libs/libbluray}} will use {{Package|media-libs/libaacs}} to bypass encryption. It requires a {{Path|KEYDB.cfg}} text file that has all the current set of keys necessary. You can find one in [http://vlc-bluray.whoknowsmy.name/ various] [http://bluray.beandog.org/keydb/ places] online.

Save the file to {{Path|~/.config/aacs/KEYDB.cfg}}

== Disc Information ==

Blu-ray discs have both "titles" or "tracks", similar to DVD tracks, but also "playlists" as well. This can make it a bit confusing when trying to get information or rip media from a disc. Generally speaking, ripping a playlist will cover a common use case.

=== libbluray ===

The package {{Package|media-libs/libbluray}} contains a few programs to help out.

Use {{Path|bd_info}} to list details of a disc:

{{Cmd|bd_info /dev/sr0|output=<pre>Using libbluray version 1.0.2

== Ripping Blu-rays ==

Two programs in portage can be used to copy Blu-ray titles and playlists to disc: namely, {{Package|media-libs/libbluray}} again, which is open source and command line only, and {{Package|media-video/makemkv}} which is partially open source and has both command line and GUI applications.

=== libbluray ===

With {{Package|media-libs/libbluray}}, you can use '''bdsplice''' to copy a title or playlist to disk. You will have to get the index number from above, using as examples '''list_titles''' or '''bluray_info''' for references.

The container for multimedia files are MPEG2 transport streams, so we will save it with an '''m2ts''' extension.

{{Cmd|bdsplice -t 6 /dev/sr0 bluray_title_06.m2ts}}

=== MakeMKV ===

MakeMKV is a partially-closed source program, and does not require a {{Path|KEYDB.cfg}} file to decrypt disc access. It has both a command-line application, '''makemkvcon''' and a Qt application '''MakeMKV'''.

{{Note|The title and playlist indexes displayed by MakeMKV and the ones from libbluray will not necessarily match. Also, the titles are zero-indexed. So title '''1''' one libbluray, would be title '''0''' with MakeMKV.}}

==== Command Line ====

'''makemkvcon''', the command line application, can rip content from three sources: a disc in your Blu-ray drive (a character device on your system, such as '''/dev/sr0'''), a mounted Blu-ray filesytem, and a copied Blu-ray image.

Copy the first title from the disc (remember that they are zero indexed) to the current directory:

{{Cmd|makemkvcon --minlength{{=}}0 mkv dev:/dev/sr0 0 .}}

Copy the first title from a mounted directory:

{{Cmd|makemkvcon --minlength{{=}}0 mkv file:/mnt/bluray}}

Copy the first title from an image:

{{Cmd|makemkvcon --minlength{{=}}0 mkv iso:bluray_movie.iso}}

==== GUI ====

The program '''MakeMKV''' is a Qt application, and quite self-explanatory once started.
