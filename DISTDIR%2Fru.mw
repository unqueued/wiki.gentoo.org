The <var>DISTDIR</var> variable defines the location where Portage will store the downloaded source code archives. Its value defaults to {{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles}}.

This location, which is also often referred to as the ''distfiles'' location, will host the source code archives of all software installed (or attempted to install) on the system. This location is not automatically cleaned up, so users should consider using tools such as the {{c|eclean-dist}} command (which comes as part of the {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} package) to keep the storage used by this location under control. Read the [[Eclean|Eclean article]] for more details.

Users can set the <var>DISTDIR</var> variable in [[:/etc/portage/make.conf|{{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}]]
