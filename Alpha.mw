The {{Keyword|alpha}} is a 64 bit RISC architecture supported within Gentoo through the [[Project:Alpha|Gentoo Alpha Project]]. 

Server/workstation class processor family named Alpha implemented this architecture. Both processors and architecture were developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Production of Alpha based systems ran from 1992 to 2007. DEC was acquired by Compaq and later Hewlett-Packard resulting in ceasing the development of Alpha.

Major processor revisions:
* Alpha 21064/EV4
* Alpha 21064A/EV45
* Alpha 21164/EV5
* Alpha 21164A/EV56
* Alpha 21264/EV6
* Alpha 21264A/EV67
* Alpha 21364/EV7
