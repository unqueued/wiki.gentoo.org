Portage categories {{package category | acct-group}} and {{package category | acct-user}} are explained here.
{{warning | This page may not be correct enough. It is not yet reviewed by Gentoo developers.}}

== TL;DR ==
Some packages pull in  {{package category | acct-group}} and {{package category | acct-user}}. Simply leave them as-is, and don't mind; they're like "virtual" or "perl-core" packages.

== Explanation ==
They came to existence by [https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0081.html GLEP 81] in 2019.	

The packages in these categories are not "real"; they are simply provided to control, in a systematic and ordered manner, (Linux) users and groups.

Notice first some packages need user/group accounts. However, it's not so simple as it may first sound. It's because e.g.:

* Some packages share the same user/group.
* This means UIDs/GIDs have to be reliably shared, too.
* Some user/group become obsolete, but how can it be tracked?

To solve such problems, these categories do exist.
