'''LILO (Linux Loader)''' is a boot loader to load linux and other operating systems.

== Installation ==

LILO's installation is two-fold. One is the installation of the software itself on the system (but does not activate LILO), the second one is the installation (activation) of the LILO bootloader on the disk's MBR.

=== Useflags ===

{{USEflag
|package=sys-boot/lilo
|static
|minimal
|pxeserial
|device-mapper
}}

=== Emerge ===

The software installation will only deploy the software on the file system, but will not install LILO in the MBR.

{{emerge|lilo}}

=== Installing LILO on the MBR ===

In order to install LILO on the MBR, just invoke <code>lilo</code>. However, before doing that, the {{Path|/etc/lilo.conf}} file must be set up.

{{RootCmd|lilo}}

== Configuring LILO ==

An example {{Path|lilo.conf}} file is provided at {{Path|/etc/lilo.conf.example}}.

Lilo's default configuration has hda references, lets change those to sda recursively using sed.

{{RootCmd|sed -i -e 's/hda/sda/' /etc/lilo.conf.example}}

Now we copy the example configuration to the running configuration.

{{RootCmd|cp /etc/lilo.conf.example /etc/lilo.conf}}

=== Default OS ===

To change default booting os.

{{file|/etc/lilo.conf||<pre>
# MBR to install LILO to:
boot = /dev/sda
map = /boot/.map
default = Gentoo
</pre>}}

=== Timeout ===

To have lilo auto start after a set time.

{{file|/etc/lilo.conf||<pre>
# If you always want to see the prompt with a 15 second timeout:
timeout=150</pre>}}

=== Silence ===

For silent kernel unpacking at boot

{{file|/etc/lilo.conf||<pre>
	label = Gentoo
	read-only # read-only for checking
	append = "quiet"
</pre>}}

=== systemd ===

For systemd instead of openrc

{{file|/etc/lilo.conf||<pre>
	label = Gentoo-systemd
	read-only # read-only for checking
	append = "quiet init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd"
</pre>}}

=== Old Configs ===

It is a good idea to keep an old image around in case problems crop up in new kernel builds.

{{File|/etc/lilo.conf||<pre>
image = /boot/bzImage.old
        root = /dev/sda3
        #root = /devices/discs/disc0/part3
        label = Gentooold
        read-only # read-only for checking
</pre>}}

== Kernel Linking ==

Using symlinks is a good idea to be able to determine if the loader is loading the correct image, and enable tab auto completion to ensure we are loading what we intend to.

{{RootCmd|ln -s /boot/vmlinuz-version /boot/bzImage}}

{{RootCmd|ln -s /boot/vmlinuz-version.old /boot/bzImage.old}}

{{note|if you do not use make install to build your kernel you must run lilo to load the new kernel images}}
