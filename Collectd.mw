'''collectd''' is [[Article description::a daemon that regularly collects, transfers, and stores system information.]] It is typically used for collecting performance information and other system data like disk, memory, and network usage, and from many other sources using a number of plugins. [https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/List_of_front-ends Other software] can then be used to read databases of collected information to plot it and analyze it.

== Installation ==

=== USE Flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-metrics/collectd}}

=== Emerge ===

First, determine which plugins you want on your system. The collectd wiki contains a [https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins list of plugins], or check the ''collectd'' [[man page]]. These plugins are specified as USE flags with a <code>collectd_plugins_</code> prefix, though these can also be specified with a <code>COLLECTD_PLUGINS</code> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Define some plugins with COLLECTD_PLUGINS|lang=bash|1=
COLLECTD_PLUGINS="load memory syslog"
}}

collectd requires a plugin to enable any sort of logging. Make sure you enable the [https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:SysLog syslog plugin] and/or the [https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:LogFile logfile plugin].

To write data, you need to enable write plugins. The [https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:RRDtool rrdtool plugin] is a common plugin. Data can be written to other collectd daemons using the [https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Network network plugin].

To install:

{{Emerge|app-metrics/collectd}}

== Configuration ==

With collectd and some plugins installed, enable them in the configuration file by uncommenting them, for instance, the syslog plugin:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/collectd.conf|title=Enabling syslog|1=
LoadPlugin syslog
<Plugin syslog>
        LogLevel info  
</Plugin>
}}

=== rrdtool plugin ===

Default location for saving the rrd files by collectd is BaseDir but that will mix the rrdtool's files with other plugins. So redefine it.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/collectd.conf|1=
<Plugin rrdtool>
        DataDir "/var/lib/collectd/rrd"
</Plugin>
}}

=== Service ===

To start collectd on start-up:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add collectd default}}

== Troubleshooting ==

Check the logs for errors after starting up to make sure everything is going smoothly.
