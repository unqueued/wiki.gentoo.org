{{Note|This is a shortened list of USE flags you might want, a full List is available on [http://znurt.org znurt.org]}}
You can install Texlive with the following command:
{{ShellRoot|emerge -av app-text/texlive}}

== Usage ==
Most of the time you will use TeX Live through some LaTeX editor of your choice. To compile a .tex document into pdf from commandline using different compiler:
LaTeX:
{{Shell|pdflatex mydocument.tex}}
XeTeX:
{{Shell|xelatex mydocument.tex}}
LuaTeX:
{{Shell|lualatex mydocument.tex}}

=== Editors ===
There are several you can choose from in Gentoo. To list a few pure TeX editors:
* {{Package|app-editors/kile}} - KDE based editor, which lets you write in LaTeX code and then compile the document
* {{Package|app-office/texmaker}} - QT based editor, which lets you write in LaTeX code and then compile the document
* {{Package|app-editors/gummi}} - GTK based editor, which lets you write in LaTeX code and then compile the document
* {{Package|app-office/lyx}} - GTK based editor, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG WYSIWYG], you type directly into the LaTeX document and can edit LaTeX code afterwards
This is by far not a complete list.<br />
Most of the editors support LaTeX syntax highlighting like {{Package|app-editors/vim}}, {{Package|app-editors/gedit}} or {{Package|dev-util/geany}} and most development IDE's provide some plugins like {{Package|dev-util/eclipse-sdk}} and {{Package|dev-util/netbeans}}.

=== Programs with LaTeX support ===
* {{Package|net-im/pidgin}} - has a LaTeX plugin to display mathematical formulae

=== eselect pdftex ===
Gentoo provides a script that enables you to easily switch between different TeX Live distributions:
{{ShellRoot|emerge app-admin/eselect-pdftex}}
You can list available distributions with the following command:
{{ShellRoot|eselect pdftex list}}
To set the distribution:
{{ShellRoot|eselect pdftex set 1}}

=== texdoc ===
Shows the original TeX documentation by keywords. For example everything about ''article'':
{{Shell|texdoc article}}
This should open your default pdf viewer and show you the documentation.<br/>
In order to use ''texdoc'', you need to have the ''doc'' USE flag enabled for Texlive and any module you want to have documentation about. A full list of installed TeX modules can be listed with the following command:
{{ShellRoot|qlist -C -I texlive}}
Add those to /etc/portage/package.use if you do not want to use the ''doc'' USE flag globally in your /etc/make.conf
