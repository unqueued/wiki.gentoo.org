'''TeX Live''' is [[Article description::a complete [[Wikipedia:TeX|TeX]] distribution with several programs to create professional documents.]]

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-text/texlive}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-text/texlive}}:

{{Emerge|app-text/texlive}}

{{Note|When wanting to merge multiple Doxygen PDF files into one PDF file, or book style PDF preferable for E-Reading devices; it is likely the {{Package|dev-texlive/texlive-latexextra}} package will be needed to be installed. (i.e. {{c|pdflatex refman.tex}})}}

== Usage ==

Most of the time users will implement TeX Live through the editor of choice. The following is a list of compilers capable of translating a {{Path|.tex}} document into {{Path|.pdf}} file:

LaTeX:

{{Cmd|pdflatex mydocument.tex}}

XeTeX:

{{Cmd|xelatex mydocument.tex}}

LuaTeX:

{{Cmd|luatex mydocument.tex}}

=== Editors ===

There are several editors users can choose from in Gentoo. To list a few pure TeX editors:

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|-
! Editor !! Package !! Homepage !! Description
|-
| kile || {{Package|app-editors/kile}} || http://kile.sourceforge.net/ || A [[KDE]] based editor, which lets users write in LaTeX code and then compile the document.
|-
| texmaker || {{Package|app-office/texmaker}} || http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/ || A [[Qt]] based editor, which lets user write in LaTeX code and then compile the document

|-
| latexila || {{Package|app-editors/latexila}} || https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/LaTeXila || [[GNOME]] based editor, which lets users write in LaTeX code and then compile the document
|-
| lyx || {{Package|app-office/lyx}} || http://www.lyx.org/ || Qt based [[Wikipedia:WYSIWYM|WYSIWYM]] editor, users type directly into the LaTeX document and can edit LaTeX code afterwards
|-

{{Note|The above table is not a comprehensive list of tex editors.}}

Most editors support LaTeX syntax highlighting like [[Vim]], [[emacs]] (which supports compilation and previewing), [[gedit]] or [[gleany]] and most development IDE's provide some plugins like {{Package|dev-util/eclipse-sdk}} and {{Package|dev-util/netbeans}}.

=== Programs with LaTeX support ===

* {{Package|net-im/pidgin}} - has a LaTeX plugin to display mathematical formulae.
* {{Package|app-misc/freemind}} - has a LaTeX plugin for inserting formulae in mind maps.

=== Find the Gentoo package that contains a tex package ===
{{Package|dev-tex/texmfind}} contains a program to search for the Gentoo package containing a tex package. For example, <kbd>texmfind bbm.sty</kbd> returns {{Package|dev-texlive/texlive-fontsextra}}.

=== eselect pdftex ===

Gentoo would automatically clean out any previous version during upgrade. In order to intentionally install several versions into different [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/slotting/index.html slots] a script exists that enables easy switching:

{{Emerge|app-eselect/eselect-pdftex}}

List available distributions with the following command:

{{RootCmd|eselect pdftex list}}

To set the distribution:

{{RootCmd|eselect pdftex set 1}}

=== texdoc ===

Shows the original TeX documentation by keywords. For example everything about ''article'':

{{Cmd|texdoc article}}

This should open the default PDF viewer with the documentation.

In order to use the {{c|texdoc}} command, the <code>doc</code> USE flag enabled for TeX Live and any other module which users would like documentation available. 

To enable the <code>doc</code> USE flag on any TeX Live module automatically, use a wildcard:

{{RootCmd|echo dev-texlive/* doc >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

A full list of installed TeX modules can be shown with the following command:

{{RootCmd|qlist -C -I texlive}}

To enable the <code>doc</code> USE flag only for certain modules, add them to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}}. A quick way of adding them all is by running this command:

{{RootCmd|qlist -C -I texlive {{!}} sed 's/$/ doc/' >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{Note|Afterwards edit the USE flags for each module in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} individually}}
