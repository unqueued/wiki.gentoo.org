== Usage ==
...

=== eselect pdftex ===
Gentoo provides a script that enables you to easily switch between different TeX Live distributions:
{{ShellRoot|emerge app-admin/eselect-pdftex}}
You can list available distributions with the following command:
{{ShellRoot|eselect pdftex list}}
To set the distribution:
{{ShellRoot|eselect pdftex set 1}}

=== texdoc ===
Shows the original TeX documentation by keywords. For example everything about ''article'':
{{Shell|texdoc article}}
In order to use ''texdoc'', you need to have the ''doc'' USE flag enabled for Texlive and any module you want to have documentation about. A full list of installed TeX modules can be listed with the following command:
{{ShellRoot|qlist -C -I texlive}}
Add those to /etc/portage/package.use if you do not want to use the ''doc'' USE flag globally in your /etc/make.conf
