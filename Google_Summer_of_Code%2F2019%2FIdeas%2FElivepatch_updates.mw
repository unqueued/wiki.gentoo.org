{{GSoCIdea|year=2019|Elivepatch updates|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Elivepatch is a distributed live patch system implemented in Gentoo based on kpatch-build. Elivepatch is trying to automatize the live patch creation and installation in a different kernel user base by reproducing the same system. 
Elivepatch still need many work. For example we need a better testing environment and logger interface. We also need a reproduction of the GCC version as in the client system.
