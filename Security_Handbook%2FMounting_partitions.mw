When mounting an [[ext2]], [[ext3]], or [[reiserfs]] partition, you have several options you can apply to the file {{Path|/etc/fstab}}. The options are:

* <code>nosuid</code> - Will ignore the SUID bit and make it just like an ordinary file.
* <code>noexec</code> - Will prevent execution of files from this partition.
* <code>nodev</code> - Ignores devices.

Unfortunately, these settings can easily be circumvented by executing a non-direct path. However, setting {{Path|/tmp}} to <code>noexec</code> will stop the majority of exploits designed to be executed directly from {{Path|/tmp}}.

{{Warning|Placing {{Path|/tmp}} in <code>noexec</code> mode can prevent certain legitimate scripts from executing properly.}}

{{Note|For disk quotas see the [[Security_Handbook/User/Group_limitations#Quotas|Quotas section]].}}

{{Note|I do not set {{Path|/var}} to <code>noexec</code> or <code>nosuid</code>, even if files normally are never executed from this mount point. The reason for this is that {{Package|mail-mta/netqmail}} is installed in {{Path|/var/qmail}} and must be allowed to execute and access one SUID file. I setup {{Path|/usr}} in read-only mode since I never write anything there unless I want to update Gentoo. Then I remount the file system in read-write mode, update and remount again.}}

{{Note|Even if you do not use {{Package|mail-mta/netqmail}}, Gentoo still needs the executable bit set on {{Path|/var/tmp}} since ebuilds are made here. But an alternative path can be setup if you insist on having {{Path|/var}} mounted in <code>noexec</code> mode.}}
