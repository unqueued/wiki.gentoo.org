<noinclude>[[Article description::System administrators should consider available security related mount options in order to harden any devices that are connected to the system.]]<noinclude>
<includeonly>== Mounting partitions ==</includeonly>
When [[mount#Usage|mounting]] an [[ext2]], [[ext3]], [[ext4]], or [[wikipedia:ReiserFS|reiserfs]] partition, a few security related mount options can be applied in {{Path|/etc/fstab}} file. The options are:

; <code>nosuid</code>: Ignores the SUID bit and makes it just like an ordinary file.
; <code>noexec</code>: Prevents execution of files from this mount point.
; <code>nodev</code>: Ignores devices.

Unfortunately, these settings can easily be circumvented by executing a non-direct path. However, mounting the {{Path|/tmp}} directory with <code>noexec</code> will stop the majority of exploits designed to be executed directly from temporary file systems.

For example, hardening the {{Path|/etc/fstab}} file may look something like the following:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
/dev/sda1          /boot      ext2     noauto,relatime                     1 2
/dev/sda2          none       swap     sw                                  0 0
/dev/sda3          /          ext4     relatime,errors=remount-ro          0 1
/dev/sda4          /var       reiserfs notail,relatime,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 2
/dev/sda5          /var/tmp   ext2     noatime,nodiratime,nodev,nosuid     0 2
/dev/sda6          /home      reiserfs notail,relatime,nodev,nosuid        0 2
/dev/sda7          /usr       reiserfs notail,relatime,nodev,ro            0 2
/dev/cdroms/cdrom0 /mnt/cdrom iso9660  noauto,ro                           0 0
none               /tmp       tmpfs    nodev,nosuid,noexec                 0 0
}}

Observe in the example that the {{Path|/usr}} mount point is set to read-only mode. This system has been designed to write nothing to {{path/usr}} until updates are being applied. When it is time for system updates, {{path|/usr}} is remounted in read-write mode, updated, then returned to read-only. This small trick has the potential to keep a server more secure.

{{Warning|Placing {{Path|/tmp}} in <code>noexec</code> mode can prevent certain legitimate scripts from executing properly.}}

Some programs (like {{Package|mail-mta/netqmail}}) will not be able to work properly if {{Path|/var}} has <code>noexec</code> and <code>nosuid</code>. Consider removing those options if they cause problems.
