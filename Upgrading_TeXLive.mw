TeXLive is a complex package with many dependencies. Here are some hints how to update it.

===Upgrading from texlive-2016 to texlive-2017 ===
{{c|qlist}} from the package {{Package|app-portage/portage-utils}} can list all installed texlive packages:

{{Cmd| qlist -I texlive}} 

This list can be used for a remove and merge command

{{Emerge| $(qlist -I texlive)|params+=-C --deselect=n}}

Optional: Finally set permissions: 
{{RootCmd|texconfig font ro # disable font generation for users}}
{{RootCmd|texconfig font rw # enable font generation for users}}
