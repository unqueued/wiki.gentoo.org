===Graphics===
The ao756 has a Intel 2nd Gen Core video controller. The following kernel config will work well. See the [[Intel|Gentoo Intel Page]] for further details. 
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Network device support  ---> 
        <*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
             <*> Intel 440LX/BX/GX, I8xx and E7x05 chipset support
        <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
            [*]   Enable modesetting on intel by default
</pre>}}



===Wireless===
Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
[*] Networking support  --->
    [*] Wireless  --->
        <*> cfg80211 - wireless configuration API
        <*> Generic IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack (mac80211)

    Device Drivers  --->
         [*] Network device support  --->
             [*] Wireless LAN  --->
                 <*>   Broadcom 43xx wireless support (mac80211 stack)
                 [ ]     Broadcom 43xx PCMCIA device support (NEW)
                 [*]   Support for 802.11n (N-PHY) devices (NEW)
                 [*]   Support for low-power (LP-PHY) devices (NEW)
                 [*]   Broadcom 43xx debugging
</pre>}}

===Ethernet===
Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetLink BCM57785 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe (rev 10)
{{kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
     [*] Network device support  --->
         [*]   Ethernet driver support  --->
              [*]   Broadcom devices
              < >     Broadcom 440x/47xx ethernet support
              < >     Broadcom NetXtremeII support
              < >     Broadcom CNIC support
              <*>     Broadcom Tigon3 support
</pre>}}




===Backlight===
In order to be able to control the backlight, the following changes will need to be applied to {{Path|/etc/default/grub}}.

{{File|/etc/default/grub||<pre>
#From
#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
</pre>
<pre>
#To
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux"
</pre>}}
Then execute <code>grub-mkconfig</code> to apply the changes: 
{{RootCmd|grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}
