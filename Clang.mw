clang is a compiler for C family of languages using LLVM as a backend and optimizer. It aims to be GCC compatible yet stricter.

== Using clang with portage ==

Although Gentoo package tree is not designed to be used with compiler other than GCC, clang can be enforced on most of the packages through ''CC'' and ''CXX'' variables.

Please note, however, that many of Gentoo packages still don't build with clang and a few don't work correctly after being built. That's why we suggest using ''/etc/portage/env'' file to enable the use of clang per-package.

In order to do that, first create a new environment override to use:

{{File|/etc/portage/env/clang|Environment override named ''clang''|<pre>
CC=clang
CXX=clang++
</pre>}}

Then you can enable use of clang for packages using ''/etc/portage/package.env'' file:

{{File|/etc/portage/package.env|Enabling ''clang'' for ''app-foo/bar'' and ''app-bar/baz''|<pre>
app-foo/bar clang
app-bar/baz clang
</pre>}}

If you have {{Package|app-portage/flaggie}} installed, the ''/etc/portage/package.env'' file could be modified using:

{{RootCmd|flaggie app-foo/bar app-bar/baz +clang}}
