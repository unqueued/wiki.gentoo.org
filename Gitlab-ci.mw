== Contents ==

If you know how to include a table of contents please insert one.

== Fore warning ==

The documentation as it stands is written from the point of view of some one who has GitLab running and wanted to include a continuous integration server aswell. Thus it may appear particular to one use case and not cover all situations.

== Layman ==

There is a layman overlay fro GitLab-CI this is available under the same overly providing GitLab, namely the CVUT overlay. It is installed as follows

    emerge -a www-apps/gitlab-ci

This produces the following installation message. This indicates the creation of a group and user called `gitlab_ci`

     * Adding group 'gitlab_ci' to your system ...
     *  - Groupid: next available
     * Adding user 'gitlab_ci' to your system ...
     *  - Userid: 104
     *  - Shell: /sbin/nologin
     *  - Home: /opt/gitlab-ci-7.8
     *  - Groups: gitlab_ci
     *  - GECOS: added by portage for gitlab-ci
     *  - Creating /opt/gitlab-ci-7.8 in /

(The above is listed to assist with future documentation efforts.)

== Gotchas ==

=== Paths ===

The initial emerge may fail if the folder /var/lib/gitlab_ci does not exist. Specifically this fails when gitlab tries to establish an SSH key.
