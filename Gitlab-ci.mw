== Layman ==

There is a layman overlay fro GitLab-CI this is available under the same overly providing GitLab, namely the CVUT overlay. It is installed as follows

    emerge -a www-apps/gitlab-ci

This produces the following installation message 

     * Adding group 'gitlab_ci' to your system ...
     *  - Groupid: next available
     * Adding user 'gitlab_ci' to your system ...
     *  - Userid: 104
     *  - Shell: /sbin/nologin
     *  - Home: /opt/gitlab-ci-7.8
     *  - Groups: gitlab_ci
     *  - GECOS: added by portage for gitlab-ci
     *  - Creating /opt/gitlab-ci-7.8 in /
