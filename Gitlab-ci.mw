== Contents ==

If you know how to include a table of contents please insert one.

== Fore warning ==

The documentation as it stands is written from the point of view of some one who has GitLab running and wanted to include a continuous integration server aswell. Thus it may appear particular to one use case and not cover all situations.

== Layman ==

There is a layman overlay fro GitLab-CI this is available under the same overly providing GitLab, namely the CVUT overlay. It is installed as follows

    emerge -a www-apps/gitlab-ci

This produces the following installation message. This indicates the creation of a group and user called `gitlab_ci`

     * Adding group 'gitlab_ci' to your system ...
     *  - Groupid: next available
     * Adding user 'gitlab_ci' to your system ...
     *  - Userid: 104
     *  - Shell: /sbin/nologin
     *  - Home: /opt/gitlab-ci-7.8
     *  - Groups: gitlab_ci
     *  - GECOS: added by portage for gitlab-ci
     *  - Creating /opt/gitlab-ci-7.8 in /

Once portage has done it's thing one is presented with the following information 

     * If this is a new installation, proceed with the following steps:
     *
     *   1. Copy /etc/gitlab-ci-7.8/application.yml.example to /etc/gitlab-ci-7.8/application.yml
     *      and edit this file in order to configure your GitLab CI settings.
     *
     *   2. Copy /etc/gitlab-ci-7.8/database.yml.* to /etc/gitlab-ci-7.8/database.yml
     *      and edit this file in order to configure your database settings
     *      for "production" environment.
     *
     *   3. Copy /etc/gitlab-ci-7.8/unicorn.rb.example to /etc/gitlab-ci-7.8/unicorn.rb
     *      and edit this file in order to configure your GitLab CI settings.
     *
     *   4. (Optional) If you want use SMTP:
     *      Copy /etc/gitlab-ci-7.8/initializers/smtp_settings.rb.sample to /etc/gitlab-ci-7.8/initializers/smtp_settings.rb
     *      and edit this file in order to configure your SMTP settings.
     *
     *   5. If this is a new installation, create a database for your GitLab CI instance.
     *     If you have local PostgreSQL running, just copy&run:
     *         su postgres
     *         psql -c "CREATE ROLE gitlab_ci PASSWORD 'gitlab_ci' \
     *             NOSUPERUSER CREATEDB NOCREATEROLE INHERIT LOGIN;"
     *         createdb -E UTF-8 -O gitlab_ci gitlab_ci_production
     *     Note: You should change your password to something more random...
     *
     *     GitLab CI uses polymorphic associations which are not SQL-standard friendly.
     *     To get it work you must use this ugly workaround:
     *         psql -U postgres -d gitlab_ci
     *         CREATE CAST (integer AS text) WITH INOUT AS IMPLICIT;
     *
     *   6. Execute the following command to finalize your setup:
     *          emerge --config "=www-apps/gitlab-ci-7.8.4"
     *      Note: Do not forget to start Redis server.
     *
     * To update an existing instance, run the following command and choose upgrading when prompted:
     *     emerge --config "=www-apps/gitlab-ci-7.8.4"
     *

== Gotchas ==

=== Paths ===

The initial emerge may fail if the folder /var/lib/gitlab_ci does not exist. Specifically this fails when gitlab tries to establish an SSH key.
