Switching between nVidias binary driver and the open source nouveau driver can be tricky, but definitely doable. This article will detail how to go about switching between them at different stages(i.e at boot, in a runlevel, etc.)

== On Boot ==
This method assumes the following:
* Two kernels, one with the nouveau driver enabled and one with the nouveau driver disabled(or built as a module).
* The nouveau-less kernel needs to have a ''-nvidia'' suffix(i.e CONFIG_LOCALVERSION=mykernel-nvidia).
* The GRUB bootloader.

We'll assume you already have a nouveau kernel and want to build the one that will use the nvidia driver. Begin with appending the ''-nvidia'' suffix to the kernel name:
{{Kernel||<pre>
General setup  --->
	(-mykernel-nvidia) Local version - append to kernel release
</pre>}}
Now make sure the nouveau driver is disabled or built as a module:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
	[*] Staging drivers  --->
		<M> Nouveau (nVidia) cards
</pre>}}
Now recompile and install the kernel. Make sure you update GRUB to take the new kernel into account. Note that kernels with the same version but with different names are considered unique. So if you want to emerge an out-of-tree kernel module to be used with the nouveau kernel you'll first need to copy over the nouveau kernels config file to /usr/src/linux/.config.

Set the '''''VIDEO_CARDS''''' variable in /etc/make.conf to "nvidia nouveau" and update your system:
{{RootCmd|emerge --newuse --deep @world}}
 
Blacklist the '''nvidia''' and '''nouveau''' modules as we don't want udev to try and autoload them.
{{RootCmd|echo "blacklist nvidia" >> /etc/modprobe/nvidia-n-nouveau.conf}}
{{RootCmd|echo "blacklist nouveau" >> /etc/modprobe/nvidia-n-nouveau.conf}}

And finally use the init script bellow to switch graphics driver depending on what kernel you booted with:
{{File|/etc/local.d/nvidia.start||<pre>
#!/bin/bash

depend() {
	need localmount
	before xdm
}

if [[ $(uname -r) == *-nvidia ]] ; then
	modprobe -q nvidia
	if [[ $(eselect opengl show) != nvidia ]] ; then
		eselect opengl set nvidia &>/dev/null
	fi
cat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-nvidia.conf << EOF
Section "Device"
  Identifier   "Device0"
  Driver       "nvidia"
  Option       "NoLogo" "True"
EndSection
EOF
else
	modprobe -q nouveau
	if [ -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-nvidia.conf ] ; then
		rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-nvidia.conf
	fi
	if [[ $(eselect opengl show) != xorg-x11 ]] ; then
		eselect opengl set xorg-x11 &>/dev/null
	fi
fi
</pre>}}
Copy it to /etc/local.d/nvidia.start and set the executable bit:
{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/local.d/nvidia.start}}
