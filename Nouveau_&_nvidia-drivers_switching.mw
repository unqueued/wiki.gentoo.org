Switching between [[nVidia/nvidia-drivers|nVidia's binary driver]] and the open source [[nouveau]] driver can be tricky, but definitely doable. This article will detail how to go about switching between them at different stages (i.e. at boot, in a runlevel, etc.)

== Switching using two kernels ==

=== On Boot ===
This method assumes the following:
* Two kernels, one with the nouveau driver enabled and one with the nouveau driver disabled (or built as a module).
* The nouveau-less kernel needs to have a ''-nvidia'' suffix.
* The [[GRUB]] bootloader.

It is assumed you already have a nouveau kernel and want to build the one that will use the nvidia driver. Begin with appending the ''-nvidia'' suffix to the kernel name:
{{Kernel||<pre>
General setup  --->
    (-mykernel-nvidia) Local version - append to kernel release
</pre>}}

Now make sure the nouveau driver is disabled or built as a module:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            <M> Nouveau (nVidia) cards
</pre>}}
Now recompile and install the kernel. Make sure you update GRUB to take the new kernel into account. Note that kernels with the same version but with different names are considered unique. So if you want to emerge an out-of-tree kernel module to be used with the nouveau kernel you'll first need to copy over the nouveau kernels config file to {{Path|/usr/src/linux/.config}}.

Blacklist the '''nvidia''' and '''nouveau''' modules as you don't want [[udev]] to try and autoload them.
{{RootCmd|echo -e "blacklist nouveau\nblacklist nvidia" >> /etc/modprobe/nvidia-n-nouveau.conf}}
And finally use the [[local.d]] script below to switch graphics driver depending on what kernel you booted with:
{{File|/etc/local.d/nvidia.start||<pre>
#!/bin/bash

depend() {
	need localmount
	before xdm
}

if [[ $(uname -r) == *-nvidia ]] ; then
	modprobe -q nvidia
	if [[ $(eselect opengl show) != nvidia ]] ; then
		eselect opengl set nvidia &>/dev/null
	fi
cat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-nvidia.conf << EOF
Section "Device"
  Identifier   "Device0"
  Driver       "nvidia"
  Option       "NoLogo" "True"
EndSection
EOF
else
	modprobe -q nouveau
	if [ -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-nvidia.conf ] ; then
		rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-nvidia.conf
	fi
	if [[ $(eselect opengl show) != xorg-x11 ]] ; then
		eselect opengl set xorg-x11 &>/dev/null
	fi
fi
</pre>}}
Copy it to {{Path|/etc/local.d/nvidia.start}} and set the executable bit:
{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/local.d/nvidia.start}}

== Switching using a single kernel and hprofile ==
Another method is switching between two profiles with [[hprofile]], using a single kernel: {{Path|/etc/init.d/hprofile}} has to be modified adding a few lines for vga switching. Warning: hprofile shall be added in boot runlevel.
