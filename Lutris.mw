Lutris is an open source gaming platform for GNU/Linux. It makes gaming on Linux easier by managing, installing and providing optimal settings for games.

Lutris does not sell games; you have to provide your own copy of the games unless they are open source or freeware. Games can be installed anywhere on your system; Lutris does not impose anything.
