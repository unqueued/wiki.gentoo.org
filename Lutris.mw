Lutris is an open source gaming platform for GNU/Linux. It makes gaming on Linux easier by managing, installing and providing optimal settings for games.

Lutris does not sell games; you have to provide your own copy of the games unless they are open source or freeware. Games can be installed anywhere on your system; Lutris does not impose anything.

== Installer scripts ==

Lutris automates installation of games using configuration scripts written in JSON or YAML, which list the various files needed to install a game and can perform a series of actions on them. The syntax of installers is described in [https://github.com/lutris/lutris/blob/master/docs/installers.rst docs/installers.rst on Github], and is also available on [https://lutris.net/ lutris.net] when writing installers.

A web UI is planned to ease the creation of these scripts.

== Game Library ==

You can optionally create an account on [https://lutris.net/ lutris.net] and connect this account to the client. This will allow you to sync your game library from the website to the client (not the other way around). If you wish, you can also sync your Steam library with your Lutris library on the website.

The client does not store your [https://lutris.net/ lutris.net] credentials on your computer. Instead, when you authenticate, the website will send a token which will be used to sync your library. This token is stored in {{path|~/.cache/lutris/auth-token}}.

== Configuration files ==
The client, runner, and game configuration files are stored in {{path|~/.config/lutris}}. There is no need to manually edit these files as everything should be done from the client.

<code>lutris.conf</code>: preferences for the client's UI

<code>system.yml</code>: default configuration for every game

<code>runners/*.yml</code>: runner-specific default configurations

<code>games/*.yml</code>: game-specific configurations

The game configuration can override previously defined runner and system configuration and runner configuration can override system configuration.
