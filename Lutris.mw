{{Warning|Gentoo requires additional dependancies for lutris games to work out of the box.}}

Lutris is an open source gaming platform for GNU/Linux. It makes gaming on Linux easier by managing, installing and providing optimal settings for games.

Lutris does not sell games; you have to provide your own copy of the games unless they are open source or freeware. Games can be installed anywhere on your system; Lutris does not impose anything.

== USE Flags ==
Following USE flags are supported on lutris:

{{USEflag|package=games-util/lutris}}

== Installation ==
{{important| It's recommended to use live version of games-util/lutris since stable/testing version in repo is outdated. Changelog here: https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases}}

Lutris is present in Gentoo repository as '''games-util/lutris'''. To install invoke following command:

{{RootCmd|emerge {{=}}games-utils{{/}}lutris-9999}}

== Runners ==

Lutris relies on various programs referenced as 'runners' to provide a vast library of games. These runners (with the exception of Steam and web browsers) are provided by Lutris, you don't need to install them with your package manager.

=== Following runners are supported in lutris: ===

* Linux (Native games)
* Steam
* Web
* Wine
* Wine + Steam
* Libretro
* DOSBox
* MAME
* MESS
* ScummVM
* ResidualVM

== Installer scripts ==

Lutris automates installation of games using configuration scripts written in JSON or YAML, which list the various files needed to install a game and can perform a series of actions on them. The syntax of installers is described in [https://github.com/lutris/lutris/blob/master/docs/installers.rst docs/installers.rst on Github], and is also available on [https://lutris.net/ lutris.net] when writing installers.

A web UI is planned to ease the creation of these scripts.

=== Writing a installer script ===

// I want to add this here

== Game Library ==

You can optionally create an account on [https://lutris.net/ lutris.net] and connect this account to the client. This will allow you to sync your game library from the website to the client (not the other way around). If you wish, you can also sync your Steam library with your Lutris library on the website.

The client does not store your [https://lutris.net/ lutris.net] credentials on your computer. Instead, when you authenticate, the website will send a token which will be used to sync your library. This token is stored in {{path|~/.cache/lutris/auth-token}}.

== Configuration files ==
The client, runner, and game configuration files are stored in {{path|~/.config/lutris}}. There is no need to manually edit these files as everything should be done from the client.

<code>lutris.conf</code>: preferences for the client's UI

<code>system.yml</code>: default configuration for every game

<code>runners/*.yml</code>: runner-specific default configurations

<code>games/*.yml</code>: game-specific configurations

The game configuration can override previously defined runner and system configuration and runner configuration can override system configuration.

== Runners and the game database ==

The data necessary to manage your library and run the game is stored in {{path|~/.local/share/lutris}}.

<code>pga.db</code>: your game library, game installation status, locations on the filesystem, and some additional metadata, all stored in an SQLite database

<code>runners/*</code>: runners downloaded from lutris.net

<code>icons/*.png</code> and <code>banners/*.jpg</code>: game images

== Command line options ==
The following command line arguments are available:

 --version             show program's version number and exit
 -h, --help            show this help message and exit
 -v, --verbose         Verbose output
 -d, --debug           Show debug messages
 -i INSTALLER_FILE, --install=INSTALLER_FILE
                       Install a game from a yml file
 -l, --list-games      List all games in database
 -o, --installed       Only list installed games
 -j, --json            Display the list of games in JSON format
 --list-steam-games    List available Steam games
 --list-steam-folders  List all known Steam library folders
 --reinstall           Reinstall game

Additionally, you can pass a <code>lutris:</code> protocol link followed by a game identifier on the command line such as:

 lutris lutris:quake

This will install the game if not already installed or launch the game otherwise (unless the <code>--reinstall</code> flag is passed).

== DXVK on lutris ==

From source: https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/How-to:-DXVK

== Planned Features ==
Here's what to expect from the future versions of Lutris:

* Integration with GOG and Humble Bundle
* Integration with the TOSEC database
* Management of Personal Game Archives (let you store your games files on private storage, allowing you to reinstall them on all your devices)
* Game saves sync
* Community features (friends list, chat, multiplayer game scheduling)
* Controller configuration GUI (with xboxdrv support)

== Where to look for a help ==

* '''IRC:''' #lutris, #gentoo-wine
* '''Discord:''' [https://discordapp.com/invite/gentoo Gentoo-discord], [https://tuxdb.com/lgg Linux_Gamers_Group], [https://discord.gg/linuxgaming Linux_Gaming]
* '''Forum:''' https://forums.lutris.net/

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Cannot find winemenubuilder.exe ===

winemenubuilder.exe is used in wine to make linux menu shortcut from windows. 

 wine: cannot find L"C:\\windows\\system32\\winemenubuilder.exe"

This should be ignored, because lutris is going to make it's own shortcuts at the end of each installation4.

If you wish to remove this error message from wine console: 

 Open Lutris > Lutris > Manage runners > Wine > Configure > DLL overrrides > Key == <code>winemenubuilder.exe</code> 
 > Value == <code>d</code>.

You can set Value on <code>b</code> if you wish to enable winemenubuilder.exe '''WHICH IS NOT RECOMMENDED'''.

=== Missing dependencies ===
{{stub}}

If you're missing a dependency one effective way is to use pfl's '''e-file''' command which is going to search gentoo repo for a missing file and outputs a package which contains that file.

Install pfl:
{{emerge|pfl}}

Look for a file in gentoo repo:
{{Cmd|e-file <file>}}

Where <file> is full name of a file you are looking for (supports wild cards).

==== lutris libraries ====

If <code>Lutris/GAME/Configure/System options/Disable Lutris Runtime</code> is disabled then lutris is going to use system libraries.

Lutris manages libraries via <code>~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/lib*</code>.
