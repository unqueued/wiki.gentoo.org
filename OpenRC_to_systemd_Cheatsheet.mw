This page is for users that recently converted from OpenRC to systemd. It contains a list of commands commonly used in OpenRC and its equivalent systemd command.

This is not an exhaustive list, and obviously not intended to replace reading manpages.

(*) - systemd automatically produces volatile services triggered by discovered hardware (consoles, serial ports, storage, networking, mount points, etc) which serve as dependencies to other services. They cannot be disabled in typical way, as they lack on-disk service definition, therefore masking is a way to prevent them from being initialized upon startup.
