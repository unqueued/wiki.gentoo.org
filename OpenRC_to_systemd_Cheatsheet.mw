This article is for users that have recently converted from OpenRC to systemd. It contains a list of commands commonly used in OpenRC and its equivalent systemd command.

{{Note|The following table is not an exhaustive list and is not intended to replace reading man pages.}}

{| class="table"
|-
! Command !! OpenRC !! systemd !! Comments
|-
| Start a service || <tt>/etc/init.d/<service> start</tt> '''or''' <tt>rc-service <service> start</tt> || <tt>systemctl start <service></tt>
|-
| Stop a service || <tt>/etc/init.d/<service> stop</tt> '''or''' <tt>rc-service <service> stop</tt> || <tt>systemctl stop <service></tt>
|-
| Restart a service || <tt>/etc/init.d/<service> restart</tt> '''or''' <tt>rc-service <service> restart</tt> || <tt>systemctl restart <service></tt>
