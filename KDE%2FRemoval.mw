This article describes the removal and clean up of [[KDE]].

It is recommended to begin with a clean environment in order to minimize issues, especially when considering one of the following actions:
* Downgrading KDE (eg. from snapshots/live ebuilds to the Portage version)
* Fully upgrading from KDE 3 to KDE 4
* Moving from an old [[overlay]] to a different one or the official packages

== Uninstalling and removing KDE ==

=== Uninstall all packages remotely depending on KDE ===

A possible way to completely remove an old KDE installation is by explicitly uninstalling all kde-base packages and software depending on {{Package|kde-base/kdelibs}}:

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|kde-base/kdelibs $(qlist -IC 'kde-base/*') $(for name in $(qlist -IC {{!}} grep -v '^kde-base/') ; do ( qdepends -C $name {{!}} grep -q kdelibs ) && echo $name ; done)}}

Note that this will not just remove KDE but also all other packages depending on it (unconditionally or through a USE flag dependency), such as e.g. libreoffice[kde].

=== Uninstall KDE packages provided by the KDE overlay ===

Removing KDE is also possible through sets (as provided by the [[KDE/Overlay|kde overlay]]):

{{Emerge|params+=-C|@kde-4.X @kdebase-4.X @kde-3.5}}

=== Deselecting overlays ===

If any old overlays are still defined, deselect them so that there are no conflicts with the KDE ebuilds.

=== Clean up portage definitions ===

Look in {{Path|/etc/portage}} for any KDE specific settings in {{Path|package.mask}}, {{Path|package.unmask}}, {{Path|package.keywords}} and {{Path|package.accept_keywords}}. Clean up those definitions pertaining to KDE packages.

=== Remove unneeded dependencies ===

After uninstalling KDE packages, ask Portage to uninstall any now unneeded dependencies:

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|&nbsp;}}

== Clean up KDE remains ==

If the system uses the ''desktop/kde'' [[profile]], change to the ''desktop'' profile. Also check in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} and other configurations files what the active USE flags are.

Remove the remaining KDE configuration files and app data in the following folders:
* {{Path|~/.kde}} - Configuration files and app data of KDE 3
* {{Path|~/.kde4}} - Configuration files and app data of KDE 4
* {{Path|/usr/kde/}} - App data of KDE 3
* {{Path|/var/lib/kde}} - Configuration files of KDE 4
* {{Path|/var/lib/kdm}} - Configuration files of KDM
* {{Path|/var/log/kdm.log}} - KDM log file

The following folders are shared folders. Only remove the KDE related files:
* {{Path|~/.config}} - Configuration files of KDE apps
* {{Path|~/.local}} - App data of KDE apps
* {{Path|/etc/conf.d/xdm}} - XDM configuration file
