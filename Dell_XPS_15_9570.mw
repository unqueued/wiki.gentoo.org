The MacBook Pro killer. Amazing performance for half the cost. But requires some configurations to make it amazing.

== History ==
The Dell XPS 15 9570 is the updated version of the 9560 models. Released in May 2018, this new model supports several choices in hardware configurations. Namely,
* The CPU can be one of the new Coffee Lake quad-core Core i5, hexa-core Core i7, or Core i9 processors. 
* The graphics subsystem can consist of solely an Intel Integrated GPU or both an Intel Integrated GPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti GPU.
* An optional fingerprint scanner integrated into the power button. 
* There is a choice of touch FHD (1920x1080 @ 60.00 Hz), non-touch FHD (1920x1080 @ 60.00 Hz), touch UHD (3840x2160 @ 60.00 Hz), or non-touch UHD (3840x2160 @ 60.00 Hz) for the screen.
* The choice of a 2.5 SATA SSD or M.@ PCIe NVME SSD.
Additionally, the 9570's Thunderbolt 3 port now supports all four PCIe lanes, unlike the previous models, which only had support for two lanes.

Remove the Killer Wireless-AC 1535 card and replace it with the Intel Wireless-AC 9260. The Intel card is vastly superior to the Killer card in every way [//www.snbforums.com/threads/review-of-intel-wireless-ac-9260-9560.44622/].

The Intel Wireless-AC 9260 can be purchased [//www.amazon.com/Intel-Wireless-Ac-9260-2230-Gigabit/dp/B079QJQF4Y/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=intel+wireless+ac+9260&qid=1553136796&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&rnid=2470954011&rps=1&s=gateway&sr=8-2 on Amazon.] 

A tutorial on replacing the wifi card can be found [//www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAKpjfc2hs8 here.]

==== Heat and CPU Throttling ====
The 9570 has a serious issue with dissipating heat which sometimes leads to throttling [//www.notebookcheck.net/Some-Dell-XPS-15-9570-laptops-may-have-a-BIOS-related-GPU-bug.355026.0.html][//www.dell.com/community/XPS/Dell-XPS-15-9570-i9-thermals-throttling-and-solutions/td-p/6116619][//www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/98cyam/power_limit_throttling_xps_15_9570/].

In most cases, this can be solved by updating your BIOS with the latest images from [//www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/xps-15-9570-laptop/drivers Dell's 9570 support page]. However, if the issue still persists, following [//www.ultrabookreview.com/14875-fix-throttling-xps-15/ this tutorial] may produce better results.
