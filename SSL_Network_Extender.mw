Checkpoint Solutions' proprietary VPN Firewall solution is called SSL Network Extender.  This article documents the manual setup required to properly tunnel into this firewall from a Gentoo Linux host.

To access the VPN from a Linux host, a user logs into a web site using Firefox, then launches a Java applet, which runs a pre-installed local binary (snx) which initiates and configures the tunnel.

<h3>Download the client install script</h3>

The client software is only available for download from the firewall appliance itself.  The VPN administrator must provide a URL (something like https://vpn.example.com/Login/Login) and credentials.

Log in and click the Settings link.
