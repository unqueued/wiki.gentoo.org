In Gentoo, font installation is handled much like other distributions. It can be as easy as copying the font file into the proper directory. Other methods, such as {{c|[[fontconfig]]}}, are also possible.

== Home directory ==

When installing fonts on a local basis, each user can create a {{Path|.font}} directory in their home directory. This directory can then be filled with font files:

{{Cmd
|mkdir ~/.fonts
|cp ~/Downloads/Inconsolata.otf ~/.fonts
}}

Check in a few applications to see if the newly copied font has been made available. A [[Terminal emulator|terminal emulator]] or an office program should work nicely for this purpose.

== Globally available ==

System administrators (those with root privileges) can copy fonts into the system's {{Path|/usr/share/fonts}} directory. This will make fonts available to any user on the system.

{{RootCmd|cp /home/larry/Downloads/Inconsolata.otf /usr/share/fonts}}
