In Gentoo, font installation is handled much like other distributions. It can be as easy as copying the font file into the proper directory. Other methods, such as {{c|[[fontconfig]]}}, are also possible.

== Home directory ==

When installing fonts on a local basis, each user can create a {{Path|.local/share/fonts}} directory in their home directory. This directory can then be filled with font files:

{{Cmd
|mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
|cp ~/Downloads/Inconsolata.otf ~/.local/share/fonts
}}

{{Note|Historically, the {{Path|~/.fonts}} directory was used to store fonts on a per-user basis. The modern equivalent is {{Path|~/.local/share/fonts}}.}}

Check in a few applications to see if the newly copied font has been made available. A [[Terminal emulator|terminal emulator]] or an office program should work nicely for this purpose.

== Globally available ==

System administrators (those with root privileges) can copy fonts into the system's {{Path|/usr/share/fonts}} directory. This will make fonts available to any user on the system.

{{RootCmd|cp /home/larry/Downloads/Inconsolata.otf /usr/share/fonts}}

== Console font ==

In order use a specific font in the console, set the <var>consolefont</var> variable in {{Path|[[:/etc/conf.d]]/consolefont}} to the name of a file found in {{Path|/usr/share/consolefonts/}} (without the {{Path|.psfu.gz}} suffix).

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/consolefont|title=Setting the console font|lang=bash|1=
consolefont="lat9w-16"
}}

Next, verify that the {{c|consolefont}} service is in the boot runlevel: 

{{RootCmd|rc-update -v show {{!}} grep consolefont}}

If no runlevel is displayed for {{c|consolefont}}, then add it to the proper level: 

{{RootCmd|rc-update add consolefont boot}}

== GUI font ==

To configure fonts for use in graphical applications, see [[Fontconfig]].
