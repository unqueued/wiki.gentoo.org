=Introduction=
When there are several VMs running and the developer wants them to interact with each other, you create a bridge. As discussed here you can easily bridge an Ethernet with the virtual machine(s). However, there are times when the developer is using a wireless network and still want to interact with the VMs. Also, another possibility is that the network on the ethernet is desired to have an independent state from the VMs and is not included in the bridge. This guide deals with such conditions.

=Prerequisites=
*{{Package|app-emulation/qemu}}  
*{{Package|net-dns/dnsmasq}}
*{{Package|sys-apps/usermode-utilities}}
*{{Package|net-misc/bridge-utils}}

Emerge the packages. Dnsmasq is not necessary but it can become very handy in case one does not want to setup the networking section of the guest and the host manually or the VMs depend on having a dhcp server running.
