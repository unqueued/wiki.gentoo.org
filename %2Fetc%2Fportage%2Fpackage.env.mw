{{Path|/etc/portage/env}} and {{Path|/etc/portage/package.env}} are used for modifying environmental variables, such as those in [[:/etc/portage/make.conf]], on a per-package basis.

* The {{Path|/etc/portage/env}} directory contains files that have the same syntax as {{Path|make.conf}}. The filename will be used as the key to override settings.
* The {{Path|/etc/portage/package.env}} file describes which of these files will be used on a per-package basis.

==Example 1: Enable debug information for a specific package==
Suppose you would like to build GIMP with debug information because you are using a development version and you would like to report any crashes.
Create a file in {{Path|/etc/portage/env}} that contains the desired changes:
{{Code|/etc/portage/env/debug.conf|<pre>
CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -ggdb"
CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -ggdb"
FEATURES="splitdebug"
</pre>}}

Next, add an entry to package.env followed by the name of the file you created:
{{Code|/etc/portage/package.env|<pre>
media-gfx/gimp  debug.conf
</pre>}}

==Example 2: Build certain packages in a different location==
Suppose your portage build directory is in [[tmpfs]], but some packages are too large, and run out of space. You can modify PORTAGE_TMPDIR for those packages.

Create an env file that modifies <tt>PORTAGE_TMPDIR</tt> and sets it to an on-disk directory:
{{Code|/etc/portage/env/no-tmpfs.conf|<pre>
PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/var/tmp/portage-ondisk"
</pre>}}

Add large packages to package.env:
{{Code|/etc/portage/package.env|<pre>
app-emulation/qemu-kvm  no-tmpfs.conf
app-office/libreoffice  no-tmpfs.conf debug.conf
www-client/firefox      no-tmpfs.conf
</pre>}}
Notice that it's possible to reference several env files for each package.

What 25 years of research reveal about the cognitive skills of happiness and finding lifes greater purpose.The illiterate of the 21st century, Alvin Toffler famously said, will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.
