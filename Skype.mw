'''Skype''' is a proprietary application owned by Microsoft for instant messaging, VoIP calls, and video conversations.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-im/skypeforlinux}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|net-im/skypeforlinux}}:

{{Emerge|net-im/skypeforlinux}}

=== Additional USE flags for {{Keyword|amd64}} ===

To emerge Skype on the {{Keyword|amd64}} architecture, the system cannot be on a nomultilib profile. The following settings will need to be in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/skypeforlinux}} or some equivalent.

{{RootCmd|echo  "{{=}}net-im/skypeforlinux-8.15.0.4 ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/skypeforlinux}}

Edit your pinentry usage in this way.

{{RootCmd|echo ">{{=}}app-crypt/pinentry-1.0.0-r2 gnome-keyring" >> /etc/portage/package.use/pinentry}}

and then just install the package.
{{RootCmd|emerge skypeforlinux}}

== Configuration ==

=== Using apulse ===

To avoid installing PulseAudio, users can install {{Package|media-sound/apulse}} instead to emulate PulseAudio enough for Skype to work by adding <code>net-im/skype apulse -pulseaudio</code> to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} or an equivalent before merging.

After merging Skype with the <code>apulse</code> flag, be sure to alias it:

{{Cmd|alias skype{{=}}'apulse skype'}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Auto-launching at KDE login ===

For some reason, [[KDE]] cannot remember Skype in the session it saves upon log out. This workaround will fool it into saving Skype in the session.

{{FileBox|filename=~/.kde4/Autostart/skype.sh|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
skype
}}

To make the Skype main window (but not chat windows) go to a desktop or any other features of Window Rules with KDE, use this regular expression under Window Title in the settings window:

{{CodeBox|1=
(^[A-Za-z0-9]+\s\-\s)?Skypeâ„¢(\s\d+\.\d+)?\s\(Beta\)(\sfor\sLinux)?$
}}

=== No video (despite video drivers being installed/loaded) ===

==== Permissions ====

It is possible, that your user does not have privileges to access video device. Example privileges:

{{Cmd|ls -al /dev/video0|output=<pre>
crw-rw----+ 1 root video 81, 0 Nov 25 22:03 /dev/video0
</pre>}}

Add each Skype user to the video group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a larry video}}

Where <code>larry</code> is substituted for the appropriate username.

==== Preload v4l1 ====

For 64-bit environments:

{{Cmd|LD_PRELOAD{{=}}/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype}}
