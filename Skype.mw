'''Skype''' is a proprietary application owned by Microsoft for instant messaging, VoIP calls, and video conversations.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-im/skype
|apulse++no+Use media-sound/apulse for PulseAudio emulation
|pax_kernel++no
|pulseaudio+yes+yes+Adds support for PulseAudio sound server. ''Unless using [[#apulse|apulse]], this is required for audio to work in voice or video calls.''
|selinux++no
}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|net-im/skype}}:

{{Emerge|net-im/skype}}

== Configuration ==

=== Using apulse ===

To avoid installing pulseaudio, install {{Package|media-sound/apulse}} instead which will emulate pulseaudio enough for Skype to work. To emerge apulse on the {{Keyword|amd64}} architecture switch to a [[Multilib/gx86-multilib|multilib]] profile. apulse needs a multilib version of ALSA and can not be installed simultaneously with {{Path|app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-soundlibs}}.

Alias {{c|skype}} to {{c|apulse skype}} if apulse will be used:

{{Cmd|alias skype{{=}}'apulse skype'}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Auto-launching at KDE login ===

For some reason, [[KDE]] cannot remember Skype in the session it saves upon log out. This is my current workaround.

{{FileBox|filename=~/.kde4/Autostart/skype.sh|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
skype
}}

To make the Skype main window (but not chat windows) go to a desktop or any other features of Window Rules with KDE, use this regular expression under Window Title in the settings window:

{{CodeBox|1=
(^[A-Za-z0-9]+\s\-\s)?Skype™(\s\d+\.\d+)?\s\(Beta\)(\sfor\sLinux)?$
}}

=== No video (despite video drivers being installed/loaded) ===

==== Permissions ====

It is possible, that your user does not have privileges to access video device. Example privileges:

{{Cmd|ls -al /dev/video0|output=<pre>
crw-rw----+ 1 root video 81, 0 Nov 25 22:03 /dev/video0
</pre>}}

Add each Skype user to the video group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a larry video}}

Where <code>larry</code> is substituted for the appropriate username.

==== Preload v4l1 ====

For 64-bit environments:

{{Cmd|LD_PRELOAD{{=}}/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype}}
