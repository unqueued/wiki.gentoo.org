'''Skype''' is a proprietary application for making VoIP calls and instant messaging.

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|net-im/skype}}:
{{USEflag|package=net-im/skype
|pax_kernel++no
|pulseaudio+yes+yes+Adds support for PulseAudio sound server. ''Unless using [[#apulse|apulse]], this is required for audio to work in voice or video calls.''
|selinux++no
}}
{{Emerge|skype}}

==apulse==
If you want to avoid installing pulseaudio, you can instead install [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/media-sound/apulse apulse] which will emulate it enough for Skype to work. To emerge apulse on amd64 arch you will need to switch to [[Multilib/gx86-multilib|multilib]] because it needs multilib version of ALSA and can not be installed simultaneously with app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-soundlibs.

Alias <code>skype</code> to <code>apulse skype</code>.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Auto-launching at KDE login ===
For some reason, [[KDE]] cannot remember Skype in the session it saves upon log out. This is my current workaround.

{{File|~/.kde4/Autostart/skype.sh||<pre>
#!/bin/sh
skype
</pre>}}

To make the Skype main window (but not chat windows) go to a desktop or any other features of Window Rules with KDE, use this regular expression under Window Title in the settings window:
{{Code||<pre>
(^[A-Za-z0-9]+\s\-\s)?Skype™(\s\d+\.\d+)?\s\(Beta\)(\sfor\sLinux)?$
</pre>}}
