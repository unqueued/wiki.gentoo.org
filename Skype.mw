Skype is a proprietary application for making VoIP calls and instant messaging.

== Installation ==
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask net-im/skype}}

== Auto-launching at KDE login ==
For some reason, KDE cannot remember Skype in the session it saves upon log out. This is my current workaround. What does not yet work is to have Skype go to a desktop (even with Window-specific settings for Skype). Because of this, you will have to drag Skype to the desired desktop each time you log in.

{{File|~/.kde4/Autostart/skype.sh||<pre>
#!/bin/sh
skype
</pre>}}
