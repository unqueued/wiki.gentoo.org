'''Skype''' is a proprietary application owned by Microsoft for instant messaging, VoIP calls, and video conversations.

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|net-im/skype}}:
{{USEflag|package=net-im/skype
|apulse++no+Use media-sound/apulse for PulseAudio emulation
|pax_kernel++no
|pulseaudio+yes+yes+Adds support for PulseAudio sound server. ''Unless using [[#apulse|apulse]], this is required for audio to work in voice or video calls.''
|selinux++no
}}
{{Emerge|skype}}

==apulse==
If you want to avoid installing pulseaudio, you can instead install [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/media-sound/apulse apulse] which will emulate it enough for Skype to work. To emerge apulse on amd64 arch you will need to switch to [[Multilib/gx86-multilib|multilib]] because it needs multilib version of ALSA and can not be installed simultaneously with app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-soundlibs.

Alias <code>skype</code> to <code>apulse skype</code>.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Auto-launching at KDE login ===
For some reason, [[KDE]] cannot remember Skype in the session it saves upon log out. This is my current workaround.

{{FileBox|filename=~/.kde4/Autostart/skype.sh|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
skype
}}

To make the Skype main window (but not chat windows) go to a desktop or any other features of Window Rules with KDE, use this regular expression under Window Title in the settings window:
{{CodeBox|1=
(^[A-Za-z0-9]+\s\-\s)?Skype™(\s\d+\.\d+)?\s\(Beta\)(\sfor\sLinux)?$
}}

=== No video (despite video drivers being installed/loaded) ===
===== Permissions =====
It is possible, that your user does not have privileges to access video device. Example privileges:
<pre>
# ls -al /dev/video0 
crw-rw----+ 1 root video 81, 0 Nov 25 22:03 /dev/video0
</pre>

You have to add your user to group video:
<pre>
gpasswd -a username video
</pre>

===== Preload v4l1 =====
If you have a 64bit
<pre>
$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype
</pre>
