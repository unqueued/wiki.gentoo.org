Skype is a proprietary application for making VoIP calls and instant messaging.

== Installation ==
{{Emerge|net-im/skype}}

== Auto-launching at KDE login ==
For some reason, KDE cannot remember Skype in the session it saves upon log out. This is my current workaround.

{{File|~/.kde4/Autostart/skype.sh||<pre>
#!/bin/sh
skype
</pre>}}

To make the Skype main window (but not chat windows) go to a desktop or any other features of Window Rules with KDE, use this regular expression under Window Title in the settings window:

<pre>(^[A-Za-z0-9]+\s\-\s)?Skypeâ„¢(\s\d+\.\d+)?\s\(Beta\)(\sfor\sLinux)?$</pre>
