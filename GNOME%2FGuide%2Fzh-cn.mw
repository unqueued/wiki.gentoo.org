一个经常使用的环境是GNOME。本指南试图描述GNOME的所有方面,包括安装、配置、使用、和更多!

== 什么是 GNOME? ==

=== 项目 ===

 [http://www.gnome.org GNOME project] 是一个免费的软件项目，它致力于GNOME的发展,Unix / Linux桌面套件和开发平台。 [http://foundation.gnome.org GNOME Foundation] 协调发展和GNOME项目的其他方面。 

=== The software ===

GNOME is a desktop environment and a development platform. This piece of free software is the desktop of choice for several industry leaders. It is interesting both for business users, home users, and developers. 

=== The community ===

Like with any big free software project, GNOME has an extensive user and development base. [http://planet.gnome.org GnomePlanet] is a popular blog aggregator for GNOME hackers and contributors whereas [http://developer.gnome.org Developer.Gnome.Org] is for the GNOME developers. [http://library.gnome.org/users/ GNOME Library] contains a huge list of GNOME resources for end users. The [http://worldofgnome.org/ World of GNOME] is also a popular aggregator for GNOME-related news.

== Installing GNOME ==

=== What is needed? ===

{{Important|First read and follow the instructions in the [[Xorg/Guide|Xorg guide]] to setup a X environment.}}

Before installing GNOME, editing the system's USE variables is a good idea. Make sure that <code>X</code>, <code>gtk</code>, and <code>gnome</code> are in the USE variable located in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. If support for <code>dbus</code> add it to the USE flags ([[dbus]] is a system message bus Gnome uses extensively). If no KDE support is required, remove <code>qt4</code> and <code>kde</code> from USE. USE variables can be removed by adding a minus sign (<code>-</code>) in front of them. See the example below for the minus sign used properly.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Example USE flags for a GNOME desktop environment|lang=bash|1=
USE="-qt4 -kde X dbus gtk gnome"
}}

Adding the <code>branding</code> USE flag provides a lovely Gentoo-branded splash screen instead of the default GNOME splash screen:

{{RootCmd|echo "gnome-base/gnome-session branding" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{Note|When using the <code>desktop/gnome</code> profile, these USE flags will be set for you. It is possible to check the system profile by running <kbd>eselect profile list</kbd>. Modifications can be made by running {{c|eselect profile set <profile-name>}} as root. Be sure to replace "<profile-name>" with the number or name of the desired profile.}}

Once done, begin the GNOME installation by emerging GNOME: 

{{RootCmd|emerge gnome-base/gnome}}

For a ''minimal'' GNOME installation, {{c|emerge gnome-light}}. This option provides a lightweight GNOME installation without the additional tools that a full GNOME installation provides so you might need to install additional packages afterwards.

{{RootCmd|emerge gnome-base/gnome-light}}

{{Note|The {{Package|gnome-base/gnome-light}} package does not pull in {{Package|gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver}}, which is needed for locking the screen. Be aware the screen probably will not lock without it.}}

This will take a while, so you might want to start reading all those books your mother bought you but you never opened. Done? Great, now update environment variables: 

{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

Next the remaining services and user groups will be cleaned. 

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus start
|rc-update add dbus default}}

Verify the {{c|plugdev}} group exists. If it does, it is advisable to make each GNOME user member of that group, but step this is optional (the group is not common anymore). 

{{RootCmd|getent group plugdev|output=<pre>
plugdev:x:104:
</pre>}}

Substitute <code><username></code> in the next command with each GNOME user's user name:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> plugdev}}

=== First impressions ===

It is time to take a look at what was just built. Exit the root shell and log in as a regular user. The next step is to configure the session manager to run GNOME when the the {{c|startx}} command is invoked (see [[Xorg/Guide#Using_startx|using startx]] in the Xorg guide for more information).

{{Cmd|echo "exec gnome-session" > ~/.xinitrc}}

Starting with gnome-base/gnome-session-2.26.2, users will need to prepend the <code>XDG_MENU_PREFIX</code> variable to get the GNOME menus when using the {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} method to start the desktop. If {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} is not being used it will be handled automatically; no additional configuration is needed. 

{{Cmd|sed -i '1i\export XDG_MENU_PREFIX{{=}}gnome-' ~/.xinitrc}}

Now start the graphical environment by issuing {{c|startx}}: 

{{Cmd|startx}}

If all goes well GNOME should happily provide a greeting. Congratulations on setting up GNOME!

It is possible to configure GNOME further. Take a look at the articles listed in [[GNOME/Guide#See_also]] for additional customization information.
