== Debugging ==
If you find a bug and want to file a [http://bugs.winehq.org/ bug report] you'll probably be asked to try the latest version, which is masked, so you'll need to unmask it:
{{RootCmd|echo "app-emulation/wine" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}
Now when you update it you should make sure the '''custom-cflags''' USE flag is enabled, as debugging will be impossible without it.
