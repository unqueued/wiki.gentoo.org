'''Wine''' ('''W'''ine '''I'''s '''N'''ot an '''E'''mulator) is an application that allows Windows software to run on Linux. This article deals with installing, configuring, and maintaining a general purpose Wine environment on Gentoo.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

It is likely for many users to desire Wine to support as much media as possible, in these cases be sure to enable the related flags.

{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/wine}}

=== Emerge ===

Enable the USE flags of choice and {{c|emerge}} {{Package|app-emulation/wine}}:

{{Emerge|app-emulation/wine}}

To install the latest development version of Wine the package needs to be individually unmasked:

{{RootCmd|echo "app-emulation/wine" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}

The above command does not apply to systems that have {{Keyword|~amd64}} defined globally in the <var>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</var> variable located in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}

== Configuration ==

=== Disabling the Menubuilder ===

To prevent Wine from adding menu entries and desktop links, the following {{Path|.dll}} override can be used:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.bashrc|lang=bash|1=
# Prevent Wine from adding menu entries and desktop links.
export WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winemenubuilder.exe=d'
}}

Previously added entries can be deleted by removing the corresponding files from {{Path|~/.local/share/applications}}. See [http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#head-ddc6f242056eb1a4fe566c9434d15fd8b64606aa Wine FAQ] for examples.

=== Tools and interfaces ===

Tools such as graphical interfaces for Wine can be helpful for users who want an alternative to the command-line:

* {{Package|app-emulation/q4wine}} - Qt4 GUI configuration tool for Wine.
* {{Package|app-emulation/wine-doors}} - Wine-doors is a package manager for Wine.
* {{Package|app-emulation/winetricks}} - Easy way to install DLLs needed to work around problems in Wine.
* {{Package|app-emulation/playonlinux}} - Set of scripts to easily install and use Windows games and software.

=== Environment variables ===

The environment variables of the shell that <tt>wine</tt> is started from are made accessible to the Windows/DOS processes. Some very useful Wine-specific variables include, but are not limited to, <code>WINEPREFIX</code>, <code>WINEARCH</code>, and <code>WINEDEBUG</code>.

See the <kbd>man wine</kbd> and <kbd>man wineserver</kbd> manual entries for more detailed information concerning Wine's environment variables.

==== WINEPREFIX ====

To create a Wine prefix in a custom location without affecting the default:

{{Cmd|WINEPREFIX{{=}}~/wine_testi wineboot}}

The above would create the Windows installation in the home path of the user, under {{Path|~/wine_testi}}

{{Note|Once a prefix has been created, the 'bitness' (arch) can not be changed. As such, the <code>WINEARCH</code> is not required to be defined for every command, unlike the <code>WINEPREFIX</code> variable. When using a non-default prefix without exporting it, the prefix and path need to be defined for each command.}}

==== WINEARCH ====

To create a 32-bit installation instead of the default (when built) 64-bit:

{{Cmd|WINEARCH{{=}}win32 WINEPREFIX{{=}}~/wine_testi wineboot}}

The Wine executable used could be anything that runs Wine, such as <tt>winecfg</tt>, which often makes sense while creating a clean, new prefix.

==== WINEDEBUG ====

Essential in finding out why an application is misbehaving when the basic terminal output or messages boxes are not enough.  See [[#Debugging|Debugging]] for examples.

== Troubleshooting ==

When a user encounters a problem with an application, they should try the latest development version to see if the unwanted behavior still exists.  If Wine has been built with options such as <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code> or <code>--hash-style=both</code>, the Wine developers will likely be unable to help with the issue, and reports including output from such builds should not be reported to the [http://bugs.winehq.org/ Wine Bugzilla].

The <code>custom-cflags</code> USE flag should be enabled for debugging builds.

For more directions on reporting bugs, see [http://wiki.winehq.org/Bugs Bugzilla and Bugs] at wiki.winehq.
