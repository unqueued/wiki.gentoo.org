Wine('''W'''ine '''I'''s '''N'''ot an '''E'''mulator) is an application that allows Windows software to run on Linux. This article deals with installing, configuring and maintaining a general purpose Wine environment on Gentoo.

== Installation ==
Enable the USE flags of choice and emerge {{Package|app-emulation|wine}}:
{{Emerge|app-emulation/wine}}

=== Media ===
Generally want your Wine environment to support as much media as possible so the recommendation is to enable as many of the following USE flag.
{{USEflag
|fontconfig++yes+
|gecko+yes+yes+Add support for the Gecko engine when using iexplore
|gsm++yes+
|gstreamer++yes+
|jpeg++yes+
|lcms+++
|mp3++yes+
|png++yes+
|truetype+yes+yes+
}}

=== Audio Output ===
{{USEflag
|alsa++yes+
|esd+++
|nas+++
|pulseaudio+++See the [[Wine#Pulseaudio|Pulseaudio]] section.
|oss+yes+no+
}}

=== Input/Output ===
{{USEflag
|X+yes+yes+
|cups+++
|gphoto2+++
|hardened+++
|jack+++
|ldap+++
|mousewrap+++Applies the [http://tinyurl.com/d3qbtex mousewrap] patch.
|nls++yes+
|openal+++
|opencl+++Enable OpenCL support
|opengl+yes+yes+
|vl4+++
|xcomposite++yes+
|xinerama++yes+
}}

=== Networking ===
{{USEflag
|capi+++Enable ISDN support via CAPI
|dbus+++
|gnutls+++
|ncurses+++Enable curses support in wineconsole.
|samba+++Add support for NTLM auth[http://wiki.winehq.org/NtlmAuthSetupGuide][http://wiki.winehq.org/NtlmSigningAndSealing]
|ssl++yes+
}}

=== Miscellaneous ===
{{USEflag
|custom&#8209;cflags+++Bypass strip-flags, See [[#Debugging|Debugging]].
|perl+yes++Install helpers written in perl (winedump/winemaker)
|scanner+++
|test++no+
|threads+yes+yes+
|win32+yes+yes+Build a 32bit version of Wine (won't run Win64 binaries)
|win64+yes++Build a 64bit version of Wine (won't run Win32 binaries)
|xml++yes+
}}

It seems that an error will occur if USE="win64" is added. So USE="win64" is not recommended.

== Debugging ==
If you find a bug and want to file a [http://bugs.winehq.org/ bug report] you'll probably be asked to try the latest version, and if you are not running ''testing'', you'll need to un-keyword it:
{{RootCmd|echo "app-emulation/wine" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}
Now when you update it you should make sure the '''custom-cflags''' USE flag is enabled, as debugging will be impossible without it.
