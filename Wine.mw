'''Wine''' ('''W'''ine '''I'''s '''N'''ot an '''E'''mulator) is an application that allows Windows software to run on Linux. This article deals with installing, configuring and maintaining a general purpose Wine environment on Gentoo.

== Installation ==
Enable the USE flags of choice and emerge {{Package|app-emulation/wine}}:
{{Emerge|wine}}

=== Media ===
Generally want your Wine environment to support as much media as possible so the recommendation is to enable as many of the following USE flag.
{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/wine
|fontconfig++yes
|gecko+yes+yes
|gsm
|gstreamer++yes
|jpeg+yes+yes
|lcms+yes
|mp3+yes+yes
|png+yes+yes
|truetype+yes+yes
}}

=== Audio Output ===
{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/wine
|alsa+yes+yes
|oss+yes+no
}}

=== Input/Output ===
{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/wine
|X+yes+yes
|cups
|gphoto2
|hardened
|ldap
|nls+yes+yes
|openal
|opencl
|opengl+yes+yes
|v4l
|xcomposite+yes+yes
|xinerama+yes
|udisks+yes+yes
}}

=== Networking ===
{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/wine
|capi
|gnutls
|ncurses+yes++Enable curses support in wineconsole.
|samba
|ssl+yes
}}

=== Miscellaneous ===
{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/wine
|custom-cflags++no+Bypass strip-flags, See [[#Debugging|Debugging]].
|perl+yes
|scanner
|test++no
|threads+yes+yes
|win32+yes+yes+
|win64+yes
|xml+yes
}}

== Prevent wine from adding menu entries and desktop links ==
{{File|~/.bashrc||<pre>
# Prevent wine from adding menu entries and desktop links
export WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winemenubuilder.exe=d'
</pre>}}

To delete already added menu entries you have to delete the corresponding files from {{Path|~/.local/share/applications}}.

== Tools and Interfaces ==
Tools with mostly graphical interfaces to Wine, so users do not need to use the commandline.
* {{Package|app-emulation/q4wine}} - Qt4 GUI configuration tool for Wine
* {{Package|app-emulation/wine-doors}} - Wine-doors is a package manager for Wine
* {{Package|app-emulation/winetricks}} - Easy way to install DLLs needed to work around problems in Wine
* {{Package|app-emulation/playonlinux}} - Set of scripts to easily install and use Windows games and software

== Debugging ==
If you find a bug and want to file a [http://bugs.winehq.org/ bug report] you'll probably be asked to try the latest version, and if you are not running ''testing'', you'll need to un-keyword it:
{{RootCmd|echo "app-emulation/wine" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}
Now when you update it you should make sure the ''custom-cflags'' USE flag is enabled, as debugging will be impossible without it.
