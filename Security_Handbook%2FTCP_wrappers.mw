Control access to services.

This is a way of controlling access to services normally run by inetd (which Gentoo does not have), but it can also be used by xinetd and other services.

{{Note|The service should be executing tcpd in its server argument (in xinetd). See the chapter on xinetd for more information.}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/hosts.deny|1=
ALL:PARANOID
}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/hosts.allow|1=
ALL: LOCAL @wheel
time: LOCAL, .gentoo.org
}}

As you can see the format is very similar to the one in {{Path|/etc/security/access.conf}}. Tcpd supports a specific service; it does not overlap with {{Path|/etc/security/access.conf}}. These settings only apply to services using TCP wrappers.

It is also possible to execute commands when a service is accessed (this can be used when activating relaying for dial-in users) but it is not recommended, since people tend to create more problems than they are trying to solve. An example could be that you configure a script to send an e-mail every time someone hits the deny rule, but then an attacker could launch a DoS attack by keep hitting the deny rule. This will create a lot of I/O and e-mails so don't do it!. Read the {{c|man 5 hosts_access}} for more information.
