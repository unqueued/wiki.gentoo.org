This article should adress many things you should keep in mind to make other people's life easier, when filling a bug report. Always remember, that they care about your problems for free.
== General information ==
===  Creating a new bug ===
'''Search for duplicates.''' Maybe someone else reported your problem, too?

If there are no duplicates, create a new bug. 

You should always add information about your system configuration to the bug. To do so, create a new attachement and paste the content of
{{RootCmd|emerge --info|}}

=== Adding information to another bug ===
'''Always stay on topic.''' A bug tracker is used for technical reports and chitchat should be avoided. Keep them in the forums, irc or mailing-lists.

'''Only confirm the existance of a problem once.''' It does not help solving the problem, if you and another person report it twice. But if your and the confirmer's systems differ in a obviously way and that would be helpful to know, add this information.

'''Do not hijack other bugs.''' If your problem is not discussed on a bug, search for one related to your issue or create a new report.

'''No talk on tracker bugs.''' Those bugs are meta bugs. If you want to add useful information, add them to a related sub bug or create a new bug.

== Problems at build time == 
== Problems at run time ==
== Other bug reports ==
=== Package XY was released in new version ===
First: '''Calm down.'''

So called zero-day requests (that means the bug report happened not later than 24 hours of the release announcement) should be avoided.
=== Package XY should be marked stable ===
* Did you test the version you want to become stable thoroughly?
* Are there other bug reports regarding this bug?
* Was the version of the package added to the tree since at least 30 days?
* Are its dependencies all marked stable?
