== Tips ==
Here a few tricks which could be used by Gentoo developers and other procmail users to clean up / sort excessive mail.

Please note that in order for any of the listed tips to work, procmail has to be enabled first. On dev.gentoo.org, this is done through setting the ''~/.forward'' file:

{{File|~/.forward|Enabling procmail|<pre>
| /usr/bin/procmail
</pre>}}

=== Removing duplicate (CC) mails from mailing lists ===
The mailing list etiquette requires people to CC all the people involved in a particular thread in replies to the mailing list, in case any of them is not subscribed. For that reason, people being subscribed often receive double replies -- first directly from the person, then from the mailing list.

A solution for that is to discard the directly received mail which is addressed to the mailing list address as well:

{{File|~/.procmailrc|Filtering out direct mails addressed to various mailing lists|<pre>
:0: E
* ! ^List-Id:
* ^(To|CC):.*(gentoo-(core|dev|dev-announce)\@lists\.gentoo\.org|devel\@lists\.claws-mail\.org)
.maildir/.Trash/
</pre>}}

In this case, mails which were addressed to the particular mailing list but didn't come from the mailing list directly are moved directly to ''Trash'' folder. Alternatively, ''/dev/null'' can be used to discard them completely.

{{Note|The mailing list etiquette to CC all the people involved does not apply on some mailing lists, especially those directed at users (eg. gentoo-user); CC-ing a person involved there is only to be done if that person has explicitly request you to. Filtering duplicates there is therefore unnecessary unless you request to be CC-ed yourself; in that case, add it in the To|CC list above.}}

=== Watching commits to chosen packages ===
Often it is useful to watch the commits done to your packages and/or eclasses, or any other CVS location relevant to you. In order to achieve that, you can subscribe to the gentoo-commits [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml mailing list] and then set up procmail rules to filter out irrelevant paths:

{{File|~/.procmailrc|Filtering out gentoo-commits by paths|<pre>
:0: E
* ^List-Id:.*gentoo-commits\.gentoo\.org
* ! ^Subject:.*app-arch/(libzpaq|zpaq|zpaq-extras|zpipe)
* ! ^Subject:.*app-portage/(diffmask|flaggie)
* ! ^Subject:.*eclass/(bzr|cvs|darcs|distutils-r1).eclass
/dev/null
</pre>}}
