<!--T:1-->
This article contains various sections to help KDE users troubleshoot their systems.

== Open GUI programs as root == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
{{Warning|It could be a ''very'' bad idea to start GUI programs with root privileges. Only use {{c|kdesu}} when absolutely necessary!}}

<!--T:4-->
KDE Plasma, along with other desktop environments, include a special command in order to start graphical programs with root privileges. For Plasma the command is {{c|kdesu}}. It can be used in the following manner:

<!--T:5-->
{{Cmd|kdesu <program>}}

<!--T:6-->
Be sure to substitute <code><program></code> in the command above with the name of the program. A pop-up window should be displayed containing a text box for the root password. Enter the password and boom: happiness.

== Rebuilding the application database == <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
If the KMenu lacks any application or the whole application list, the KDE application database probably needs to be rebuilt. This is also a possible fix for any KMenu related issues, like missing icons.

<!--T:11-->
{{Cmd|kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental}}

== Akonadi complains about the MySQL config == <!--T:12-->

<!--T:13-->
Start by checking the permissions in {{Path|/usr/share/config}}. If they're 700, update them to 755 recursively.

<!--T:14-->
{{RootCmd
|chmod -R 755 /usr/share/config
}}

<!--T:15-->
If that doesn't solve the error, open the akonadi configuration and change the default MySQL config. If the tray is not running, start {{c|akonaditray}}, select "Akonadi Server Configuration", activate "Use internal MySQL server" and then press the test button. To use the MySQL server and not the embedded executable, make sure that MySQL is running.

== Unable to mount devices using KDE Plasma Device Notifier ==
If the error message "''You are not authorized to mount this device.''" is being displayed when trying to mount devices by clicking them in the KDE Plasma Device Notifier (USB-stick-like icon in the system tray), add the following file to your configurationː
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/10-udisks.rules|lang=c|1=
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
	if (action.id.indexOf("org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount") == 0 && subject.isInGroup("plugdev")) {
		return polkit.Result.YES;
	}
});
}}

This will allow all users who are members of the ''plugdev'' group to mount devices using the Device Notifier. 

Use the following command to add users to this groupː
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> plugdev}}

{{Note|A reboot may be required for the changes to take effect.}}

== SDDM display issues ==

Check that {{c|sddm}} is in the {{c|video}} group.

If VT7 starts but stays black, make sure ~/.bash_profile does not have any interactive components like keychain. Check ~/.xsession-errors for the prompt for input.

== Screen Tearing/Flicker when using Radeon graphics drivers ==

If there is severe flickering or "tearing" when using Radeon based graphics cards, it may be necessary to change the Compositor sync settings to something other than the default "Automatic":

System Settings --> Display Monitor --> Compositor --> VSync

== Delayed response of KMenu, krunner etc. ==

Remove <code>gles2</code> USE flag and rebuild affected packages, most importantly in <code>dev-qt/*</code>, {{Package|kde-frameworks/plasma}} and {{Package|kde-plasma/kwin}}.
