<!--T:1-->
This article contains various sections to help KDE users troubleshoot their systems.

== Rebuilding the application database == <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
If the KMenu lacks any application or the whole application list, the KDE application database probably needs to be rebuilt. This is also a possible fix for any KMenu related issues, like missing icons.

<!--T:11-->
{{Cmd|kbuildsycoca5 --noincremental}}

== Akonadi complains about the MySQL config == <!--T:12-->

<!--T:13-->
Start by checking the permissions in {{Path|/usr/share/config}}. If they're 700, update them to 755 recursively.

<!--T:14-->
{{RootCmd
|chmod -R 755 /usr/share/config
}}

<!--T:15-->
If that doesn't solve the error, open the akonadi configuration and change the default MySQL config. If the tray is not running, start {{c|akonaditray}}, select "Akonadi Server Configuration", activate "Use internal MySQL server" and then press the test button. To use the MySQL server and not the embedded executable, make sure that MySQL is running.

== Unable to mount devices using KDE Plasma Device Notifier == <!--T:47-->

<!--T:48-->
If the error message "''You are not authorized to mount this device.''" is being displayed when trying to mount devices by clicking on them in the KDE Plasma Device Notifier (USB-stick-like icon in the system tray), add the following file to the configuration:

<!--T:49-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/10-udisks.rules|lang=c|1=
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
	if (action.id.indexOf("org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount") == 0 && subject.isInGroup("plugdev")) {
		return polkit.Result.YES;
	}
});
}}

<!--T:50-->
This will allow all users who are members of the {{c|plugdev}} group to mount devices using the Device Notifier. 

<!--T:51-->
Use the following command to add users to this group:

<!--T:52-->
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <var>&lt;username&gt;</var> plugdev}}

<!--T:53-->
{{Note|A reboot may be required for the changes to take effect.}}

== Black screen after login == <!--T:54-->

<!--T:55-->
Make sure {{Path|~/.bash_profile}} does not have any interactive components like [[keychain]]. Check {{Path|~/.xsession-errors}} for the prompt for input.

== Screen Tearing/Flicker when using Radeon graphics drivers == <!--T:56-->

<!--T:57-->
If there is severe flickering or "tearing" when using Radeon based graphics cards, it may be necessary to change the Compositor sync settings to something other than the default "Automatic":

<!--T:58-->
{{CodeBox|title=Modifying Compositor sync settings|1=
System Settings --> Display Monitor --> Compositor --> VSync
}}

== Delayed response of KMenu, krunner etc. == <!--T:59-->

<!--T:60-->
Remove <code>gles2</code> USE flag and rebuild affected packages, most importantly the (installed) packages from the <code>dev-qt</code> category, as well as {{Package|kde-frameworks/plasma}} and {{Package|kde-plasma/kwin}}.

== Missing shutdown/reboot/suspend/hibernate buttons (with consolekit) == <!--T:61-->

<!--T:67-->
Ensure dbus is added to the default runlevel so that it is started before logging in with sddm:
{{RootCmd
|rc-update add dbus default
}}

<!--T:62-->
Make sure that {{Package|kde-plasma/powerdevil}} and {{Package|sys-power/upower}} are installed. Also check that the user is in the {{c|users}} group.

<!--T:63-->
If {{Package|x11-misc/sddm}} is used, run the following command and make sure it matches the output including <code>nox11</code>:

<!--T:64-->
{{Cmd
|grep pam_ck_connector /etc/pam.d/system-login|output=<pre>
session         optional        pam_ck_connector.so nox11
</pre>}}

<!--T:65-->
Another option is to create the following [[polkit]] rule for suspend (as per [https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=344456#c38 this comment from the KDE bugzilla]):

<!--T:66-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/10-suspend.rules|lang=javascript|1=
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.upower.suspend") {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});
}}

<!--T:68-->
If all else fails, try {{Package|x11-misc/lightdm}} instead.

== Recover KWallet passwords after failed migration ==

{{Note|This assumes {{Package|kde-apps/kwalletd}} and {{Package|kde-apps/kwalletmanager}} - both slot <code>4</code> - are still installed. If they had been removed already, those packages will need to be temporarily re-emerged. As those package versions have been removed from tree long ago, this will involve recovering the ebuilds from <code>git</code> or adding the <code>kde-sunset</code> ebuild repository.}}

On many systems, prior to the upgrade to KDE Frameworks <code>5.34.0</code> there had to be a second KWallet service present - {{Package|kde-apps/kwalletd}} served to provide the same password storage functions to kdelibs4-based applications, such as <code>kde-apps/kmail:4</code>. With the upgrade to <code>5.34.0</code>, this is obsolete as one single {{Package|kde-frameworks/kwallet}} can take over requests from these old applications.

If applications are asking for passwords again that KWallet should have stored already long ago, this indicates that automatic migration from {{Package|kde-apps/kwalletd}} to {{Package|kde-frameworks/kwallet}} has failed.

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/kwalletrc|title=Remove these lines to re-enable password migration|lang=bash|1=
[Migration]
alreadyMigrated=true
}}

After editing and saving this file, leaving the session and re-entering should trigger the migration assistant, visible through the usual KWallet password prompt.

Unfortunately in some configurations, automatic migration has never worked properly. For those cases, there is a manual workaround - temporarily remove the new KWallet version:

{{RootCmd|emerge -C kde-frameworks/kwallet}}

After leaving the session and re-entering, executing <code>kwalletmanager</code> (important: this is NOT the same as <code>kwalletmanager5</code>) via <code>krunner</code> will add a new system tray application <code>Wallet Manager</code> through which old KWallets can be manually exported into XML files via <code>File -> Export as XML</code>. Make sure to keep these files only for the length of this process.

{{RootCmd|emerge -1 kde-frameworks/kwallet && emerge kde-apps/kwalletmanager}}

After once again entering a new Plasma session, now the previously created XML files can be imported into the new KWallet by executing <code>kwalletmanager5</code>, raising it from system tray and navigating to <code>File -> Import XML</code>.

At this point, the temporary XML files should be deleted again (skip the trash), and legacy packages can be removed:

{{RootCmd|emerge -C kde-apps/kwalletmanager:4 kde-apps/kwalletd}}

== kde-*/* related blockers prevent upgrade of neglected system ==

Package removals are usually announced at least 30 days in advance and put into <code>package.mask</code> so affected users are notified of the fact, find an alternative for their needs and clean up their systems. Long periods of not updating a system, or usage of update scripts, or simply ignoring those Portage messages in plain sight will inevitably lead to blockers at some point going forward. For that purpose, the following unmerge command contains a list of last-rited packages in recent times.
