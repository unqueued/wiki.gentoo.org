== Get rid of the KResource Migration Tool popup ==
There have been reports that the KResource Migration Tool pops up on every login. There is no proper solution yet for this, but you can see a workaround in {{Bug|353200}}.

== Rebuilding the application database ==
If your KMenu lacks any application or the whole application list, you probably need to rebuild the KDE application database. It is also a possible fix for any KMenu related issues, like missing icons.
{{Cmd|kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental}}

== Akonadi complains about the MySQL config ==
Start by checking the permissions in {{Path|/usr/share/config}} and {{Path|/usr/share/kde4}}. If they're 700, you need to update them to 755 recursively.
{{RootCmd|chmod -R 755 /usr/share/config
|chmod -R 755 /usr/share/kde4}}
If that doesn't solve the error, you need to open the akonadi configuration and change the default MySQL config. If you don't have the tray running, start '''akonaditray''', select "Akonadi Server Configuration", activate "Use internal MySQL server" and then press the test button. If you want to use the MySQL server and not the embedded executable, you'll need to ensure that MySQL is running.

== KDM fails to start ==
Start by checking the permissions in {{Path|/usr/share/config}}. If they're ''700'', you need to update them to ''755''. Check previous section. If that doesn't solve the error, check the following notice in the kdm ebuild:
{{Code|KDM notice|
If when you restart xdm, kdm fails to start with a message like "gentoo kdm[2116]: X server startup timeout, terminating" in /var/log/messages, uncomment the ServerTimeout line in "grep kdmrc /var/db/pkg/kde-base/kdm-4.3.1/CONTENTS {{!}} cut -f2 -d " "" and be sure to increase the timeout - 60 should work
}}

Also be sure that the following services are started:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus status
|/etc/init.d/consolekit status}}
If not, enable them by replacing ''status'' with ''start'', and use the command '''rc-update add dbus default''' for every one of them to add them to default runlevel.

Finally, KDM could fail due to errors in [[xorg.conf]]. Take a look in your logs: {{Path|/var/log/Xorg.0.log}} and {{Path|/var/log/kdm.log}} and fix xorg.conf accordingly. For additional help you can find us in IRC (#gentoo-kde at Freenode).

== The battery applet or solid notifications don't show the relevant info ==
So that the battery applet or other solid notifications can show the relevant info, you need D-Bus and ConsoleKit running:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus status
|/etc/init.d/consolekit status}}
If not, enable them by replacing ''status'' with ''start'', and use the command '''rc-update add dbus default''' for every one of them to add them to default runlevel.

== Double-hibernate or crashes after hibernate ({{Bug|363363}}) ==
KDE 4.6 handles "sleep button" events on its own, and the system correctly hibernates. If you have manually set up any other programs to handle these events (e.g. acpid), please disable that, as you may otherwise get double hibernation and/or system instability.

== Shutdown, reboot, logout does not work ({{Bug|326393}}) ==
There is some strange interaction between the sound system and the logout mechanism going on. Open systemsettings, and disable the "logout sound". Afterwards, logging out will likely work.

== The desktop background covers all windows ({{Bug|365623}}) ==
In rare cases, after working with several screens the desktop settings are not cleaned up properly. The result is that the desktop background seems to cover all windows. More details plus some manual workarounds can be found in {{Bug|260360|site=kde}}.

== No login possible, hangs at splash screen (bug 365637) ==
If you have been playing with unstable GNOME stuff (naughty!) you may encounter a so-far unexplained incompatibility. Logging in to KDE fails as soon as {{Package|net-libs/glib-networking}} is installed. Unmerge that package and you should be fine.
