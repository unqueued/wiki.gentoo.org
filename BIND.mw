BIND, or the '''B'''erkeley '''I'''nternet '''N'''ame '''D'''aemon, is [[Article description::a popular free software DNS server]], and also one of the most frequently used name servers on the Internet.

With BIND, users are able to set up a name server for managing their own DNS records, for caching DNS, or acting as a slave DNS server. The software supports DNSSEC which provides cryptographic signatures on the DNS records as a means to natively authenticate the integrity and ownership of the records.

== Installation ==

BIND is offered through the {{Package|net-dns/bind}} package. As with most packages, it is good practice to check the USE flags before emerging. Since BIND is a popular name server software, it is also a popular target for hackers and malicious groups. Is wise to securely configure BIND, which includes building in support for only features that will be actually used. If a feature will not be used, reduce the surface area of security vulnerabilities by disabling it.

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-dns/bind}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|net-dns/bind}}

=== Additional software ===

==== Bind-tools ====

USE flags for bind-tools:

{{USEflag|package=net-dns/bind-tools}}

Install:

{{Emerge|net-dns/bind-tools}}

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

To have automatically start BIND at system boot: 

{{RootCmd|rc-update add named default}}

To start the service now:

{{RootCmd|rc-service named start}}

Most management of BIND is done through its {{c|rndc}} command, although the {{Path|/etc/init.d/named}} (OpenRC) init script can be passed the following arguments, in addition the typical start/stop/restart routines:

; <code>checkconfig</code> : Validates the configuration file {{Path|/etc/bind/named.conf}} for correct syntax.
; <code>checkzones</code> : Validates the zone files for correct syntax.
; <code>reload</code> : Reloads the zone files without restarting the named daemon itself.

For example:

{{RootCmd|rc-service named reload}}

=== Chroots ===

System that will be using BIND in a chrooted environment should set the <var>CHROOT</var> variable in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/named}} accordingly. Check the comments as well, as they provide information on automatically creating the chrooted environment using {{c|emerge --config}}.

=== Recipes ===

==== Easy caching DNS ====

{{RootCmd|echo 'dns_servers{{=}}"127.0.0.1"' >> /etc/conf.d/net}}

As root edit {{Path|/etc/bind/named.conf}} add an internet service provider's DNS where the x.x.x.x are.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/bind/named.conf|1=
	forwarders {
		x.x.x.x;	// Your ISP NS
		x.x.x.x;	// Your ISP NS
		4.2.2.1;		// Level3 Public DNS
		4.2.2.2;		// Level3 Public DNS
		8.8.4.4;		// Google Open DNS
		8.8.8.8;		// Google Open DNS
	};
}}

{{RootCmd|rc-service named restart}}
