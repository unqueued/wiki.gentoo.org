BIND, or the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon, is a popular free software DNS server, and also one of the most frequently used name servers on the Internet.

With BIND, users are able to set up a name server for managing their own DNS records, for caching DNS or acting as a slave DNS server. The software supports DNSSEC (which provides cryptographic signatures on the DNS records as a means to authenticate the integrity and ownership of the records) natively.

== Installation ==

BIND is offered through the {{Package|net-dns/bind}} package. Please check the USE flags before installing. As BIND is a popular name server software, it is also a popular target for hackers and malicious groups, so it is wise to securely configure BIND - which includes building in support for only those features you are planning to use.

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-dns/bind}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|net-dns/bind}}

add bind to the boot scripts to automatically start bind upon boot.

{{RootCmd|
rc-update add named default}}

If you are planning on using BIND in a chrooted environment, edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/named}} and set the <var>CHROOT</var> variable accordingly. Check the comments as well, as they provide information on automatically creating the chrooted environment using {{c|emerge --config}}.

== Configuration ==

Most management of BIND is done through its {{c|rndc}} command, although you can use the {{Path|/etc/init.d/named}} (OpenRC) init script as well. Next to the default start/stop/restart routines, it also offers the following functionality:

* '''checkconfig''' validates the configuration file {{Path|/etc/bind/named.conf}} for correct syntax.
* '''checkzones''' validates the zone files for correct syntax.
* '''reload''' reloads the zone files without restarting the named daemon itself.

=== Recipes ===

==== Easy Caching DNS ====

{{RootCmd|<nowiki>echo 'dns_servers="127.0.0.1"' >> /etc/conf.d/net</nowiki>}}

As root edit {{Path|/etc/bind/named.conf}} add your internet services DNS where the x.x.x.x are.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/bind/named.conf|1=
	forwarders {
		x.x.x.x;	// Your ISP NS
		x.x.x.x;	// Your ISP NS
		4.2.2.1;		// Level3 Public DNS
		4.2.2.2;		// Level3 Public DNS
		8.8.4.4;		// Google Open DNS
		8.8.8.8;		// Google Open DNS
	};
}}

{{RootCmd|rc-service named restart}}
