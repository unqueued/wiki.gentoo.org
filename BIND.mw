'''BIND, or the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon, is a popular free software DNS server, and also one of the most frequently used name servers on the Internet.'''

With BIND, users are able to set up a name server for managing their own DNS records, for caching DNS or acting as a slave DNS server. The software supports DNSSEC (which provides cryptographic signatures on the DNS records as a means to authenticate the integrity and ownership of the records) natively.

== Installing BIND ==
BIND is offered through the {{Package|net-dns/bind}} package. Please check the USE flags before installing. As BIND is a popular name server software, it is also a popular target for hackers and malicious groups, so it is wise to securely configure BIND - which includes building in support for only those features you are planning to use.

=== Use Flags ===

{{USEflag
|package=net-dns/bind
|berkdb
|dlz
|ipv6
|ldap
|multilib
|python
|ssl
|static-libs
|threads
|xml
|caps
|doc
|filter-aaaa
|geoip
|gost
|gssapi
|idn
|mysql
|odbc
|postgres
|rpz
|rrl
|sdb-ldap
|selinux
|urandom
}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|
net-dns/bind}}

add bind to the boot scripts to automatically start bind upon boot.

{{RootCmd|
rc-update add named default}}

If you are planning on using BIND in a chrooted environment, edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/named}} and set the CHROOT variable accordingly. Check the comments as well, as they provide information on automatically creating the chrooted environment using '''emerge --config'''.

== Managing BIND ==
Most management of BIND is done through its '''rndc''' command, although you can use the {{Path|/etc/init.d/named}} init script as well. Next to the default start/stop/restart routines, it also offers the following functionality:

* '''checkconfig''' validates the configuration file ({{Path|/etc/bind/named.conf}} for correct syntax
* '''checkzones''' validates the zone files for correct syntax
* '''reload''' reloads the zone files without restarting the named daemon itself

=== Bind-tools ===
==== Use flags ====

{{USEflag
|package=net-dns/bind-tools
|ipv6
|readline
|ssl
|xml
|doc
|gssapi
|idn
|urandom
}}

==== Emerge Bind-tools ====

{{emerge|
net-dns/bind-tools}}

== Recipes ==
=== Easy Caching DNS ===

{{RootCmd|<nowiki>echo "dns_servers="127.0.0.1" >> /etc/conf.d/net</nowiki>}}

As root edit /etc/bind/named.conf add your internet services dns where the x.x.x.x are.

{{File|/etc/bind/named.conf||<pre>
	forwarders {
		x.x.x.x;	// Your ISP NS
		x.x.x.x;	// Your ISP NS
		4.2.2.1;		// Level3 Public DNS
		4.2.2.2;		// Level3 Public DNS
		8.8.4.4;		// Google Open DNS
		8.8.8.8;		// Google Open DNS
	};
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|rc-service named restart}}

{{Cmd|dig google.com}}
