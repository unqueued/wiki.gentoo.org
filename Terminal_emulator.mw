A '''terminal emulator, terminal application, term,''' or '''tty''' emulates a video terminal within another display architecture (usually X). It starts up with the default commandline [[shell]] that is defined as login shell for that user. On Gentoo the default [[shell]] is [[bash]].

If an X environment has not been setup in Gentoo, the system will boot to the first tty interface. Under most circumstances it is possible to access different terminal interfaces by pressing the {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|F1}} through {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|F6}} keys on the keyboard.

If an X environment has been setup, there are more than a few terminal emulator options available for the user to choose between.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Display garbled after binary output ===

On occasion the text in the terminal emulator will become garbled. This generally happens if binary output is displayed to standard out. This can easily be fixed by typing the {{c|reset}} command.
