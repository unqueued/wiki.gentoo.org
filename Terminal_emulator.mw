A '''terminal emulator''' emulates a video terminal within another display architecture (usually X). It starts up with the default commandline [[shell]] that is defined as login shell for that user. On Gentoo the default [[shell]] is [[bash]].

Popular terminal emulators are:
* XTerm: as default which comes with X.org, it is still used a lot.
* [[rxvt-unicode]]: lighter in resource usage, fast and more feature-rich (tabs, transparency, Unicode, etc.).
* xfce4-terminal: default terminal emulator for xfce
* terminology: default terminal emulator for enlightenment
* Konsole: default terminal emulator for [[KDE]]
* GNOME Terminal: default terminal emulator for [[GNOME]]
