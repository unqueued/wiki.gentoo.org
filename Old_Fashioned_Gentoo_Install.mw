This document describes how to install Gentoo without the hand holding automation features that users have come to take for granted over the last 10 years.
== Overview ==


=== Synopsis ===

Its possible to start with the offical stage3 files. This has only been tested on an amd64/no-multilib install.


{{Warning|Still reading ... don't say you were never warned. The usual caveat applies, if it breaks, you can keep the pieces. You might even try a post in Unsupported Software on the Gentoo Forums.}}
As this document is aimed at users with at least one Gentoo install to their credit, it is not a keystroke by keystroke guide, unlike the Handbook. The handbook steps are not repeated here, there is just some general references to it f$



=== Overview ===

* follow the handbook to install cron, a logger and a bootloader of your choice
* Install a kernel
* configure grub
* review and edit configuaition settings

'''What You Get'''

A modern gentoo base system but without all the bells and whistles added in recent years. Olde Fashioned Gentooee is more about what you don't get. You dont get

* udev - you get a static dev
* systemd - why would you want it anyway
* pulseaudio - I've not known this to actually add anything
* hotplug support
* auto mounting of any sort - use mount by label
* auto module loading
* device detection in Xorg

Separate /usr should just work as there is no udev to require that /usr is mounted before udev starts. If udev starts on your box you have done someting wrong. Separate /usr is not tested as I'm using lvm on top of raid5, so while my /$
