{{Warning|This is unrelated to glibc. It turned out it's a combination of sys-fs/udev and =sys-fs/udev-init-scripts-33}} 

{{Note|This is a single report; so far nobody else has observed it.}}

The usual {{Package|sys-libs/glibc}} upgrade procedure is to update {{c|@world}}, then use {{Package|app-admin/restart-services}} to restart daemons with changed libraries (most after a glibc update) and then a reboot (does not have to follow immediately). Since my distfiles are on glusterfs, an umount/mount is needed after the glibc update to reload libraries.

{{RootCmd
|emerge -uDNva1 @world
|umount /usr/portage/distfiles
|mount /usr/portage/distfiles
|restart-services
}}

Prepare for the reboot, update kernel if necessary...

{{RootCmd|reboot}}

With glibc 2.28 this caused sshd crashes on several machines. Even the {{c|umount /usr/portage/distfiles}} command terminated my ssh connection. It's probably a good idea to have {{Package|app-admin/monit}} installed to automatically restart sshd after a crash.

Because of that, this procedure seems to work better for glibc 2.28:

{{RootCmd|emerge -uDNva1 @world --exclude sys-libs/glibc}}

Prepare everything for the reboot, including kernel update if necessary

{{RootCmd|emerge -av1 sys-libs/glibc|reboot}}

== It continues even after reboot ==

This has worked fine for some time, but a week after this happened again on multiple machines. Rebuilding/upgrading to glusterfs 6.0 didn't help either. It's not reproducible on all machines.

It can be triggered by:
{{RootCmd
|mount /usr/portage/distfiles
|emerge -ev1 sys-cluster/glusterfs
|restart-services
|umount /usr/portage/distfiles
}}
