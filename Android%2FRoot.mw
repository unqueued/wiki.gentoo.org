A majority of android devices are locked down and therefore cannot be updated with community-supported patches and upgrades. 
All major rooting apps are proprietary and therefore cannot be entirely trusted.

<blockquote>
[[User:Rage|rage]]: One thing has been troubling me about Android development.

[[User:Rage|rage]]: Installing a custom recovery or rom is possible using fastboot.
[[User:Rage|rage]]: However, there seems to be no open source application for gaining root
[[User:Rage|rage]]: access on a device. 

[https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4544860 0sm0sis]: As for rooting/bootloader unlocking using vulnerabilities, that's a whole other game.
You basically need an escalation vulnerability to get a root prompt and then, if possible, 
unlock the bootloader from there, and that's why they generally remain closed-source,
since they don't want to disclose their vulnerabilities and risk the OEM patching them before they can spread it.

[[User:Heroxbd|heroxbd]]: Yeah, that is an unfortunate status quo.

[[User:Rage|rage]]: Hmm, so I get what you're saying about the vulnerabilities, but using a proprietary utility to achieve root access, for the purpose of liberating my device from proprietary software seems a bit backwards to me.

[[User:Rage|rage]]: A big problem that I have is that the more popular devices usually have many utilities, while less popular ones don't have anything at all. If there were a framework that could fetch exploits for a given device then it would be trivial to add new devices to the tool.

[[User:Rage|rage]]: Maybe we could write one as part of our toolchain?

[[User:Heroxbd|heroxbd]]: That would be very useful. Please go ahead.
