A majority of android devices are locked down and therefore cannot be updated with community-supported patches and upgrades. 
All major rooting apps are proprietary and therefore cannot be entirely trusted.

== Introduction ==

<blockquote>
[[User:Rage|rage]]: One thing has been troubling me about Android development.

[[User:Rage|rage]]: Installing a custom recovery or rom is possible using fastboot.
[[User:Rage|rage]]: However, there seems to be no open source application for gaining root
[[User:Rage|rage]]: access on a device. 

[[User:Heroxbd|heroxbd]]: Yeah, that is an unfortunate status quo.

[[User:Rage|rage]]: Maybe we could write one as part of our toolchain?

[[User:Heroxbd|heroxbd]]: That would be very useful. Please go ahead.
