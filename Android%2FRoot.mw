rage: One thing has been troubling me about Android development.

rage: Installing a custom recovery or rom is possible using fastboot.
rage: However, there seems to be no open source application for gaining root
rage: access on a device.

rage: Maybe we could write one as part of our toolchain?

heroxbd: That would be very useful. Please go ahead.

A majority of android devices are locked down and therefore cannot be updated with community-supported patches and upgrades. All major rooting apps are proprietary and therefore cannot be entirely trusted.
