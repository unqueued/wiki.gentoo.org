This article explains how to install and configure lmctfy, Google's open-source container support.  This page is very much a WIP.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

A kernel that supports cgroups is required in order to make lmctfy work.  The following setup enables lmctfy on linux-3.10.7-gentoo-r1.

{{Kernel||<pre>
[*] General setup  --->
    [*] Control Group support  --->
         [ ] Example debug cgroup subsystem
         [*] Freezer cgroup subsystem
         [ ] Device controller for cgroups
         [*] Cpuset support
         [*]   Include legacy /proc/<pid>/cpuset file
         [*] Simple CPU accounting cgroup subsystem
         [*] Resource counters
         [*]   Memory Resource Controller for Control Groups
         [*]     Memory Resource Controller Swap Extension
         [*]       Memory Resource Controller Swap Extension enabled by default
         [*]     Memory Resource Controller Kernel Memory accounting
         [*]   HugeTLB Resource Controller for Control Groups
         [ ] Enable perf_event per-cpu per-container group (cgroup) monitoring 
         [*] Group CPU scheduler  --->
             [*] Group scheduling for SCHED_OTHER
             [*]   CPU bandwidth provisioning for FAIR_GROUP_SCHED
             [*] Group scheduling for SCHED_RR/FIFO
         [*] Block IO controller
         [ ]   Enable Block IO controller debugging     
</pre>}}

=== Userspace ===

The following code exists in the "palmer" overlay, availiable from layman:

{{Emerge|lmctfy}}

== Configuration ==

The following commands setup a simple lmctfy container limeted to 100MB of memory and then proceeds to start a process that attempts to allocate 200MB of memory, which should be killed.

{{RootCmd
|lmctfy init ""
|lmctfy create memory_only "memory:{limit:100000000}"
|lmctfy run memory_only "memtester 200M"}}
