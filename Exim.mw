'''Exim''' is a powerful [[:Category:Mail Transfer Agents|Mail Transfer Agent]] (MTA). It's the default MTA for Debian / Ubuntu.

== Pre-installation ==
As only one MTA can be installed at the same time on a system, you might be required to unmerge an installed MTA. The package manager will report a block when another MTA is still installed. You can resolve this block by manually unmerging the old mail server. For example you can remove {{Package|mail-mta/ssmtp}} (which might have been installed as the default when a program requested a mail server to be installed) with this command:
{{Emerge|params+=-C|ssmtp}}

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|mail-mta/exim}}:
{{Emerge|exim}}

== Testing Exim ==
For the lay person, email your self, and don't forget to check the spam box. (if your email were to happen to be bunnyfoofoo@gmail.com):
{{RootCmd|echo "test" {{!}} sendmail bunnyfoofoo@gmail.com}}
