시나몬은 그놈 2의 기존 인터페이스를 갖춘 최신 데스크톱 환경이며,  [[LXDE]] 또는 [[Xfce]] 사용자층에서 이 환경에 쉽게 적응할 수 있습니다. 시나몬은 매우 멋진 그래픽, 기능 특징을 갖추었습니다. 그놈 쉘에서 갈라져 나왔으며 [http://linuxmint.com/ 리눅스 민트]<sup style="color:#ff0077">en</sup>용으로 개발했고 {{Keyword|amd64}}와 {{Keyword|x86}} 아키텍처에서 사용할 수 있습니다.

== 설치 ==

== 선행 과정 ==

시나몬은 systemd 없이도 매우 잘 동작합니다. systemd 의존성 없이 설치하려면 <code>default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop</code>과 같이 {{c|eselect}} 명령을 통해 그놈이 빠진 프로파일로 전환하십시오. systemd와 함께 설치하려면 <code>default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome</code>과 같이 그놈을 활성화한 프로파일을 활용하십시오. 두 경우 아키텍처와 버전이 다를 수 있습니다.

존재하는 시스템 프로파일을 띄우려면:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|output=<pre>
[1] default/linux/amd64/13.0
[2] default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
[3] default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop
[4] default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
[5] default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd
etc.
</pre>}}

==== OpenRC ====

OpenRC를 사용할 경우 올바른 시스템 프로파일을 설정하십시오:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop}}

또한 상단에 표시한 프로파일에 따라 관련 프로파일 숫자를 사용할 수 있습니다:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set 3}}

Read up on the instructions available in the [[Gentoo_Without_systemd|Gentoo Without Systemd]] article.

==== Systemd ====

For Cinnamon with systemd support select the GNOME desktop profile ending in systemd:

{{RootCmd|eselect default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd}}

{{Note|시스템 아키텍처(<code>amd64</code>)와 버전(<code>13</code>)은 <code>/gnome/systemd</code> 부분의 유무 여부만큼 다를 수 있습니다.}}

==== Xorg ====

Of course for Cinnamon to work [[Xorg/Guide|Xorg must be installed and configured]]. Make sure an X server is set up before proceeding with this article. If needed, test Xorg as detailed in the [[Xorg/Guide#Using_startx|Using startx]] section of the Xorg Gentoo guide.

Cinnamon (and other applications) are internationalized, supporting a number of languages (Linguas). If this was not done during the initial Gentoo installation, add the appropriate language value to the <var>LINGUAS</var> variable in {{Path|make.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|title=Set make.conf for French language code|1=
LINGUAS="fr" # or en, de, it, es, etc.
}}

It is advised to install {{Package|x11-libs/gtk+extra}} and {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting}} as it makes the Cinnamon experience more complete.

{{Emerge|x11-libs/gtk+extra x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting}}

Two USE flags, <code>icu</code> and <code>pulseaudio</code>, are needed by Cinnamon's dependencies. If they are not set already, either allow {{c|emerge}} to create or update {{Path|package.use}} (or {{Path|package.use/cinnamon}}) itself, or set the USE flags manually.

{{Note|The compilation duration for {{Package|net-libs/webkit-gtk}} can be very long, especially on older hardware. Be patient, Cinnamon is worth it!}}

=== USE 플래그 ===

{{USEflag|package=gnome-extra/cinnamon|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|gnome-extra/cinnamon}}:
|networkmanager++yes
|nls+yes+yes
|python_targets_python2_7+yes+yes+Build with Python 2.7
|python_targets_python3_3+++Build with Python 3.3
|python_targets_python3_4+yes+yes+Build with Python 3.4
}}

Find more information on Python targets by visiting the Python project's [[Project:Python/PYTHON_TARGETS|PYTHON TARGETS]] article.

=== Emerge ===

Finally, after performing all the steps above, ask Portage to emerge Cinnamon:

{{Emerge|gnome-extra/cinnamon}}

== 시스템 설정 ==

Before looking at the Cinnamon theming, configure the system to properly start Cinnamon at boot or upon user request, and enable the right privilege delegation settings so that end users can interact with the system in an intuitive manner.

=== 서비스 ===

The next set of instructions show how to deal with OpenRC. With systemd use {{c|systemctl}} as detailed in the [[Systemd#Enabling.2C_disabling.2C_starting_and_stopping_services|systemd page]].

==== dbus와 consolekit ====

Xorg server and Cinnamon need the {{c|dbus}} and {{c|consolekit}} services, make sure that they will be started at system boot time:

{{RootCmd
|rc-update add dbus default
|rc-update add consolekit default
}}

Next, start the services (there is no need to restart the system):

{{RootCmd
|rc-service dbus start
|rc-service consolekit start
}}

==== NetworkManager ====

[[NetworkManager]] is a Cinnamon dependency and is not needed if the network was configured during the initial Gentoo installation. It should not run concurrently with another network service. If NetworkManager is desired be sure to disable other network management programs or services before starting it. For example, if the system was originally configured to use Gentoo's netifrc scripts to manage the network connections, disable these network services:

{{RootCmd
|rc-service net.eth0 stop
|rc-update del net.eth0 default
}}

{{Note|When using {{Package|sys-fs/udev}} network interfaces will be using [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/ Predictable Network Interface Names] to name the active interfaces. This will produce names like {{Path|enp12s0}}, {{Path|eno1}}, {{Path|enp2s0}}, etc. When using {{Package|sys-fs/eudev}}, the Gentoo udev fork avoiding systemd dependencies, the first network interface name is often still called {{Path|eth0}}.}}

After removing the other network services, add NetworkManager:

{{RootCmd
|rc-service NetworkManager start
|rc-update add NetworkManager default
}}

=== Sudo ===

For an ordinary user to reboot or shutdown the system from Cinnamon, {{c|sudo}} is needed with some settings.

First install {{Package|app-admin/sudo}}:

{{Emerge|app-admin/sudo}}

Next modify the {{c|sudo}} configuration with the {{c|visudo}} command:

{{RootCmd|visudo}}

Visudo runs the default text editor to generate or update a {{Path|sudoers}} file. Replace <code>username</code> in the text below with the username of each user that will be using Cinnamon:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sudoers|lang=bash|1=
username  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
username  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt
username  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff
username  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
}}

Or for the {{c|wheel}} group:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sudoers|lang=bash|1=
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
}}

=== Polkit 규칙 및 동작 ===

For an ordinary user to perform additional highly privileged actions from Cinnamon, policy kit must be configured. Use {{c|pkaction}} to get a list of actions; the names should be self-explanatory:

{{RootCmd|pkaction|output=<pre>
org.cinnamon.settings-daemon.plugins.power.backlight-helper
org.cinnamon.settings-users
org.cinnamon.settingsdaemon.datetimemechanism.configure
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Contacts
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Control
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Device.Control
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Firmware
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Location
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Messaging
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.USSD
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.enable-disable-network
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.enable-disable-wifi
etc.
</pre>}}

The simplest way is to authorize all actions by only testing {{c|wheel}} group membership. Put a JavaScript file with a {{Path|.rules}} extension in {{Path|/etc/polkit-1/rules.d}}, named for example {{Path|55-allowing-all-actions.rules}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/55-allowing-all-actions.rules|lang=javascript|title=Setting general polkit rule|1=
polkit.addRule (function (action, subject)
{
  if (subject.isInGroup ("wheel"))
  {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});
}}

To only authorize some actions, the action names must be iterated. For a {{c|wheel}} group user to suspend, hibernate, shutdown and restart the system, make a {{Path|55-allowing-actions.rules}} file like so:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/55-allowing-actions.rules|lang=javascript|title=Setting polkit rules|1=
polkit.addRule (function (action, subject)
{
  if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate" {{!}}{{!}}
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.upower.suspend" {{!}}{{!}}
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop" {{!}}{{!}}
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart" &&
      subject.isInGroup ("wheel"))
      {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
      }
});
}}
Various actions can be added: those to change color profiles, use Nemo (Cinnamon files manager) as root, mount and eject media, set screen backlight, use network manager, change wallpaper, etc. Several <code>polkit.addRule (function (action, subject){&nbsp;…&nbsp;});</code> blocks can be used next to each other as well, and several files can be added.

{{Important|{{Path|/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-default.rules}} already exists. Newly created file(s) names should begin with a number bigger than 50, '''55''' for example, so they are processed after the {{Path|50-default.rules}} file. Do not make a file which would be processed before it, for instance one beginning with '''45'''.
}}

=== 시나몬 시작 ===

When not using a login/display manager, make a {{Path|.xinitrc}} file in the user's home directory:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|title=시나몬 실행 명령|1=
exec cinnamon-session
}}

Then to start Xorg and Cinnamon, execute {{c|startx}} after logging in:

{{Cmd|startx}}

With a display manager follow the [[display manager]] instructions.

== 테마 설정 ==

=== Mint-X 아이콘 ===

By default Cinnamon comes with Gnome icons. [https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-x-icons Mint-X icons are on GitHub]. Download, unzip, and put the Mint-X icon set in {{Path|/usr/share/icons}}:

{{RootCmd|mv pathToUnzippedArchive/mint-x-icons-master/usr/share/icons/Mint-X /usr/share/icons/Mint-X}}

Next, make a cache for it:

{{RootCmd|gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/Mint-X}}

The new icon set can be selected in Cinnamon Control Center. Mint-X icons are green, but other icon sets with different colors can be installed too, like Mint-X-Grey or Mint-X-Orange. Make sure to create a cache for these as well.

{{Important|Always install the Mint-X icon set with at least one colored icon set as it relies on it.}}

=== 데스크톱 아이콘 텍스트 색상 ===

An icon's text color in Cinnamon desktop is black by default, which is not always readable. The instructions to change this color depends on the GTK+ 3 version that the system is using. Get the currently used version with:

{{Cmd|emerge --info x11-libs/gtk+}}

* In GTK+ versions less than 3.13.3, this setting can only be changed system-wide. Change the text color by adding CSS rules to the {{Path|/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-3.0/gtk.css}} file (Adwaita is the default theme coming with GTK+), after the <code>@import</code> line:

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-3.0/gtk.css|lang=css|title=CSS rules for GTK+ &lt; 3.13.3|1=
@import url("resource:///org/gnome/adwaita/gtk-main.css");
 
/* added css rules */
.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item {
  color: #fff;  /* #fff is white web color indication, #333 should be dark grey */
}
 
.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item:selected {
  background-color: alpha (#fff, 0.2);  /* 0.2 is transparency level */
}
}}

: The 2<sup>nd</sup> rule concerns the selected desktop icon and can be modified to get another background color or set the transparency.

* In more recent GTK+ versions (3.13.3 onward), this must be tuned through a user-specific configuration file. Adwaita is now included in GTK+ as the theme replacing Raleigh, so rules must be set in the user's home directories. The file to edit is {{Path|~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css}}, and the change is now without the <code>@import</code> line. Additionally in this example, the left Nemo side bar is gray colored:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css|lang=css|title=CSS rules for GTK+ &ge; 3.13.3|1=
.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item {
  color: #fff;
}
 
.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item:selected {
  background-color: alpha (#fff, 0.2);
}
 
NemoWindow .sidebar, NemoWindow .sidebar .view {
  background-color: #444;
  color: #eee; /* light grey */
}
}}

=== Mint-X 테마 ===

Cinnamon comes with a default cinnamon theme, obviously... The Mint-X themes are [https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-themes available for download] on GitHub. Download them, unzip, and copy to {{Path|/usr/share/themes}} if needed. They can be selected in the Cinnamon Control Center.

=== 테마 가지고 놀기 ===

Almost all theme settings can be changed in the {{Path|cinnamon.css}} file in the theme directory.

For example with the Cinnamon theme, which is not in {{Path|/usr/share/themes}} but in {{Path|/usr/share/cinnamon/theme}}, first copy the theme's directory to a user {{Path|.themes}} sub-directory, named for example {{Path|other-cinnamon}}, which will be the new theme name:

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /home/userName/.themes/other-cinnamon
|cp -R /usr/share/cinnamon/theme /home/userName/.themes/other-cinnamon/cinnamon
|chown -R userName:userName /home/userName/.themes/other-cinnamon
}}

Edit {{Path|~/.themes/other-cinnamon/cinnamon/cinnamon.css}}. The results of the changes can be viewed immediately by selecting another theme in Cinnamon Control Center, then reselecting the theme being changed.

== 문제 해결 ==

If problems occur, try to get access to the live error messages. These can be displayed on a separate (virtual) terminal or in a log file. If the messages cannot be found, try starting Cinnamon from the command line rather than through a display manager. Alternatively have a look at {{Path|/var/log/Xorg.0.log}}.

When the error or warning messages are not sufficient to troubleshoot Cinnamon, start it with the <code>--debug</code> parameter to get more detailed Xorg messages:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|title=Cinnamon debug launch|1=
exec cinnamon-session --debug
}}

If Cinnamon cannot launch, deleting (or renaming) {{Path|.cinnamon}} in the home directory is not enough: other Cinnamon or Gnome items must be deleted (or renamed) too before X restarts. These can be found in the {{Path|.cache}}, {{Path|.config}} and {{Path|.local}} XDG directories. {{Path|.gnome2}} can be deleted (or renamed) entirely.
