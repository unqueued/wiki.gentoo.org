|kernel live check|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Using [https://github.com/dynup/kpatch Kpatch] after adding it to the Gentoo repository, 
make a tool for receiving kernel security patches and automatically live update the kernel. 
The tool will be similar to GLSA_check, but specially made for the kernel with live patch feature.
Creating a server with security patches they will be delivered automatically for patching the kernel. 
Testing the live patches creating a live patch testing feature on the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Aliceinwire/Kernel_CI Gentoo Kernel CI] .
Implementing new feature in the Gentoo Kernel CI, creating the kernel_check ebuild and creating a more fast Gentoo Kernel source releasing schedule using CI tools would be part of this task.|
