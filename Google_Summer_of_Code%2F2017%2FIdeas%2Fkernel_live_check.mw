|kernel live check|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Currently there is no [https://github.com/dynup/kpatch Kpatch] package in Gentoo, as now Gentoo have no system for automatically live patching the kernel, in case there is a security issue. This can became a problem in environment where there is need of a tested and working security live patch and there is no possibility to restart the system. Your work will be to design and create a service for test and deploy security live patch that can be installed by a security script that will check the kernel for vulnerability, will suggest some patch (that will be managed by a Gentoo server and GPG signed) and after user confirm will proceed to automatically install.
The [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Aliceinwire/Kernel_CI Gentoo Kernel CI] is starting to automatize part of the Gentoo kernel releasing process, this is making more fast Gentoo Kernel release possible. Having a working Gentoo Kernel CI is critical for keep up with the new upstream Kernel release style, but probably more important would give the possibility of fast stabilizing a kernel, with adequate architecture disposable. The task would be to improve the current Gentoo Kernel CI and designing and creating new feature.|
