'''AutoFS''' uses the Linux kernel Automounter to automatically mount several types of media like memory sticks, network shares, CD-Rom/DVD/BR etc. on demand.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|<pre>
File systems --->
    <*> Kernel automounter version 4 support (also supports v3)
</pre>}}

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-fs/autofs}}

=== Emerge ===

Like most filesystems available for Linux, after AutoFS has been enabled in the kernel, the user space package must be installed for system administration:

{{Emerge|net-fs/autofs}}

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

Start and add AutoFS to the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd
|/etc/init.d/autofs start
|rc-update add autofs default
}}

=== Files ===

The configuration files are found in the following locations:
{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|-
! scope="col" width="25%" | File
! Description
|-
| {{Path|/etc/conf.d/autofs}} || this file can be used to add ''automount'' command line options than will be used when the daemon is started;
|-
| {{Path|/etc/autofs/autofs.conf}} || it defines some default parameters, such as the location of the master configuration file or default timeout that causes an inactive mount to be disconnected;
|-
| {{Path|/etc/autofs/auto.master}} || it's the ''"master map"'' which is consulted to set up managed mount points when the autofs script is invoked. It lists all the maps and their associated directories. It consists of triplets of directory name, map name, and mount options to be used with that map;
|-
| {{Path|/etc/autofs/auto.misc}} || it's the map file which specifies the resources and mount options for the ''misc'' mount point;
|}

== Usage ==

General configuration files for AutoFS. 

{{Important|You probably need to install additional software and modules to mount DVD, NFS, CIFS etc. The mount helpers need to be available for each file system you configure.}}

=== autofs configuration ===

The default options for autofs can be changed by setting the proper configuration variables located in {{Path|/etc/autofs/autofs.conf}}. The default location for the master map is ({{Path|/etc/autofs/auto.master}}). It can be changed by setting the <tt><b>master_map_name</b></tt> configuration variable in {{Path|/etc/autofs/autofs.conf}}.

{{Note|The following examples of configuration files take into account the default location for {{Path|auto.master}}.}}

=== auto.master ===

In this configuration file is defined what other configuration files should be included as root mount-point. Here is one example with one additional mount-point on {{Path|/mnt/auto}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/autofs/auto.master|lang=properties|1=
+auto.master # extry needed for NIS mapping
# Here are the files listed, that should be included
# mount-point {{!}} config file {{!}} options
/mnt/auto   /etc/autofs/auto.misc    <nowiki>--timeout=15 --ghost</nowiki>
}}

{{Note|{{Path|/mnt/auto}} is the root mount-point for all file systems defined in auto.misc. <code>--timeout</code> defines how many seconds to wait before the file system is unmounted. <code>--ghost</code> creates empty folders for each mount-point in auto.misc, this prevents timeouts if a network share cannot be contacted.}}

=== auto.misc ===

Here is our example for the file auto.misc. The folders for the mount-points are automatically created:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/autofs/auto.misc|lang=properties|1=
# mount-point below /mnt/auto {{!}} mount options {{!}} device, network share etc.

# CD-Rom on /mnt/auto/cd
cd              -fstype<nowiki>=</nowiki>iso9660,ro,nosuid,nodev              :/dev/cdrom
# nework share mounted via NFSv3 on /mnt/auto/data
data            -rw,vers<nowiki>=</nowiki>3,soft,async                        192.168.0.254:/tank1/data
# nework share mounted via CIFS on /mnt/auto/data1
data1           -fstype<nowiki>=</nowiki>cifs,credentials<nowiki>=</nowiki>/root/smb.txt       ://192.168.0.254/data1
# memory stick used regulary with known UUID, for example a kindle
kindle          -fstype<nowiki>=</nowiki>vfat,rw,uid<nowiki>=</nowiki>1000                     :UUID<nowiki>="4CBF-23A2"</nowiki>
}}

{{Note|There are several more examples in the auto.misc that comes with the package}}

=== Simple Windows-like SMB shares usage ===

If you want to use network SMB shares easily you can try the following configuration. You will be able to automount, for example, by issuing "cd /net/10.50.40.32/share" command in shell or "/net/10.50.40.32/share" in a browser or commander and work with the files inside as they were located on local machine. Make the following modifications:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/autofs/auto.master|lang=properties|1=
#+auto.master
/net file:/etc/autofs/auto.smbm --ghost --nonstrict
}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/autofs/auto.smbm|lang=properties|1=
* -fstype=autofs,-Dhost=& file://etc/autofs/auto.share
}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/autofs/auto.share|lang=properties|1=
* -fstype=cifs,username=guest,password=,file_mode=0664,dir_mode=0775,uid=netmount,gid=netmount,port=139 ://${host}/&
}}

Restart autofs daemon and you are ready to use simple automount.
