''AutoFS'' uses the Linux kernel Automounter to automatically mount several types of media like memory sticks, network shares, CD-Rom/DVD/BR etc.

== Installation ==
To enable the kernel based automounter:
{{Kernel||<pre>File systems --->
    <*> Kernel automounter version 4 support (also supports v3)</pre>}}
{{Package|net-fs/autofs}} is available on Gentoo Linux and supports the following useflags
* ''hesiod'' = Install hesiod module
* ''ldap'' = Install LDAP module
* ''sasl'' = Enable SASL support in the LDAP module
You can install AutoFS using the following command:
{{ShellRoot|emerge -av net-fs/autofs}}
Start and add AutoFS to the default runlevel:
{{ShellRoot|/etc/init.d/autofs start && rc-update add autofs default}}

The configuration files are located in
{{Code|Screen Configuration Files|<pre>
/etc/conf.d/autofs
/etc/autofs/auto.master
/etc/autofs/auto.misc</pre>}}

== Usage ==
General configuration files for AutoFS. 
{{Important|You probably need to install additional software and modules to mount DVD, NFS, CIFS etc. The mount helpers need to be available for each file system you configure.}}
=== auto.master ===
In this configuration file is defined what other configuration files should be included as root mount-point. Here is one example with one additional mount-point on /mnt/auto
{{Code|/atc/autofs/auto.master|<pre>
+auto.master # extry needed for NIS mapping
# Here are the files listed, that should be included
# mount-point | config file | options
/mnt/auto   /etc/autofs/auto.misc    --timeout=15 --ghost</pre>}}
{{Note|/mnt/auto is the root mount-point for all file systems defined in auto.misc. ''--timeout'' defines how many seconds to wait before the file system is unmounted. ''--ghost'' creates empty folders for each mount-point in auto.misc, this prevents timeouts if a network share cannot be contacted.}}

=== auto.misc ===
Here is our example for the file auto.misc. The folders for the mount-points are automatically created
{{Code|/etc/autofs/auto.misc|<pre>
# mount-point below /mnt/auto | mount options | device, network share etc.

# CD-Rom on /mnt/auto/cd
cd              -fstype=iso9660,ro,nosuid,nodev         :/dev/cdrom
# nework share mounted via NFSv3 on /mnt/auto/data
data            -rw,vers=3,soft,async                   192.168.0.254:/tank1/data
# nework share mounted via CIFS on /mnt/auto/data1
data1           -fstype=cifs,credentials=/root/smb.txt  ://192.168.0.254/data1</pre>}}
{{Note|There are several more examples in the auto.misc that comes with the package}}
