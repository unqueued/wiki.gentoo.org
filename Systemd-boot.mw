'''systemd-boot''', formerly called gummiboot, is [[Article description::a simple UEFI boot manager capable of booting Linux and Windows in EFI mode.]]

{{Note|As of systemd 220, systemd-boot has been included with [[systemd]] (accessible via the {{c|bootctl}} command). If {{Package|sys-apps/systemd}} has been installed on the system, then {{Package|sys-boot/systemd-boot}} does ''not'' need to be installed.}}

== Installation ==

The installation of systemd-boot consists of the following steps:

# Emerging the package (not necessary if {{Package|sys-apps/systemd}} has been emerged).
# Preparing the [[EFI System Partition]].
# Installing the systemd-boot UEFI boot manager.

=== Emerge ===

For the moment, systemd-boot is marked as unstable (~) so it must to be added to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}:

{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
|echo "sys-boot/systemd-boot" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/systemd-boot
}}

Next, install the {{Package|sys-boot/systemd-boot}} package:

{{Emerge|sys-boot/systemd-boot}}

=== EFI system partition ===

Make sure that an [[EFI System Partition]] (ESP) is available on the system. This is a GPT partition on the disk that is marked as EF00 (EFI System partition).

For instance, to create an ESP using {{Package|sys-apps/gptfdisk}}:

{{RootCmd|gdisk /dev/sda|output=<pre>
Command (? for help): n
Partition number (1-128, default 1): 1
First sector: (enter desired start sector and size, 100 MB should be plenty)
Command (? for help): t
Partition number (1-2): 1
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): EF00
Command (? for help): w
</pre>}}

The filesystem on this partition must be formatted as a FAT variant. FAT32 is recommended:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sda1}}

Mount this location on the system ({{Path|/boot/efi}} works just fine) and create the {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/boot}} location.

{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /boot/efi
|mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi
}}

=== UEFI boot manager ===

The systemd-boot application makes the installation, which only needs to be performed once (unless a new version of systemd-boot needs to be installed), fairly simple. Verify the following:

* The system is booted with EFI to start with (either from a EFI compatible media, or through the Linux kernel with EFI stub support) as it will otherwise fail to install.
* The EFI variable file system (efivars) is mounted read/write:
: {{RootCmd|mount -t efivarfs efivarfs /sys/firmware/efi/efivars}}

Then perform the install itself:

{{RootCmd|bootctl --path /boot/efi install}}

The installation will install the proper EFI files so that the EFI-capable system will boot the systemd-boot bootloader.

== Configuration ==

A boot loader entry needs to be created for each operating system.

Next to the boot loader entries, a small default configuration file can be created as well.

=== Default configuration entries ===

In {{Path|/boot/efi/loader}} a file called {{Path|loader.conf}} can be created which contains at most the following two entries:

; A <code>default</code> entry: specifying which operating system entry to boot by default.
; A <code>timeout</code> entry: specifying the number of seconds to wait before the default boot entry is loaded.

For instance, this would look like so:

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/efi/loader/loader.conf|title=Default settings|1=
default gentoo
timeout 3
}}

The name of the ''default'' entry is the name of the configuration entry file, as created in the next section, without the {{Path|.conf}} suffix.

=== Operating system configuration entries ===

These entry files need to be located in the [[ESP]], in the {{Path|/boot/efi/loader/entries}} location. So if the EFI system partition is mounted at {{Path|/boot/efi}} then this is at {{Path|/boot/efi/loader/entries}}. The following is an example configuration entry named "gentoo":

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/efi/loader/entries/gentoo.conf|title=Gentoo configuration entry|1=
title Gentoo Linux
linux /vmlinuz
options root=/dev/sda3
}}

The ''linux'' entry points to an [[EFI_stub_kernel|EFI stub Linux kernel]] file, installed in the ESP.

Although the [[EFI_stub_kernel|EFI stub kernel]] configuration works fine, it has the downside that

* New Linux kernels are somewhat risky to test out because only a single kernel is booted.
* Adding boot options requires rebuilding the Linux kernel.

With systemd-boot, additional entries can be configured for new Linux kernel tests, and additional boot options are easy to add to the configuration entry file, or even at boot time.

=== One-time boot loader options ===

In order to boot the system with a particular boot option, in the systemd-boot screen, press {{Key|e}} to edit the options.

The changes made in the systemd-boot screen are ''not'' preserved!
