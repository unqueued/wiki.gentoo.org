'''The CHOST variable tells the compiler for which platform code should be build for.'''

Unlike the -march and -mcpu options, which are used for the optimizations, the CHOST variable is rather fixed and cannot be changed easily. For this reason, if you need to switch CHOST variables, Gentoo generally recommends to install with the proper stage3 file.

The CHOST variable is generally set in <code>/etc/make.conf</code>.
