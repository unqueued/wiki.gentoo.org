The '''CHOST''' variable tells the compiler for which platform code should be build for. Unlike the [[CFLAGS]] variable, which is used for the optimizations, the CHOST variable is rather fixed and cannot be changed easily.

The [[profile]] provides the default CHOST, but it can be changed in the {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.

The variable is a dash-separated tuple in the form of ''ARCH''-''VENDOR''-''OS''-''LIBC''. ''ARCH'' specifies the CPU architecture, ''VENDOR'' specifies the hardware platform or vendor, ''OS'' is the operating system, and ''LIBC'' is the C library to use. Only ''ARCH'' is strictly required in all cases, but - for Linux machines at least - it's good practice to specify all four fields. The ''LIBC'' field is not supported for Gentoo/FreeBSD, so for these machines it must always be omitted.

The following table lists some field values known to work:
