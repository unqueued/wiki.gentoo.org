(Introductory paragraph goes here. Describe the hardware. It is okay to mention the hardware platforms friendliness to open source drivers. Optionally, it is nice provide a nice summary of why or why not a user would want to buy this hardware for use with Linux.)

Written using the version with AMD graphics.
