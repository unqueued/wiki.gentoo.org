이 안내서는 명령줄 인터페이스에서 GPM(범용 마우스 서버)을 설치하고 사용하는 방법을 보여드릴 것입니다. 특히 젠투 설치 단계 또는 X서버를 사용하지 않거나 사용할 수 없는 시스템에서 도움이 될 것입니다.

== GPM 가져오기 ==��������

젠투를 설치하고 나서도 아직은 명령줄 인터페이스(CLI)에서 마우스가 동작하도록 설정하지 못했을 것입니다. X 서버를 사용할 수 없거나 필요하지 않은 상황에서도 마우스를 쓸 필요가 있을지도 모릅니다. 이런 상황에서의 해법은 간단한데 <code>gpm</code>, 범용 마우스 서버를 사용하는 것입니다.� 

First, you will need to get GPM: 

{{Emerge|gpm}}

You might have noticed a few messages during the compilation that warned about configuring the server. You must do this before starting GPM. 

== Configuring GPM ==

Before you can use GPM, you will need to uncomment the lines corresponding to the location and protocol of your mouse. You do this by editing the GPM configuration file: 

{{RootCmd|nano /etc/conf.d/gpm}}

In the next example, we have a USB mouse on {{Path|/dev/input/mouse0}}. So, we uncomment {{Path|/dev/input/mice}}, as this is the cumulative device for all mice on the system, and the appropriate protocol. Try using {{Path|/dev/input/mice}} before {{Path|/dev/psaux}}, as the latter is deprecated and can be disabled in more recent kernels. If {{Path|/dev/input/mice}} fails, then fall back to other devices. Here is the example {{Path|/etc/conf.d/gpm}} : 

{{Code|Example GPM config|<pre>
## (Please uncomment the type of mouse you have and the appropriate MOUSEDEV entry)
 
#MOUSE=ps2
MOUSE=imps2
#MOUSEDEV=/dev/psaux
MOUSEDEV=/dev/input/mice
</pre>
}}

If you have a wheelmouse, you will want to use the imps2 protocol, so uncomment that line. If imps2 and ps2 both fail to work for you, please refer to the GPM info page ( <code>info gpm</code> ) for other protocols to try. Also, if you want to be able to click on hyperlinks in terminals to navigate to a website, it is a good idea to follow the suggestion in the <code>/etc/conf.d/gpm</code> file: 

{{Code|Other options|<pre>
## (Please uncomment this line if you want GPM to understand charsets
##  used in URLs and names with ~ or : in them, etc.
##  This is a good idea to turn on!)
 
APPEND="-l \"a-zA-Z0-9_.:~/\300-\326\330-\366\370-\377\""
</pre>
}}

The rest of the conf.d file contains other suggestions for your mouse server; uncomment the various options according to your needs. See <code>man gpm</code> for more information. 

== Running GPM ==

Now that your mouse server is installed and configured, it's time to start using it: 

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/gpm start}}

You should see a block cursor appear. Remember that only root can run the GPM init script. However, to avoid having to <code>su</code> and run the script every single time you begin a new session, why not set GPM to begin every time you turn on your computer? 

{{RootCmd|rc-update add gpm default}}

Now, whenever you start your computer, you'll be greeted by the console cursor by the time you get to the login prompt. The mouse server will continue to run even if you're not logged in as root.

== Working with GPM ==

=== Copying and pasting ===

Copying and pasting large blocks of text with a working mouse server is very easy. Simply highlight the text with the left mouse button (it will stay highlighted when you release the button), switch to a different terminal if you wish, position the cursor, and press the middle mouse button to paste the text where you placed the cursor. Note that you can copy and paste without ever leaving the terminal you started. This makes posting the output of error messages to the [http://forums.gentoo.org Gentoo Forums] extremely simple. 

=== Text-mode browsing and GPM ===

If you have a message on one screen and a text-mode web browser on the other, you can copy the error message by highlighting it, then change to the other terminal, left-click the appropriate text entry box to select it, and then press the middle mouse button. VoilÃ ! Your error message can now be posted to the forums. 

Though discussion of text-only browsers is somewhat beyond the scope of this guide, inevitably users will need to find a compatible console browser. Though <code>lynx</code> is most likely the oldest and well established browser, its interface has poor mouse support and recognition. Instead, try using <code>links</code> which has excellent mouse integration.

This concludes the guide to using a mouse within the console. Happy mousing!
