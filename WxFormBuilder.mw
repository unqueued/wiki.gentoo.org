'''wxFormBuilder''' is [[Article description::an application that can literally speed up GUI development, being Python either C++ the programming language of choice.]]

== Installation ==

To install it, first add the ''gentoo-zh'' [[ebuild repository]]:

{{RootCmd|eselect repository enable gentoo-zh|emerge --sync gentoo-zh}}
or
{{RootCmd|layman -a gentoo-zh}}

Then, since premake-3.7 is currently an ebuild prerequisite, though the core system is already providing premake-4, you have to directly specify it:

{{Emerge|dev-util/premake:3}}

You may now proceed and install {{Package|dev-util/wxFormBuilder}} itself:

{{Emerge|wxformbuilder}}
