wxFormBuilder is an application that can literally speed up GUI development, being ''Python'' either ''C++'' the programming language of your choice.

== Installation ==
To install it, you need to first add the <tt>gentoo-zh</tt> overlay:
{{RootCmd|layman -a gentoo-zh}}

Then, since <tt>premake 3.7</tt> is currently an ebuild prerequisite, though the core system is already providing <tt>premake 4</tt>, you have to directly specify it:
{{RootCmd|emerge {{=}}dev-util/premake-3.7}}

You may now proceed and install wxFormBuilder itself:
{{RootCmd|emerge dev-util/wxformbuilder}}
