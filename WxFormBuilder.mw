'''wxFormBuilder''' is an application that can literally speed up GUI development, being Python either C++ the programming language of your choice.

== Installation ==
To install it, you need to first add the ''gentoo-zh'' [[overlay]]:
{{RootCmd|layman -a gentoo-zh}}

Then, since <tt>premake 3.7</tt> is currently an ebuild prerequisite, though the core system is already providing <tt>premake 4</tt>, you have to directly specify it:
{{Emerge|{{=}}dev-util/premake-3.7}}

You may now proceed and install {{Package|dev-util/wxFormBuilder}} itself:
{{Emerge|wxformbuilder}}
