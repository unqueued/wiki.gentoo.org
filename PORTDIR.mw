The <var>PORTDIR</var> variable was used to point to the main package repository hosted on the system. It has since been {{Bug|546210|text=deprecated}} in favor of the single repositories' <code>location</code> attributes in the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf|/etc/portage/repos.conf]]}} file or directory.

These can be obtained by

{{Cmd|portageq get_repo_path / gentoo|output=/usr/portage}}</onlyinclude>
