|Local Ebuild Testing|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Ensuring ebuilds are working before committing them is a mostly personal process.  A utility that allows one to quickly (one command) run a battery of installation and optionally runtime testing against an ebuild would streamline this process significantly.  The basic requirements are the same as any other test runner: isolated and repeatable.  This work can scope out or in as needed to fit within time constraints.|
