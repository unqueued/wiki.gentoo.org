== Kernel module ==
The Apple keyboards requires the '''hid_apple''' kernel module to work. 

== Configuration ==
By default, ''F<num>'' keys are not enabled but the alternatives. If you want the traditional mode, execute as root:
    # echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode

If you have a non-English layout, maybe the < and > keys have changed place with ^ and Â°. To fix that:
    # echo 0 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout 

If you compile hid_apple inside the kernel, you can add the two previous commands to ''/etc/local.d/hid_apple.start''
following the [[local.d|local.d guide]]. 

If you compile it as module, you can add the options to the module loading 
following the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/openrc-migration.xml#doc_chap2 OpenRC migration guide]:
{{RootCmd|/etc/conf.d/modules|output=<pre>
...
    module_hid_apple_args="fnmode=2 iso_layout=0"
...
</pre>}}
