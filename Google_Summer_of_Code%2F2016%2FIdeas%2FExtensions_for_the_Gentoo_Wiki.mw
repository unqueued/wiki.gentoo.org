{{GSoCIdea|Extensions for the Gentoo Wiki|year=2016|
If you're reading this, you're on the Gentoo Wiki. It has been the main documentation source for Gentoo for well over two years now.
We have plenty of content, but need a few things added to the software, MediaWiki, to provide even better documentation. Here's a few things that need to be done:

* Create a document export pipeline for PDF and common e-reader formats for the [[Handbook:Main_Page|Gentoo Handbook]] that renders beautiful, print-quality files containing our most important piece of documentation whenever it is updated.
* Improve Handbook navigation on smartphones: Currently, we share the Handbook navigation on all screen sizes in the form of a large box floating to the right of the content. That doesn't work on small screens. Your task is to think up and implement a better replacement.
* Fork-a-page: We have quite a few content pages on the Wiki that are restricted. We'd like a way for contributors to fork pages that are read-only for them, implement improvements, and allow the privileged developers to merge them back in easily.
* Kernel configuration documentation: Currently, we manually copy-paste the output of {{c|menuconfig}} entries to visualize Kernel configuration changes people need to get certain things done. We can do better: This extension should be able to ingest a set of {{c|.config}} parameters (<code>CONFIG_FOO{{=}}M</code>) and render the location and description for a set of current kernel versions.

The above list is neither exhaustive nor compulsory. We'll define a good set of tasks depending on your interests and abilities. If you have other tasks that you think need doing, do let us know.
