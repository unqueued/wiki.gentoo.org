Dagrab is a CD ripper, might be faster than others. It can be used as a backend to abcde ({{package|media-sound/abcde}}), instead of cdparanoia (or libcdio-paranoia). Standalone use is also possible.

Dagrab is a very old software. As of 2017, most major Linux distributions don't provide dagrab. Fortuanetly in Gentoo it's still available as {{package|media-sound/dagrab}}.

== History ==
In fact, dagrab was forked. The orignal version was initiated by Marcello Urbani, from Feb 1998 to 2000. Its homepage, [http://web.tiscalinet.it/marcellou/dagrab.html http://web.tiscalinet.it/marcellou/dagrab.html], is available as of 2017.

In Dec 1998 Miroslav Stibor released a forked version. The last release was in 2004. Its [http://vertigo.fme.vutbr.cz/~stibor/dagrab.html homepage] was there until c. 2011. It can be [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://vertigo.fme.vutbr.cz/~stibor/dagrab.html viewed] by Wayback.

Gentoo provides the forked version, the last release 0.513. (The author versionated it as "S0.513".)

== Use with abcde ==
If CD ripping is slow with abcde (taking > 4 min. to rip a CD), use dagrab.

{{package|media-sound/abcde}}, a command-line CD encoder, relies on cdparanoia (or libcdio-paranoia) as a ripper. On some hardwares, cdparanoia is slow; setting the speed by the option {{c|-S}} has no effect.

To use dagrab, emerge abcde >= 2.7. The configuration file, {{path|/etc/abcde.conf}} or {{path|$HOME/.abcde.conf}} should have the following lines:

{{CodeBox|1=
CDROMREADERSYNTAX=dagrab
# "-n 8" is the dagrab's default. For recent drives, 127 is a good try.
DAGRABOPTS="-n 127"
}}

{{c|DAGRABOPTS}} is the options to pass to dagrab. For the details, run {{c|$ dagrab -h}}, and see the dagrab's FAQ file, found at {{path|/usr/share/doc/dagrab-<version #>/FAQ.bz2}}.

{{c|DAGRABOPTS}} is not documented up to abcde-2.8.1, but was fixed in [https://git.einval.com/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=abcde.git;a=commit;h=c91ca32ad9ecd236324065bfa075ce388e9c75af this upstream commit].
