This guide [[Article description::shows how to navigate info pages using the {{c|info}} command.]]

== Introduction ==

=== What is info? ===

Most users may be familiar with the {{c|man}} documentation system. While man is good with quickly looking up items, it lacks structure in linking man pages together. This is where {{c|info}} comes in. Info pages are made using the {{c|texinfo}} tools, and can link with other pages, create menus and ease navigation in general. The next section will look at how info pages are laid out.

=== Info pages layout ===

The main info pages are held in {{Path|/usr/share/info}}. Unlike the man style directory layout, {{Path|/usr/share/info}} contains what is largely a rather extensive collection of files. These files have the following format: 

{{CodeBox|title=info file format|1=
pagename.info[-node].gz
}}

<code>pagename</code> is the actual name of the page (example: <code>wget</code>). <code>[-node]</code> is an optional construct that designates another node level (generally these are referenced to by the toplevel of the info document in question). In order to save space these info pages are compressed using the gzip compression scheme by default. Configure the <var>PORTAGE_COMPRESS</var> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} to choose different compression algorithms. Additional info pages can be listed with the <var>INFOPATH</var> environment variable (usually set through the various {{Path|/etc/env.d/}} files). To get started, it's important to note the {{Path|/usr/share/info/dir}} file. This special file is used when info is ran with no parameters. It contains a listing of all info pages available for users to browse. To begin looking at navigating around in info, bring it up with no arguments: 

{{Cmd|info}}

The next chapter describes how to deal with basic info navigation.

== Working with info pages ==

=== Browsing with menus ===

Now that info is started, the screen will be similar to this:

{{CodeBox|title=Sample info screen|1=
File: dir,      Node: Top       This is the top of the INFO tree
 
  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics.
  Typing "q" exits, "?" lists all Info commands, "d" returns here,
  "h" gives a primer for first-timers,
  "mEmacs<Return>" visits the Emacs manual, etc.
 
  In Emacs, you can click mouse button 2 on a menu item or cross reference
  to select it.
 
* Menu:
 
User Interface Toolkit
* GDK: (gdk).           The General Drawing Kit
* GTK: (gtk).           The GIMP Toolkit
 
GNU programming tools
* Autoconf v2.1: (autoconf).         Create source code configuration scripts.
}}

Right now there are a bunch of entries with an asterisk before them. These are menu items for navigating through different node levels. There are two ways of selecting menus. The first way will be described now and the other one later. First off, in order to  look at the wget info page, use the {{Key|↓}} arrow key until reaching the line for wget:

{{CodeBox|title=Navigating to the wget info menu entry|1=
Network Applications
* GnuTLS: (gnutls).                     Package for Transport Layer Security.
* Wget: (wget).         The non-interactive network downloader.
* certtool: (gnutls)Invoking certtool.  Manipulate certificates and keys.
* gnutls-cli: (gnutls)Invoking gnutls-cli.      GNU TLS test client.
* gnutls-cli-debug: (gnutls)Invoking gnutls-cli-debug.  GNU TLS debug client.
* gnutls-serv: (gnutls)Invoking gnutls-serv.    GNU TLS test server.
* srptool: (gnutls)Invoking srptool.    Simple SRP password tool.
}}

Once on this line, hit the {{Key|Enter}} key to select the menu item. This will bring up the info page for wget: 

{{CodeBox|title=The wget info page|1=
File: wget.info,  Node: Top,  Next: Overview,  Up: (dir)

}}

The next section will look at basic navigation.

=== Basic navigation ===

In terms of nodes, this is considered the <code>Top</code> node for the wget page. Consider the <code>Top</code> node to be the same as the table of contents for that particular info page. Now to navigate the actual page itself, users have a couple of different methods. First off is the standard info method. This is using the {{Key|Space}} key to move forward a page and the {{Key|Backspace}}/{{Key|Delete}} keys to move back a page. This is the recommended method as it automatically advances/retreats to the appropriate node in the document. This allows for a somewhat linear browsing for those used to man pages. Another way is through the {{Key|Page up}}/{{Key|Page down}} keys. These work, but they will not advance/retreat like {{Key|Space}}/{{Key|Backspace}}/{{Key|Delete}} will. In order to skip entire nodes without using {{Key|Space}}/{{Key|Backspace}}/{{Key|Delete}}, users can also use the {{Key|[}} (advance backwards) and {{Key|]}} (advance forwards) keys. 

As mentioned earlier, there are two ways of navigating menus. The other way will now be described here. The numbers <code>1-9</code> can be used to reference to the first-ninth menu entries in a document. This can be used to quickly peruse through documents. For example, users can press {{Key|3}} to reach the <code>Recursive Download</code> menu entry. So press {{Key|3}} and it will bring up the <code>Recursive Download</code> screen: 

{{CodeBox|title=Resulting Recursive Download screen|1=
File: wget.info,  Node: Recursive Download,  Next: Following Links,  Prev: Invoking,  Up: Top
 
3 Recursive Download
********************
 
GNU Wget is capable of traversing parts of the Web (or a single HTTP or
FTP server), following links and directory structure.  We refer to this
as to "recursive retrieval", or "recursion".
}}

Here is a good time to note a few things. First off the top header section. This header shows the navigation capable from this particular screen. The page indicated by <code>Next:</code> can be accessed by pressing the {{Key|n}} key, and the page indicated by <code>Prev:</code> can be accessed by pressing the {{Key|p}} key. Please note that this will only work for the same level. If overused users could round up in totally unrelated content. It's better to use {{Key|Space}}/{{Key|Backspace}}/{{Key|Delete}}/{{Key|[}}/{{Key|]}} to navigate in a linear fashion. 

If for some reason users get lost, there are a few ways to get out. First is the {{Key|t}} key. This will take the user straight to the toplevel (table of contents) for the particular info page being browsed. If users want to return to the last page looked out, they can do so with the {{Key|l}} key. If users want to go to the above level, they can do so with the {{Key|u}} key. The next chapter will look at searching for content.

== Searching through info ==

=== Navigating to other info pages ===

Now that users can navigate an individual info page, it's important to look at accessing other info pages. The first obvious way is to go to the info page through the dir index listing of info pages. To get to the dir index from deep within a document, simply press the {{Key|d}} key. From there users can search for the appropriate page they want. However, if they know the actual page, there is an easier way through the <code>Goto node ({{Key|g}} key)</code> command. To go to an info page by name, type {{Key|g}} to bring up the prompt and enter the name of the page in parentheses: 

{{CodeBox|title=Going to an info page by name|1=
* Startup File::        Wget's initialization file.
* Examples::            Examples of usage.
* Various::             The stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else.
* Appendices::          Some useful references.
* Copying::             You may give out copies of Wget and of this manual.
--zz-Info: (wget.info.gz)Top, 24 lines --Top-------------------------------
Goto node: (libc)
}}

This will bring up the libc page as shown here: 

{{CodeBox|title=Result of the Goto node command|1=
File: libc.info,  Node: Top,  Next: Introduction,  Prev: (dir),  Up: (dir)
 
Main Menu

This is Edition 0.10, last updated 2001-07-06, of `The GNU C Library
Reference Manual', for Version 2.3.x of the GNU C Library.
 
* Menu:
 
* Introduction::                 Purpose of the GNU C Library.
}}

Now that users know how to go to info pages by name, the next section will look at searching for pieces of information using the info page's index.

=== Searching using an index ===

The following example will describe how to lookup the <code>printf</code> function of the C library using the libc info page's index. Users should still be at the libc info page from the last section, and if not, they can use the Goto node command to do so. To utilize the index search, hit the {{Key|i}} key to bring up the prompt, then enter the search term:

{{CodeBox|title=Entering an index search query|1=
* Character Set Handling::       Support for extended character sets.
* Locales::                      The country and language can affect the
                                   behavior of library functions.
* Message Translation::          How to make the program speak the user's
                                   language.
--zz-Info: (libc.info.gz)Top, 1291 lines --Top-- Subfile: libc.info-1.gz-----
Index entry: printf
}}

After pressing enter upon completion of our query, users are brought to the libc definition for <code>printf</code>: 

{{CodeBox|title=Result of the index search query|1=
File: libc.info,  Node: Formatted Output Functions,  Next: Dynamic Output,  Prev: Other Output Conversions,  Up: Formatted Output
 
12.12.7 Formatted Output Functions
----------------------------------
 
This section describes how to call `printf' and related functions.
Prototypes for these functions are in the header file `stdio.h'.
Because these functions take a variable number of arguments, you _must_
declare prototypes for them before using them.  Of course, the easiest
way to make sure you have all the right prototypes is to just include
}}

Users have successfully performed a search using the <code>libc</code> info page index. However, sometimes what users want is in the page itself. The next section will look at performing searches within the page.

=== Searching using the search command ===

Starting from the previous location at the <code>Formatted Output Functions</code> node, users will look at searching for the <code>sprintf</code> variation of the <code>printf</code> function. To perform a search, press the {{Key|s}} key to bring up the search prompt, and then enter the query (sprintf in this case): 

{{CodeBox|title=Entering a search query|1=
 -- Function: int wprintf (const wchar_t *TEMPLATE, ...)
     The `wprintf' function prints the optional arguments under the
     control of the wide template string TEMPLATE to the stream
     `stdout'.  It returns the number of wide characters printed, or a
--zz-Info: (libc.info.gz)Formatted Output Functions, 127 lines --Top-- Subfile: libc.info-3.gz--
Search for string []: sprintf
}}

Hit {{Key|Enter}} and it will show the result of the query: 

{{CodeBox|title=Result of the search query|1=
-- Function: int sprintf (char *S, const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This is like `printf', except that the output is stored in the
     character array S instead of written to a stream.  A null
     character is written to mark the end of the string.
 
     The `sprintf' function returns the number of characters stored in
     the array S, not including the terminating null character.
}}

This is the needed function.

== Conclusion ==

This concludes the overview of using info to view info pages. As always comments are both welcome and appreciated.

=== Additional program resources ===

In order to make things easier for those that wish to browse info pages through a more friendly graphical interface, the following are available: 

* {{Package|app-text/info2html}} - Convert info pages to a browse-able HTML format
* {{Package|app-text/pinfo}} - {{c|ncurses}} based info viewer
* {{Package|app-text/tkinfo}} - A tcl/tk based info browser
* {{Package|app-vim/info}} - A {{c|vim}} based info browser

The KDE browser Konqueror also allows users to browse info pages through the <code>info:</code> URI.
