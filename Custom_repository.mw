Someone handed you an ebuild, and you don't know what to do with it? Fear not, for here be instructions!

== Creating a local overlay ==
You can create a local overlay with a few easy steps.
{{RootCmd
| mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/{metadata,profiles}
| echo 'NameOfYourOverlay' > /usr/local/portage/profiles/repo_name
| echo 'masters {{=}}  gentoo' > /usr/local/portage/metadata/layout.conf
| chown -R portage:portage /usr/local/portage}}

Next, tell portage about the overlay.
{{RootCmd|echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY{{=}}"/usr/local/portage ${PORTDIR_OVERLAY}"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

== Adding an ebuild to the overlay ==
Now that the basic layout is in order, you can add an ebuild to the overlay. In this example, {{Package|app-dicts/artha-1.0.2}}. We will assume the ebuild is in the homedir of the user ''myuser'', and named '''artha-1.0.2.ebuild'''.
{{RootCmd
| mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/app-dicts/artha
| cp ~myuser/artha-1.0.2.ebuild /usr/local/portage/app-dicts/artha/artha-1.0.2.ebuild
| pushd /usr/local/portage/app-dicts/artha
| repoman manifest
| popd
| chown -R portage:portage /usr/local/portage}}

You should now be able to install the package from your overlay with emerge.
{{RootCmd|emerge -av1 app-dicts/artha}}
