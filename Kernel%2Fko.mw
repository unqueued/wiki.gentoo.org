'''리눅스 커널'은 운영체제의 핵심이며 하드웨어에 접근할 프로그램용 인터페이스를 제공합니다. 커널에는 대부분의 수많은 장치 드라이버가 있습니다.

== Installation ==

To create a kernel, it is necessary to install the kernel source code first. The recommended kernel sources for a desktop system are {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}. These are maintained by the Gentoo developers, and patched to fix security vulnerabilities, functional problems, as well as to improve compatibility with rare system architectures.

Before installing, check the active USE flags:

{{USEflag|package=sys-kernel/gentoo-sources
|build++no
|deblob
|symlink
}}

Now install '''gentoo-sources''':

{{Emerge|gentoo-sources}}

There are various alternative kernel sources in the Portage tree:

* {{Package|sys-kernel/vanilla-sources}} - The official, non-patched Linux kernel sources. Note that because they are left as is, and do not contain any additional patches, they are not supported by Gentoo developers.

* A full list with short descriptions can be found by searching with emerge:

: {{Emerge|params=--search|sources}}
