<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Gentoo has long used a common text file based layout to store information about currently installed packages on the system. For [https://github.com/pkgcore/pkgcore pkgcore], it would be nice to move on to something more efficient and yet remain modular enough to support various tools that need access to the data. Leveraging a well-structured sqlite datastore would probably work very well along with the proper API support from pkgcore (and/or libebuild).
