<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Gentoo has long used a common text file based layout to store information about currently installed packages on the system. For pkgcore, it would be nice to move on to something more efficient and yet remain modular enough to support various tools that need access to the data. Leveraging a well-structured sqlite datastore would probably work very well along with the proper API support from pkgcore (and/or libebuild).
