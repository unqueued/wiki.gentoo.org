'''xombrero''' is a minimalistic web browser striving to be compact, secure, and fast.

==Overview==
The principal difference between xombrero and other full-featured browsers is that the sophisticated security features are designed in, rather than added through an add-on after-the-fact. With a strong accent on staying out of the way, it doesn't decide for you what search engine you want to use or what certificate authority you want to trust. Heavy vim users will also find its vim-like keybindings convenient, as it is easy to surf the web completely from keyboard.

==Installation==
{{USEflag|package=www-client/xombrero
|examples
}}

Install {{Package|www-client/xombrero}}:
{{emerge|www-client/xombrero}}

==Configuration==
The configuration file is named {{Path|~/.xombrero.conf}} and located in the home directory by default. Starting xombrero with the command-line parameter <code>-f</code>, one can select a different configuration file, located anywhere on the system. This is convenient for separating different browsing activities, e.q. browsing with or without Tor, or accessing a bank account with a browser configured to accept cookies and run javascript, and surfing the web with a more secure configuration. The browser can be started like so:
{{Cmd
|xombrero -f .xombrero.conf
|xombrero -f .torbrowser.conf
}}

To simplify configuration xombrero allows to choose between two high-level modes of browsing:  browser_mode and gui_mode. Each mode represents a number of low-level settings.
{{Note|browser_mode and gui_mode MUST be the first entries in the configuration file!}}

===Browser mode===
Most users should use browser_mode and shoudln't tweak low-level settings manually unless they know what they are doing. There are two modes: <code>normal</code> and <code>whitelist</code>. Each of this modes and the settings they enable are listed below:

The settings for "browser_mode=normal" are as follows:
<pre>
# allow_volatile_cookies        = 0
# cookie_policy                 = allow
# cookies_enabled               = 1
# enable_cookie_whitelist       = 0
# read_only_cookies             = 0
# save_rejected_cookies         = 0
# session_timeout               = 3600
# enable_scripts                = 1
# enable_js_whitelist           = 0
# enable_localstorage           = 1
# enable_plugins                = 1
# enable_plugin_whitelist       = 0
# allow_insecure_content        = 1
# allow_insecure_scripts        = 1
# do_not_track                  = 0
</pre>

The settings for "browser_mode = whitelist" are as follows:
<pre>
# allow_volatile_cookies        = 0
# cookie_policy                 = no3rdparty
# cookies_enabled               = 1
# enable_cookie_whitelist       = 1
# read_only_cookies             = 0
# save_rejected_cookies         = 0
# session_timeout               = 3600
# enable_scripts                = 0
# enable_js_whitelist           = 1
# enable_localstorage           = 0
# enable_plugins                = 0
# enable_plugin_whitelist       = 1
# allow_insecure_content        = 0
# allow_insecure_scripts        = 0
# do_not_track                  = 1
</pre>
Of course, these settings can be overridden later in the xombrero configuration file. See the xombrero man page for a more detailed explanation of each of them. The :set command can be used in order to view the enabled settings. 

In addition to the browser modes listed above, there is also a number of other parameters, which can be set in .xombrero.conf. Examples of them are:
