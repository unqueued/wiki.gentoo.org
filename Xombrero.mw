{{Lowercase title}}

'''xombrero''' is a minimalistic web browser striving to be compact, secure, and fast.

The principal difference between xombrero and other full-featured browsers is that the sophisticated security features are designed in, rather than added through an add-on after-the-fact. With a strong accent on staying out of the way, it doesn't decide for you what search engine you want to use or what certificate authority you want to trust. Heavy vim users will also find its vim-like keybindings convenient, as it is easy to surf the web completely from keyboard.
