Using a standard [https://gentoo.org/downloads/ stage3] installation everything should pretty much work out of the box.
== Keyboard ==
for some reason on kernels >= 4.2 the keyboard, trackpoint and touchpad are not working on the first boot. To work around this problem add '''i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset''' to your kernel command line:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default.grub|title=add to kernel command line|1=
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset"
}}

== WiFi ==
the wifi chip is a '''Intel Wireless-N 2230''' as lspic shows
<pre>
03:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 2230 (rev c4)
</pre>

enable the required kernel modules:

            < >       Intel Wireless WiFi MVM Firmware support
</pre>
the modules need an additional firmware 
{{RootCmd
| emerge linux-firmware
}}

if you are building the modules directly into the kernel enable  the '''Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary''' option
<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
 
            Generic Driver Options  --->
 
            -*- Userspace firmware loading support
            [*]   Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary

== Audio / Video ==
the sound card work out of the box for usb mic/soundcard enable:
<pre>
Device Drivers  ---> 
      <*> Sound card support  ---> 
          <*>   Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  ---> 
              [*]   USB sound devices  ---> 
                  <M>   USB Audio/MIDI driver
</pre>

the integratged webcam is also USB

<pre>
Device Drivers --->
    <M> Multimedia support --->
      [*] Media USB Adapters --->
        [M] USB Video Class (UVC)
</pre>

== Card Reader ==
the card reader is an '''RTS5229 PCI Express Card Reader''' - the driver comes with a package rather than with the kernel itself so make sure to deselect:
<pre>
Device Drivers --->
    Misc devices--->
      < > Realtek PCI-E card reader
</pre>
and emerge
{{RootCmd
| emerge rts5229
}}
don't forget to re-emerge when installing a new kernel
