Using a standard [https://gentoo.org/downloads/ stage3] installation everything should pretty much work out of the box.
== Keyboard ==
for some reason on kernels >= 4.2 the keyboard, trackpoint and touchpad are not working on the first boot. To work around this problem add '''i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset''' to your kernel command line:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default.grub|title=add to kernel command line|1=
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset"
}}

== WiFi ==
the wifi chip is a '''Intel Wireless-N 2230''' as lspci shows
<pre>
03:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 2230 (rev c4)
</pre>

enable the required kernel modules:
{{KernelBox|
Device Drivers  --->
  [*] Network device support  --->
    [*]   Wireless LAN  --->
      [ ]   ADMtek devices
      [ ]   Atheros/Qualcomm devices
      [ ]   Atmel devices
      [ ]   Broadcom devices
      [ ]   Cisco devices
      [*]   Intel devices
      < >     Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network Connection
      < >     Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG and 2915ABG Network Connection
      < >     Intel Wireless WiFi 4965AGN (iwl4965)
      < >     Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG/BG Network Connection (iwl3945)
      <M/*>   Intel Wireless WiFi Next Gen AGN - Wireless-N/Advanced-N/Ultimate-N (iwlwifi)
      <M/*>   Intel Wireless WiFi DVM Firmware support
      < >     Intel Wireless WiFi MVM Firmware support
}}
the modules need an additional firmware 
{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}

if you are building the modules directly into the kernel enable  the '''Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary''' option
{{KernelBox|
Device Drivers  --->
  Generic Driver Options  --->
    -*- Userspace firmware loading support
    [*]   Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
    (iwlwifi-2030-6.ucode) External firmware blobs to build into the kernel binary
    (/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
    [ ] Fallback user-helper invocation for firmware 
}}
see [[Iwlwifi#When_using_built-in_configuration|When using built in configuration]]

== Audio / Video ==
The sound card work out of the box for USB mic/soundcard enable:
{{KernelBox|
Device Drivers  ---> 
      <*> Sound card support  ---> 
          <*>   Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  ---> 
              [*]   USB sound devices  ---> 
                  <M>   USB Audio/MIDI driver
}}

The integrated webcam is also USB:

{{KernelBox|
Device Drivers --->
    <M> Multimedia support --->
      [*] Media USB Adapters --->
        [M] USB Video Class (UVC)
}}

== Card Reader ==
the card reader is an '''RTS5229 PCI Express Card Reader''' - the driver comes with a package rather than with the kernel itself so make sure to deselect:
{{KernelBox|
Device Drivers --->
    Misc devices--->
      < > Realtek PCI-E card reader
}}
and emerge
{{Emerge|sys-block/rts5229}}

don't forget to re-emerge when installing a new kernel
