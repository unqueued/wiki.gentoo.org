This article describes the setup of [[Bluetooth]] input devices.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need [[Bluetooth]] and [[evdev]] support. Also you need to activate the following kernel options:
{{KernelBox|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] HID Devices  --->

          You may need some special driver for your input device:
          Special HID drivers  --->
                <*> ...

[*] Networking support  --->
    <*>   Bluetooth subsystem support  --->
          <*>   L2CAP protocol support
          <*>   HIDP protocol support
</pre>}}

== Configuration ==
To configure the input devices use the specialized desktop management tools:
* {{Package|net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth}} for [[GNOME]]
* {{Package|net-wireless/bluedevil}} for [[KDE]]

Some bluetooth input devices are initially not in the HID mode, but in HCI mode.
This is handled by ''udev'' in {{Path|/lib/udev/rules.d/97-hid2hci.rules}}. Additional devices can be added in a custom rule file which needs to be placed in {{Path|/etc/udev/rules.d}}. See als the [[Udev#Rules|udev]] article for more details.
