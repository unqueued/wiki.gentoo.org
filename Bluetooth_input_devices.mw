This article describes the setup of [[Bluetooth]] input devices.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need [[Bluetooth]] and [[evdev]] support. Also you need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] HID Devices  --->

          ''You may need some special driver for your input device:''
          Special HID drivers  --->
                <*> ...

[*] Networking support  --->
    <*>   Bluetooth subsystem support  --->
          <*>   L2CAP protocol support
          <*>   HIDP protocol support
</pre>}}

== Configuration ==
To configure the input devices use the specialized desktop management tools:
* {{Package|net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth}} for [[GNOME]]
* {{Package|net-wireless/bluedevil}} for [[KDE]]

Some bluetooth input devices are initially not in the HID mode, but in HCI mode. To change this at boot time set an option in the <tt>/etc/conf.d/bluetooth</tt> file:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/bluetooth||
HID2HCI_ENABLE{{=}}true
}}
