This article describes the setup of [[Bluetooth]] input devices.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need [[Bluetooth]] and [[evdev]] support. Also you need to activate the following kernel options:
{{KernelBox|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] HID Devices  --->

          You may need some special driver for your input device:
          Special HID drivers  --->
                <*> ...

[*] Networking support  --->
    <*>   Bluetooth subsystem support  --->
          <*>   L2CAP protocol support
          <*>   HIDP protocol support
</pre>}}

=== BlueZ settings ===

Change the value of <var>UserspaceHID</var> to <code>true</code> in {{Path|/etc/bluetooth/input.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/bluetooth/input.conf|1=
# Enable HID protocol handling in userspace input profile
# Defaults to false (HIDP handled in HIDP kernel module)
UserspaceHID=true
}}

== Configuration ==

To configure the input devices use the specialized desktop management tools:

* {{Package|net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth}} for [[GNOME]]
* {{Package|kde-plasma/bluedevil}} for [[KDE]]
* {{Package|net-wireless/blueman}} is a generic GTK+ client (i.e. for use with Openbox/i3, etc)
<br>
Some Bluetooth input devices are initially not in HID mode, but in HCI mode. This is handled by udev in {{Path|/lib/udev/rules.d/97-hid2hci.rules}}. Additional devices can be added in a custom rule file which needs to be placed in {{Path|/etc/udev/rules.d}}. Refer to the [[Udev#Rules|udev]] article for more details.
