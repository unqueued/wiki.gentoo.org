'''The layman application is Gentoo's primary [[Overlay|overlay]] management tool, offering centralized repository management for the end user.'''

With {{Package|app-portage/layman}} users can manage their overlays in a simple, centralized manner. The layman application provides an overview of available remote overlay repositories and allows the user to select one or more for his system. Once selected, the user can update the repositories (similar to '''emerge --sync'''), add his local overlays, and more.

=== Installing layman ===

Installing layman is a breeze. First check the USE flags that the layman package supports; most of the USE flags trigger which kinds of remote repository types layman supports (such as git repositories, cvs repositories ...). Then install the layman package

{{Emerge|app-portage/layman}}

Next, edit <code>/etc/make.conf</code> to include the following line (preferably at the top of the file):

{{File|/etc/make.conf|Layman-specific entry in make.conf|source /var/lib/layman/make.conf}}

This will ensure that Portage, when asked, will also check the content of the various overlays managed by layman.

=== Using layman ===

The layman manual page (see [[#Resources|Resources]]) provides a full overview of the available functions within layman. However, for most people, the following commands suffice for their overlay management activities.

To have a list of all the overlays, type:
{{RootCmd|layman -L}}

To add an overlay in the list, type:
{{RootCmd|layman -a <name>}}

To remove an overlay from the local list, type:
{{RootCmd|layman -d <name>}}

To update all overlays, type:
{{RootCmd|layman -S}}
