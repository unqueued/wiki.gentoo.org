This article describes the setup of a Wifi network device.

== Wifi during installation  ==

If a Wifi connection is needed while installing Gentoo, note that the Gentoo minimal install CD has a limited number of drivers available, and provides only wpa_cli (and not wpa_gui) for configuring for WPA/WPA2/Enterprise connections.

If the minimal install CD does not contain the required drivers or the graphical frontend to [[wpa_supplicant]] is preferred, choose a different live CD such as the [http://sysresccd.org System Rescue CD]. Be aware that some [[Installation_alternatives#Installation_from_non-Gentoo_LiveCDs|special steps]] may be required when using a non-Gentoo live CD.

== Hardware detection ==

First detect the Wifi controllers. {{c|[[Hardware detection#lspci|lspci]]}} or {{c|[[Hardware detection#lsusb|lsusb]]}} are command-line tools that can be used for this task. 

If a Linux (LiveCD/USB) is booted that makes a Wifi connection:

{{RootCmd|lspci -k}}

The driver will be identified with <code>Kernel driver in use:</code>.

If the booted system does not make a Wifi connection, then obtain a full list of hardware identifiers from the current system. This list can be used to identify the proper driver later:

{{RootCmd|lspci -n}}

Copy the list of PCIID's that the command produces and paste it at http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/.

For USB devices, a similar approach can be taken. First obtain the list of detected USB devices on the system:

{{Cmd|lsusb}}

This command produces the PCI ID, manufacturer, make, model, and/or chipset of every USB device attached to the system. Of these, the chipset may be the most useful information. Googling ''linuxwireless.org <chipset>'' is often the shortest way to find a USB NIC driver and firmware name.

Alternatively, {{c|lshw}} can be used to obtain the necessary information:

{{RootCmd|lshw {{!}} grep -i driver}}

This command produces a list of all drivers, regardless of the device being PCI or USB based.

== Kernel ==

With the drivers identified, it is time to configure the Linux kernel.

=== IEEE 802.11 ===

{{:Wifi/IEEE 802.11}}

=== WEXT ===

The "cfg80211 wireless extensions compatibility" option aka WEXT will support old [[Handbook:Parts/Networking/Wireless#Wireless_tools|wireless-tools]] & [https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/documentation/iw/replace-iwconfig iwconfig].

{{KernelBox|1=
[*] Networking support  --->
    [*] Wireless  --->
        [*]     cfg80211 wireless extensions compatibility
}}

=== Device drivers ===

Next the right set of corresponding kernel options need to be enabled, based on the drivers and hardware detected previously. The [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7640140.html#7640140 recommendation] is to build [[Kernel_Modules#Compile-in-kernel_modules_vs_Loadable_kernel_modules_.28LKMs.29|drivers as modules]]. Also be sure to enable AES cipher support in the kernel if the wireless network uses WPA or WPA2 encryption.

{{KernelBox|<pre>
    Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Network device support  --->
        [*] Wireless LAN  --->
 
            Select the driver for your Wifi network device, e.g.:
            <M> Broadcom 43xx wireless support (mac80211 stack) (b43)
            [M]    Support for 802.11n (N-PHY) devices
            [M]    Support for low-power (LP-PHY) devices
            [M]    Support for HT-PHY (high throughput) devices
            <M> Intel Wireless WiFi Next Gen AGN - Wireless-N/Advanced-N/Ultimate-N (iwlwifi)
            <M>    Intel Wireless WiFi DVM Firmware support                             
            <M>    Intel Wireless WiFi MVM Firmware support
            <M> Intel Wireless WiFi 4965AGN (iwl4965)
            <M> Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG/BG Network Connection (iwl3945)
            <M> Ralink driver support  --->
                <M>   Ralink rt27xx/rt28xx/rt30xx (USB) support (rt2800usb)
 
-*- Cryptographic API --->
    -*- AES cipher algorithms
    -*- AES cipher algorithms (x86_64)
    <*> AES cipher algorithms (AES-NI)
</pre>}}

{{Important|In case the driver is built into the kernel (<code><*></code>) instead of as a module (<code><M></code>), then the firmware needs to be built [[Kernel_Modules#Compile-in-kernel_modules_vs_Loadable_kernel_modules_.28LKMs.29|into the kernel]] as well.
<br />Do not forget to [[Kernel/Rebuild|rebuild the kernel]] after changing its configuration.}}

=== LED support ===

To enable LED triggers for different packet receive/transmit events, compile the kernel with the following options:

{{KernelBox|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] LED Support  --->
        <*>   LED Class Support
 
[*] Networking support  --->
    [*] Wireless  --->
        [*] Enable LED triggers
</pre>
}}

== Firmware ==

In addition to the kernel driver, some chipsets also require firmware. If required, locate it on the following list and install it:

If the driver requires firmware but does not appear on the list, it will be necessary to download it manually and place it in {{Path|/lib/firmware}}.

=== dmesg ===

If none of these methods work be sure to check {{c|dmesg}} output for errors. It is likely a kernel driver or module has not been loaded properly:

{{Cmd|dmesg}}
