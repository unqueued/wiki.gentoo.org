This HOWTO explains how to setup persistence on the liveDVD media.

== Introduction ==


=== Persistence Mode ===
The latest Gentoo LiveDVD offers the option of using persistence to store changes on the USB. It uses aufs to layer a read-write file system on top of a read-only squashfs compressed file system. This is great, because it allows you to make changes to the livedvd and have those changes appear on future reboots. 

=== Requirements ===
In order to have persistent data on the latest livedvd you will need to meet the following requirements

# At least 256M of free writable space available
# Writable device i.e (usb stick, hard drive or ssd)

== Setup Instructions ==

=== Writable partition ===
You need to setup a writable file system on the existing usb stick that you use to boot your livedvd, by creating an extra primary partition. This assumes you already ran {{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/path/to/image.iso of{{=}}/dev/sdc bs{{=}}8192k}} on your usb stick but these instructions can work on any writable media. This HOWTO assumes your writable device is /dev/sdc.

# Create the primary partition on /dev/sdc {{RootCmd|fdisk /dev/sdc}}
# Create file system. We will assume that partition is /dev/sdc4
# {{RootCmd|mke2fs -t ext2 -L aufs-rw /dev/sdc4}}

=== Boot liveDVD ===
You may now boot your media and when prompted for the kernel to use, edit the kernel line and add (aufs=/dev/sdc4) everytime you boot the system, this will allow persistence and write all changes into /dev/sdc4.
