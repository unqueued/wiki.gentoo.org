This HOWTO explains how to setup persistence on the liveDVD media.

== Introduction ==


=== Persistence Mode ===
The latest Gentoo LiveDVD offers the option of using persistence to store changes on the USB. It uses aufs to layer a read-write file system on top of a read-only squashfs compressed file system. This is great, because it allows you to make changes to the livedvd and have those changes appear on future reboots. 

=== Requirements ===
In order to have persistent data on the latest livedvd you will need to meet the following requirements

# At least 256M of free writable space available
# Writable device i.e (usb stick, hard drive or ssd)
