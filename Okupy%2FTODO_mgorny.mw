* Support storing site permissions and SReg choices in the database,
* Support Attribute Exchange equivalents of SReg data,
* Add more fields to SReg as soon as the LDAPUser model is updated,
* Fix redirect-after-login.

== Other tasks ==
* Investigate the [http://test-id.org/OP/ReplayProtection.aspx replay protection] test failure.
Initial testing can be done with the help of the [http://www.openid-ldap.org/test.php OpenID-LDAP test] on-line script (what a coincidence!).
