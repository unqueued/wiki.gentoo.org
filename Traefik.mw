Traefik provides a proxy that is container aware. 
This is a level 7 proxy, that is it operates in the application layer in the OSI model, that can only do connection termination.
One needs a level 4 proxy, that is it operate in the transport layer in the OSI model, to do connection routing as required by SSL-SNI for example.

Traefik will configure a virtual host for each container in ones container cluster (Mesos/docker/kubernetes and other supported), allowing it to serve from each container.
It will even go one further and issue SSL certificates for each service.

It may be run from within a container or upon the host. 
This article is concerned with the latter.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

E-Builds for traefik are presently supplied by the frabjous overlay.

=== USE flags ===

Traefik is a go based project and does not seem to need any specific use flags.

{{USEflag|package=net-proxy/traefik}}

=== Emerge ===

Traefik is readily emerged via the usual means once the overlay has been configured.

{{Emerge|net-proxy/frabjous}}

=== Additional software ===

Traefik is run as a compliment to ones container manager (Docker/Mesos).
One may configure it to be run as the web facing proxy if there are no host services or behind another proxy should one be serving content from their host aswell.
It can be integrated with analytics/monitoring packages e.g. promethues.

== Configuration ==

As traefik is quite modular it is easiest to copy the relevant pre-configured sections out of their documentation, stitching the parts together as necessary for ones own system.

=== Environment variables ===

* <var>VAR1</var>
* <var>VAR2</var>

=== Files ===

* {{Path|/etc/global_file_example}} - Global (system wide) configuration file.
* {{Path|~/.local_file_example}} - Local (per user) configuration file.

=== Service ===

(Provide instructions on starting/stopping and enabling/disabling the software's service. This is only really necessary if it if the software includes a daemon for certain tasks.)

Typically the service needs access to the docker socket, {Path|/var/run/docker.sock}, to generate configurations for the containers it proxies. 
Traefik should be really be started as root so that it can connect to the socket and then restrict it's own permissions to that of the Traefik user.
The present init script starts the service as the {user|traefik} user which prevents it from seeing the socket.
One may add Traefik to the docker group to enable this permission again.

{{Cmd|gpasswd -a traefik docker}}

==== OpenRC ====

One one has configured Traefik to their satisfaction they may add the service to the default service

{{Cmd|rc-update add traefik default}}

Subsequently start the service or restart the machine.

{{Cmd|rc-service traefik start}}

Use the following command to remove it from active duty.

{{Cmd|rc-update del traefik}}

==== runit ====

{{note|If you have information about invoking Traefik under runit please edit this section accordingly}}

==== systemd ====

{{note|If you have information about invoking Traefik under runit please edit this section accordingly}}

== Usage ==

While one is configuring Traefik it is convenient to run it directly. 

=== Invocation ===

Traefik may be run in debug mode directly, allowing one to watch it's responses to various requests.
The following command will invoke Traefik directly and view it's debug information as it pours onto ones console.

{{Cmd|traefik -d}}

One may use {{keys|ctrl+c}} to terminate this process.

== Troubleshooting ==

(Troubleshoot issues in this section. Separate issues by best describing the error with a new section name. Remove if no issues are known.)

=== Ignoring Frontend/backend configuration ===

Traefik is not told to explicitly watch it's own configuration file for frontend/backedn configuration(s).
This is resolved by simply adding the file heading into the configuration.

=== 404 ===

If traefik is hosted behind a proxy and the proxy is not forwarding the Host header then traefik cannot know which container to serve and returns a 404. To fix this ensure that one has correctly configured the proxy protocol in both the frontend proxy and the Traefik service itself.

== Removal ==

Removal of Traefik is as simple as unmerging the package, one may also wish to remove the overlay thereafter.

=== Unmerge ===

{{Unmerge|net-proxy/traefik}}
