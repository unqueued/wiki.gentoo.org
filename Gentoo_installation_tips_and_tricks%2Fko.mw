{{Metadata|abstract=젠투 설치는 다양한 설치 방법을 통한 상당히 유용한 접근법을 지향합니다. 설치 절차에서의 단일 요령에 대한 모든 내용을 넣는것은 거의  불가능하지만 이 문서에서는 참고 목적으로 제출한 요령을 다루려 할 것입니다.}}

The Gentoo installation allows for very flexible approaches to the various installation methods. As it is almost impossible to insert every single tip or trick in the installation instructions this document tries to deal with all submitted tips and tricks for reference purposes.


== 도입부 ==

=== 준비 ===

이 문서에는 젠투/x86 설치에 대한 여러가지 요령이 들어있습니다. 대부분 심도있게 다루었습니다 - 설치 절차에 대한 부록과 같은 의미이며, 내용을 대체하지는 않습니다. 

== 고급 설치 ==

=== 소프트웨어 RAID ===

{{Note/ko|소프트웨어 RAID에 익숙하지 않다면 [https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Linux_Raid Software-RAID-HOWTO]를 읽으십시오.}}

{{Note/ko|더 자세한 과정은 [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/gentoo-x86+raid+lvm2-quickinstall.xml 소프트웨어 RAID와 LVM2 x86 빠른 설치 안내서]에서 찾아보실 수 있습니다.}}

설치 CD로 부팅하고나면 알맞은 RAID 모듈을 불러오십시오. RAID-1을 사용하려 한다면: 

{{RoodCmd|modprobe raid1}}

디스크의 파티션을 나눌 때, 파티션에서 <code>83</code>(리눅스 네이티브 파티션) 대신<code>fd</code>(리눅스 RAID 자동 감지)를 사용하는지 확인하십시오. <code>fdisk</code>에서 <code>t</code> 명령으로 파티션 형식을 바꿀 수 있습니다. 

이제 RAID 어레이를 만들기 전에 메타장치 노드를 만들어야 합니다: 

{{RootCmd|mknod /dev/md1 b 9 1
|mknod /dev/md2 b 9 2
|mknod /dev/md3 b 9 3}}

파티션을 나누고 나면, [http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2002/12/05/RAID.html RAID 관리]용 고급 도구인 <code>mdadm</code>을 사용하여 {{Path|/etc/mdadm.conf}} 파일을 만드십시오. 예를 들어, {{Path|/dev/sda}}와 {{Path|/dev/sdb}}에 해당하는 부트, 스왑, 루트 파티션을 미러링(RAID-1) 하려면, 다음처럼 적을 수 있습니다: 

{{RootCmd|mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md1 --level{{=}}1 --raid-devices{{=}}2 --metadata{{=}}0.90 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
|mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md2 --level{{=}}1 --raid-devices{{=}}2 --metadata{{=}}0.90 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2
|mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md3 --level{{=}}1 --raid-devices{{=}}2 --metadata{{=}}0.90 /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb3}}

{{Important/ko|부팅하려는 파티션에 RAID-0이나 RAID-5 같은 형식을 사용하면 안됩니다. 또한, <code>--metadata{{=}}0.90</code>은 중요한 파일 시스템에만  필요합니다. 다른 파일 시스템에서는 좀 더 최신의 메타데이터 포맷을 사용합니다.}}

리눅스 소프트웨어 RAID 드라이버는 메타 장치 생성을 시작합니다. {{Path|/proc/mdstat}}에서 과정을 볼 수 있습니다. 진행 전에 메타 장치 생성이 끝날 때까지 기다리십시오. 

{{RootCmd|mdadm --detail --scan > /etc/mdadm.conf}}

이제부터 앞으로, {{Path|/dev/md1}}를 부트 파티션, {{Path|/dev/md2}}를 스왑 파티션, {{Path|/dev/md3}}를 루트 파티션으로 사용합니다. 

chroot를 수행하기 전에, {{Path|/etc/mdadm.conf}}를 {{Path|/mnt/gentoo/etc/}}에 복사하는 것을 잊지 마십시오. 

커널을 설정할 때, 적당한 RAID 지원을 커널에 모듈로서가 아니라 ''포함''했는지 확인하십시오. 

When installing extra tools, emerge <code>mdadm</code> as well. Note that this isn't available on all Installation CDs so you might not be able to install Gentoo on a Software RAID when using a networkless installation! 

When configuring your bootloader, make sure it gets installed in the MBR of ''both'' disks if you use mirroring. 

=== ATA RAID using 2.4 kernels ===

Make sure you boot your Installation CD using the <code>doataraid</code> option. Once booted, check the contents of {{Path|/dev/ataraid}} . It should contain various {{Path|disc*}} directories for each harddisk available in the ATA RAID. An entire disk is displayed as {{Path|disc}} while partitions are {{Path|part*}} . 

Write down the various {{Path|/dev/ataraid/disc*/*}} device files that you use to install Gentoo on. You will need to substitute the {{Path|/dev/sda}} examples in the installation with this path. 

Before chrooting, bind-mount the {{Path|/dev}} structure in the new environment: 

{{RootCmd|mount --rbind /dev /mnt/gentoo/dev}}

When configuring your kernel, make sure you enable support for your ATA RAID chipset and options. For instance, a popular ATA RAID system is a ''Promise FastTrack built-in RAID'' in which case you definitely need <code>Promise FastTrack Options</code> built in into your kernel. 

When configuring GRUB, you first have to create a GRUB bootdisk. This is not as hard as you think. First install GRUB as you would, but when you come to the part where GRUB is getting installed in the MBR, follow the following instructions: 

{{RootCmd|cd /boot/grub
|dd if{{=}}stage1 of{{=}}/dev/fd0 bs{{=}}512 count{{=}}1
|dd if{{=}}stage2 of{{=}}/dev/fd0 bs{{=}}512 seek{{=}}1}}

You still need to write your {{Path|grub.conf}} file. This is no different from the installation instructions, just make sure that your <code>root=</code> points to the ATA RAID device. 

After finishing the installation, boot with your GRUB bootdisk. You will be greeted by a GRUB prompt. Now configure GRUB to boot from the ATA RAID device: 

{{Cmd|root (hd0,x)|prompt=grub> 
|setup (hd0)
|quit}}

Now reboot (with the GRUB bootfloppy removed). 

LILO users can safely use the instructions mentioned in the installation instructions. 

=== 설치 CD 커널 사용하기 ===

If you don't want to compile a kernel yourself you can use the kernel from the Installation CD and copy it to your system. When you come to the point that you're asked to compile a kernel, go to another terminal (press Alt-F2) and log in with the root password you've supplied at the beginning of the installation. 

젠투 시스템에 커널과 모듈을 복사하십시오: 

{{Note/ko|${KN} 은 'gentoo'  또는 'smp' 같은 커널 이름입니다.}}

{{RootCmd|cp /mnt/cdrom/isolinux/${KN} /mnt/cdrom/isolinux/${KN}.igz /mnt/gentoo/boot
|mkdir -p /mnt/gentoo/lib/modules
|cp -Rp /lib/modules/`uname -r` /mnt/gentoo/lib/modules}}

To have all modules that are currently running (from the Installation CD) loaded during bootup of your Gentoo system, run the following command from within the chrooted environment: 

{{RootCmd|printf "modules\"" >> /etc/conf.d/modules
|cat /proc/modules | cut -d ' ' -f 1 >> /etc/conf.d/modules
|printf "\"\n" >> /etc/conf.d/modules}}

Verify the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/modules}} content and update appropriately. 

== 설치 단순화 ==

=== 터미널에서 나가기 ===

Many people want to leave their system when it's compiling. In certain cases this is rather difficult as the installation is done in a public environment where you cannot trust everyone. If this is the case, you want to be able to perform the compilation in the background and log out from all terminals. 

There are several possible solutions for this. The first one is to use <code>screen</code> . After booting the Installation CD, set your root password and start a screen session: 

{{Note|Not all Installation CDs provide screen. If this is the case, you will have to use one of the other methods described in this section.}}

{{RootCmd|screen -S gentoo}}

Once inside the screen session you can perform the entire installation. When you want to leave your terminal, press <code>Ctrl-a, d</code> (that is, control and a at the same time, then followed by a d) to ''detach'' your screen session. You can now safely log out of your system. 

To regain access to your terminal, log in as root again and ''attach'' to the running screen session: 

{{RootCmd|screen -x gentoo}}

If you can't use screen, there is still a way to leave your terminal. Follow the installation instructions, but when you come to the point where a long-term compilation would be started (for instance the <code>./scripts/bootstrap.sh</code> step), use <code>nohup</code> which allows for a process to continue even when you log out. Don't forget the trailing "&", otherwise the process won't be placed in the background! Remember where you are (the <code>pwd</code> command will show you that) as you will need to know this later on. 

{{RootCmd|pwd|output=<pre>
/usr/portage
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|nohup ./scripts/bootstrap.sh &}}

Now exit the chrooted environment ( <code>exit</code> ) and the Installation CD session. Your compilation will continue in the background. 

When you want to check the compilation, log in as root (on the Installation CD) and chroot back into your environment and go to the directory where you left off: 

{{RootCmd|chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash
|env-update && source /etc/profile
|cd /usr/portage}}

Now use the <code>less</code> command on the {{Path|nohup.out}} file that is situated inside that directory. The compilation will append its output to that file, so if you want to follow the compilation progress, run <code>less nohup.out</code> and press <code>F</code> to follow the changes. When the compilation is finished, you can continue with the next step of the installation instructions. 

If you ever get tired of following the changes, press <code>Ctrl-C</code> followed by a <code>q</code> . This won't stop the compilation process, only the <code>less</code> process. 

== Fixing Errors/Issues ==

=== Extensive Testing of your Disks ===

If you think your disk needs to be thoroughly checked for consistency (bad sectors and such), you can use the <code>-c</code> option while placing the ext2 or ext3 filesystem on it (using <code>mke2fs</code> ). This will format, perform a read-test and mark all bad blocks as such. If you are really paranoid, use <code>-c -c</code> to format your disk and perform an extensive read/write test. 

{{RootCmd|mke2fs -j -c /dev/sda3}}

=== Recovering from a malfunctioning installation ===

If for some reason your Gentoo installation fails, you don't have to redo the installation all over again. Instead, you can safely "go" to the point where you think you made a mistake (or where you think the instructions are flawed) and try a different approach. 

First of all you need to chroot back into your Gentoo Linux environment. Follow the instructions again, but ignore the partitioning steps as your partitions are already created and even populated. You can therefore immediately mount those partitions at {{Path|/mnt/gentoo}} . You should also ignore the steps about stage extraction and modifying {{Path|make.conf}} - you don't want to overwrite your files do you? 

Once chrooted inside your Gentoo Linux environment, immediately go to the step where you think you should try a different approach. Don't redo all the steps like bootstrapping and such unless that is the place where you think things went wrong. 

For instance, if you believe that you have a wrongly configured {{Path|grub.conf}} , you can immediately fire up your editor to update {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.conf}} . 

Once you have tried a different approach for your situation, you should consider how much of the subsequent steps you need to perform again. If the subsequent steps are depending on your change, you will need to redo those. 

For instance, 

* if you have changed a variable inside {{Path|make.conf}} you will need to do all subsequent compiling since those depend on the settings inside {{Path|make.conf}} 
* if you have altered {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.conf}} you can immediately exit the chrooted environment and reboot as no subsequent steps are depending on {{Path|grub.conf}} 
* if you have recompiled your kernel you only need to make sure that your bootloader configuration points to the correct kernel image (double-check that you mounted your {{Path|/boot}} !), then you can exit the chrooted environment and reboot
* if you have altered {{Path|/etc/fstab}} you can exit the chrooted environment and reboot

As you can see, for most recovery operations you can immediately reboot. Only in certain cases will you need to redo the subsequent installation steps.
