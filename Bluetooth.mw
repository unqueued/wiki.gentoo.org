This article describes the setup of '''bluetooth''' controllers.

== Installing ==

=== Prerequisites ===
Bluez ({{Package|net-wireless/bluez}}) uses [[udev]], so set it up first.

=== Kernel ===
You need [[USB]] and/or [[PC-Card]] support. Bluetooth device does not show in 'lsusb' if [[USB]] support not present. Also you need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
[*] Networking support  --->
    <*> Bluetooth subsystem support  --->
        
        Select options for Bluetooth applications, see table below:
        <*>   ...

            Bluetooth device drivers  --->

               Select a Bluetooth HCI driver, e.g.:
               <*> HCI USB driver (btusb)
</pre>}}

|-
| HIDP protocol support || hidp || Enables input device support. See the [[Bluetooth Input devices]] article.
|}

=== Software ===
Portage knows the global USE flag ''bluetooth'' for enabling support for Bluetooth in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}} automatically:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||
USE{{=}}"... bluetooth ..."
}}
The USE flags of bluez are:
{{USEflag|package=net-wireless/bluez
|alsa+yes
|cups+yes
|debug
|gstreamer
|pcmcia
|readline+yes
|selinux++no
|test-programs
|usb+yes
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Configuration ==

=== Boot service ===
You can now start bluetooth:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/bluetooth start}}
To start bluetooth at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add bluetooth default}}

=== Permissions ===
If you have the USE flag '''''acl''''' enabled globally and are using [[ConsoleKit]] (i.e you're using a ''desktop'' [[profile]]) permissions to bluetooth devices will be handled automatically.

A broader solution is to add the user you want to be able to access bluetooth devices to the ''plugdev'' group:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a larry plugdev}}

=== Adapter Information ===
Check that your bluetooth adapter is working.
{{Cmd|hcitool dev|output=<pre>
Devices:
	hci1	00:02:72:2F:A9:33
	hci0	60:D8:19:B6:C3:1F
</pre>}}
Where hci0 is the first device ID and 60:D8:19:B6:C3:1F is the MAC address.
{{Note|In this case there are two adapters but only one is required.}}
{{Note|If no adapters are found. Check that your bluetooth adapter is enabled. This may be a physical switch or keyboard function key. {{Package|net-wireless/rfkill}} is helpful for determining and setting the state of wireless adapters.}}

=== Bring interface up at bootup time ===
In case you need to use trusted bluetooth devices before a GUI is up and running, you can use an udev rule:
{{File|/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules||
# Set bluetooth power up
ACTION{{=}}{{=}}"add", KERNEL{{=}}{{=}}"hci0", RUN+{{=}}"/usr/bin/hciconfig hci0 up"
}}

== Usage ==
===BlueZ 4 ===
==== Device Attach/Pairing ====
Before a device can be used, it must be attached (''paired'' in Bluetooth-lingo). This is done by entering a PIN (or other code) on both devices.

{{Note|Some simple devices like headsets do not allow entering an arbitrary PIN, they always use the same one (usually 0000 or 9999). Check the manual of your device which is to be used.}}

In order to pair, you must first have the interaction agent active. Most desktop environments have bluetooth integration so will automatically support the interaction agent. For example, KDE has {{Package|net-wireless/bluedevil}}.

After an upgrade to BlueZ 5, pairing has to be redone.

==== Using simple-agent ====
Configuration can either be performed using the BlueZ test programs (available if you enable the test-programs USE flag for {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}}), or by using the D-Bus API. The first way is described here.


* Retrieve the address of the mouse. Most of the devices need you to press a special button, possibly for several seconds, to render them discoverable. 
{{Cmd|hcitool scan|output=<pre>
Scanning ...
	00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B	Bluetooth Laser Travel Mouse
</pre>}}
: Where 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B is the MAC address for your device.


* Pair the device:
{{Cmd|simple-agent hci0 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B|output=<pre>
RequestPinCode (/org/bluez/1664/hci0/dev_00_1F_20_1D_1B_4B)
Enter PIN Code: 0000
Release
New device (/org/bluez/1664/hci0/dev_00_1F_20_1D_1B_4B)
</pre>}}
: Enter a PIN and press {{Key|Enter}}, then enter the same PIN at the device. If you don't know the PIN, then it is probably 0000. It could be 1234.

{{Note|<br />
{{Cmd|simple-agent hci0 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B|output=<pre>
dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists: Already Exists
</pre>}}
: Means that you already have an interaction agent running on your system.}}


* Mark the device as trusted so it can connect automatically: 
{{Cmd|bluez-test-device trusted 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B yes}}


* Devices are not trusted by default. You can check trust status by leaving off the "yes" from the previous command.
{{Cmd|bluez-test-device trusted 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B|output=<pre>
1
</pre>}}
: "1" is trusted, "0" is not trusted.


* Connect the device (this only needs to be done once, it will be done automatically after that): 
{{Cmd|bluez-test-input connect 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B}}


* Your device should now be paired. You are now ready to proceed.


== Desktop integration ==
* {{Package|net-wireless/bluedevil}} for [[KDE]]
* {{Package|net-wireless/blueman}} for [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]], GTK+
