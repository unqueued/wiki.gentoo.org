This article describes the configuration and usage of Bluetooth controllers and devices.

== Prerequisites ==

This article assumes that [[udev]] and [[USB]] have been previously configured.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

In most cases enabling [[Wikipedia:List_of_Bluetooth_protocols#Radio_frequency_communication_.28RFCOMM.29|RFCOMM]], [[Wikipedia:List_of_Bluetooth_profiles#Human_Interface_Device_Profile_.28HID.29|HIDP]], [[Wikipedia:List_of_Bluetooth_protocols#Host_controller_interface_.28HCI.29|HCI]] USB and/or HCI UART should be sufficient. It is a good idea to enable the UHID (User-space Human Interface Device) driver for some bluetooth keyboards and mice to work.

=== USE flags ===

[http://www.bluez.org/ BlueZ] is an implementation of the Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux, and it is provided by the {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}} package.

{{USEflag|package=net-wireless/bluez}}

Bluetooth support can be enabled system-wide by setting the <var>USE</var> variable to <code>bluetooth</code>:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="bluetooth"
}}

=== Emerge ===

Portage will by default install BlueZ 5. If the deprecated BlueZ 4 is required, [[:/etc/portage/package.mask|mask]] BlueZ 5 to prevent it from being installed:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.mask|1=
>=net-wireless/bluez-5
}}

{{Important|Installing BlueZ 4, while Bluetooth support is enabled system-wide, may cause various dependency issues.}}

The system needs to be updated if the <var>USE</var> variable was set to <code>bluetooth</code>:

{{Emerge
|@world
|params+=--changed-use --deep
}}

Install BlueZ:

{{Emerge
|net-wireless/bluez
|params+=--noreplace
}}

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===

Permissions for Bluetooth devices will be handled automatically if the <var>USE</var> variable is set to <code>acl</code>, and [[ConsoleKit]] or [[systemd]] is being used.

Alternatively, adding a user to the {{c|plugdev}} group will allow that user to access Bluetooth devices:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <user> plugdev}}

=== Services ===

==== OpenRC ====

Start bluetooth:

{{RootCmd|rc-service bluetooth start}}

Start bluetooth at boot:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add bluetooth default}}

==== systemd ====

Start bluetooth:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start bluetooth}}

Start bluetooth at boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable bluetooth}}

== Usage ==

=== Controller setup ===

Display controller information:

{{RootCmd|hciconfig -a|output=<pre>
hci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB
        BD Address: 00:02:72:2F:A9:33  ACL MTU: 1021:8  SCO MTU: 64:1
        UP RUNNING PSCAN 
        RX bytes:1166 acl:0 sco:0 events:43 errors:0
        TX bytes:960 acl:0 sco:0 commands:43 errors:0
        Features: 0xbf 0xfe 0xcf 0xfe 0xdb 0xff 0x7b 0x87
        Packet type: DM1 DM3 DM5 DH1 DH3 DH5 HV1 HV2 HV3 
        Link policy: RSWITCH SNIFF 
        Link mode: SLAVE ACCEPT 
        Name: 'BlueZ 5.21'
        Class: 0x000104
        Service Classes: Unspecified
        Device Class: Computer, Desktop workstation
        HCI Version: 4.0 (0x6)  Revision: 0x1000
        LMP Version: 4.0 (0x6)  Subversion: 0x220e
        Manufacturer: Broadcom Corporation (15)
</pre>}}

Where <code>hci0</code> is the name of the controller, and <code>UP</code> indicates that the controller is enabled.

Enable the controller if {{c|hciconfig}} indicates (with <code>DOWN</code>) that the controller is disabled:

{{RootCmd|hciconfig hci0 up}}

When attempting to enable the controller, the following message may be displayed:

{{RootCmd|hciconfig hci0 up|output=<pre>
Can't init device hci0: Operation not possible due to RF-kill
</pre>}}

In this case, query the state of the Bluetooth radio transmitter with {{Package|net-wireless/rfkill}}:

{{RootCmd|rfkill list bluetooth|output=<pre>
0: hci0: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
</pre>}}

{{Note|If Bluetooth is blocked or disabled in the BIOS/UEFI, {{c|rfkill}} may incorrectly list the controller as <code>Hard blocked: no</code>.}}

Unblock the controller if {{c|rfkill}} indicates (with <code>Soft blocked: yes</code>) that the controller is blocked:

{{RootCmd|rfkill unblock bluetooth}}

If {{c|rfkill}} indicates (with <code>Hard blocked: yes</code>) that the controller is blocked, unblock the controller by physical switch or keyboard function key.

The following udev rule will enable a controller before a graphical desktop environment is up and running:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/90-bluetooth.rules|1=
# Enable the Bluetooth controller

# BlueZ 5
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="hci0", TEST=="/usr/bin/hciconfig", RUN+="/usr/bin/hciconfig hci0 up"
# BlueZ 4
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="hci0", TEST=="/usr/sbin/hciconfig", RUN+="/usr/sbin/hciconfig hci0 up"
}}

=== Device pairing ===

Bluetooth devices need to be paired with a Bluetooth controller before they can be used. This is done by entering a {{c|PIN}} (or other code) on both devices via an interaction agent. Certain devices such as headsets do not allow entering an arbitrary {{c|PIN}}. These devices use a static {{c|PIN}}, which is usually 0000, 1111, 1234 or 9999. There are also devices (e.g. [[Wikipedia:PlayStation_3_accessories#Blu-ray_Disc_Remote_Control|Sony BD Remote Control]]) that do not require {{c|PIN}} entry, and attempting to enter a {{c|PIN}} when prompted will result in failure. Paring can be skipped with such devices.

This article only covers device pairing with a command-line interaction agent. If a graphical desktop environment is being used, device paring can be done with a graphical interaction agent. For [[KDE]] use {{Package|net-wireless/bluedevil}}, for [[GNOME]] use {{Package|net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth}} and for GTK+ use {{Package|net-wireless/blueman}}.

==== BlueZ 5 ====

{{Note|Previously paired devices will need to be paired again when upgrading from BlueZ 4.}}

Device paring is done with {{c|bluetoothctl}}, which is provided by the {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}} package.

Start {{c|bluetoothctl}}:

{{Cmd|bluetoothctl}}

List the available controllers:

{{Cmd|list|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Display information about a controller:

{{Cmd|show ''controller_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Set the default controller:

{{Cmd|select ''controller_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Power on the controller:

{{Cmd|power on|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Enable the agent and set it as default:

{{Cmd
|agent on
|default-agent
|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue
}}

Set the controller as discoverable (temporarily for 3 minutes) and pairable:

{{Cmd
|discoverable on
|pairable on
|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue
}}

Scan for devices:

{{Cmd|scan on|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Put the device into pairing mode. This generally involves pressing a button or a combinations of buttons, usually for several seconds.

Discover the device MAC address:

{{Cmd|devices|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Pair with the device:

{{Cmd|pair ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Enter the {{c|PIN}} if prompted:

{{Cmd|PIN code: ####|prompt=[agent]|color=red}}

Allow the service authorization if requested:

{{Cmd|Authorize service ''service_uuid'' (yes/no): yes|prompt=[agent]|color=red}}

Trust the device:

{{Cmd|trust ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Connect to the device:

{{Cmd|connect ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Display information about the device:

{{Cmd|info ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

The device is now paired:

{{Cmd|quit|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

==== BlueZ 4 ====

{{Note|BlueZ 4 is deprecated and no longer supported by the BlueZ developers.}}

Device paring, which is done with {{c|simple-agent}}, requires the <var>USE</var> flag <code>test-programs</code> to be enabled for the {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}} package.

Put the device into pairing mode. This generally involves pressing a button or a combinations of buttons, usually for several seconds.

Discover the device MAC address:

{{Cmd|hcitool scan|output=<pre>
Scanning ...
        00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B       Bluetooth Device
</pre>}}

Where <code>00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B</code> is the MAC address of the device.

Pair with the device:

{{Cmd|simple-agent hci0 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B|output=<pre>
RequestPinCode (/org/bluez/1664/hci0/dev_00_1F_20_1D_1B_4B)
Enter PIN Code: 0000
Release
New device (/org/bluez/1664/hci0/dev_00_1F_20_1D_1B_4B)
</pre>}}

Enter a {{c|PIN}} and press {{Key|Enter}}. Now enter the same {{c|PIN}} on the device.

When attempting to pair with the device, the following message may be displayed if a graphical interaction agent is installed.

{{Cmd|simple-agent hci0 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B|output=<pre>
dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists: Already Exists
</pre>}}

In this case, stop or disable the graphical interaction agent and attempt to pair with the device again.

Query the trust status of the device:

{{Cmd|bluez-test-device trusted 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B|output=<pre>
0
</pre>}}

Where <code>0</code> indicates that the device is ''not'' trusted, and <code>1</code> would indicate that the device ''is'' trusted:

Trust the device so it can connect automatically:

{{Cmd|bluez-test-device trusted 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B yes}}

Connect to the device. This only needs to be done once if the device is trusted:

{{Cmd|bluez-test-input connect 00:1F:20:1D:1B:4B}}

The device is now paired.
