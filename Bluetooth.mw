This article describes the configuration and usage of Bluetooth controllers and devices.

== Prerequisites ==

This article assumes that [[udev]] and [[USB]] have been previously configured.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

In most cases enabling [[Wikipedia:List_of_Bluetooth_protocols#Radio_frequency_communication_.28RFCOMM.29|RFCOMM]], [[Wikipedia:List_of_Bluetooth_profiles#Human_Interface_Device_Profile_.28HID.29|HIDP]], [[Wikipedia:List_of_Bluetooth_protocols#Host_Controller_Interface_.28HCI.29|HCI]] USB and/or HCI UART should be sufficient. The User-space I/O driver for HID input devices should be enabled for Bluetooth keyboards and mice.

=== USE flags ===

[http://www.bluez.org/ BlueZ] is an implementation of the Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux, and it is provided by the {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}} package.

{{USEflag|package=net-wireless/bluez}}

Bluetooth support can be enabled system-wide by setting the <var>USE</var> variable to <code>bluetooth</code>:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="bluetooth"
}}

=== Emerge ===

The system needs to be updated if the <var>USE</var> variable was set to <code>bluetooth</code>:

{{Emerge
|@world
|params+=--changed-use --deep
}}

Install BlueZ:

{{Emerge
|net-wireless/bluez
|params+=--noreplace
}}

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===

Permissions for Bluetooth devices will be handled automatically if the <var>USE</var> variable is set to <code>acl</code>, and [[ConsoleKit]] or [[systemd]] is being used.

Alternatively, adding a user to the {{c|plugdev}} group will allow that user to access Bluetooth devices:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <user> plugdev}}

=== Services ===

==== OpenRC ====

Start bluetooth:

{{RootCmd|rc-service bluetooth start}}

Start bluetooth at boot:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add bluetooth default}}

==== systemd ====

Start bluetooth:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start bluetooth}}

Start bluetooth at boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable bluetooth}}

== Usage ==

=== Controller setup ===

Display controller information:

{{Note|{{c|hciconfig}} and other utilities are only available if {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}} is installed with the <code>deprecated</code> USE flag enabled.}}

{{RootCmd|hciconfig -a|output=<pre>
hci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB
        BD Address: 00:02:72:2F:A9:33  ACL MTU: 1021:8  SCO MTU: 64:1

        Manufacturer: Broadcom Corporation (15)
</pre>}}

Where <code>hci0</code> is the name of the controller, and <code>UP</code> (3rd line) indicates that the controller is enabled.

Enable the controller if {{c|hciconfig}} indicates (with <code>DOWN</code>) (3rd line) that the controller is disabled:

{{RootCmd|hciconfig hci0 up}}

{{Important|When attempting to enable the controller, the following message may be displayed: Can't init device hci0: Operation not possible due to RF-kill}}

In this case, query the state of the Bluetooth radio transmitter with {{c|rfkill}}:

{{RootCmd|rfkill list bluetooth|output=<pre>
0: hci0: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
</pre>}}

{{c|rfkill}} can be installed with the {{Package|net-wireless/rfkill}} package, or the >={{Package|sys-apps/util-linux}}-2.31 package.

{{Note|If Bluetooth is blocked or disabled in the BIOS/UEFI, {{c|rfkill}} may incorrectly list the controller as <code>Hard blocked: no</code>.}}

Unblock the controller if {{c|rfkill}} indicates (with <code>Soft blocked: yes</code>) that the controller is blocked:

{{RootCmd|rfkill unblock bluetooth}}

If {{c|rfkill}} indicates (with <code>Hard blocked: yes</code>) that the controller is blocked, unblock the controller by physical switch or keyboard function key.

Bluetooth controllers can be enabled automatically by setting <code>AutoEnable=true</code> in {{Path|/etc/bluetooth/main.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/bluetooth/main.conf|lang=ini|1=
[Policy]
AutoEnable=true
}}

In some instances Bluetooth controllers may have been soft-blocked by power management tools in udev. Make sure <var>state</var> is set to <code>1</code> in the corresponding rule file, or remove the following line entirely:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local-powersave.rules|1=
SUBSYSTEM=="rfkill", ATTR{type}=="bluetooth", ATTR{state}="1"
}}

=== Device pairing ===

Bluetooth devices need to be paired with a Bluetooth controller before they can be used. This is done by entering a PIN (or other code) on both devices via an interaction agent. Certain devices such as headsets do not allow entering an arbitrary PIN. These devices use a static PIN, which is usually 0000, 1111, 1234 or 9999. There are also devices (e.g. [[Wikipedia:PlayStation_3_accessories#Blu-ray_Disc_Remote_Control|Sony BD Remote Control]]) that do not require PIN entry, and attempting to enter a PIN when prompted will result in failure. Paring can be skipped with such devices.

This article only covers device pairing with {{c|bluetoothctl}}, which is a command-line interaction agent provided by the {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}} package. If a graphical desktop environment is being used, device paring can be done with a graphical interaction agent. For [[KDE]] use {{Package|kde-plasma/bluedevil}}, for [[GNOME]] use {{Package|net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth}}, and for GTK+ use {{Package|net-wireless/blueman}}.

{{Note|Previously paired devices will need to be paired again when upgrading from BlueZ 4.}}

Start {{c|bluetoothctl}}:

{{Cmd|bluetoothctl}}

List the available controllers:

{{Cmd|list|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Display information about a controller:

{{Cmd|show ''controller_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Set the default controller:

{{Cmd|select ''controller_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Power on the controller:

{{Cmd|power on|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Enable the agent and set it as default:

{{Cmd
|agent on
|default-agent
|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue
}}

Set the controller as discoverable (temporarily for 3 minutes) and pairable:

{{Cmd
|discoverable on
|pairable on
|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue
}}

Scan for devices:

{{Cmd|scan on|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Put the device into pairing mode. This generally involves pressing a button or a combinations of buttons, usually for several seconds.

Discover the device MAC address:

{{Cmd|devices|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Pair with the device:

{{Cmd|pair ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Enter the {{c|PIN}} if prompted:

{{Cmd|PIN code: ####|prompt=[agent]|color=red}}

Allow the service authorization if requested:

{{Cmd|Authorize service ''service_uuid'' (yes/no): yes|prompt=[agent]|color=red}}

Trust the device:

{{Cmd|trust ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Connect to the device:

{{Cmd|connect ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

Display information about the device:

{{Cmd|info ''device_mac_address''|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}

The device is now paired:

{{Cmd|quit|prompt=[bluetooth]#|color=lightblue}}
