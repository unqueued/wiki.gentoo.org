The '''Manifest''' is a file containing checksums for files in the ebuild directory.

== File format ==

The Manifest2 file is a plain text file. Each line of the file has the following format:

 ''<type> <filename> <size> <hash-type> <hash>'' [''<hash-type> <hash>'' ...]

;type
: The type of the particular file. This could be:

:;EBUILD
:: An ebuild file
:;MISC
:: Another file in the ebuild directory
:;AUX
:: A file in the files/ subdirectory
:;DIST
:: A distfile â€” a file fetched as sources by the ebuild

;filename
: The name of the file.

;size
: The size of the file as decimal number, in bytes.

;hash-type
: The type of hash in the following field.

;hash
: The checksum of the file as hexadecimal number, of type specified by ''<hash-type>''.

== Hash types ==

The hashes currently supported by portage are:

* <tt>MD5</tt>,
* <tt>SHA1</tt>,
* <tt>SHA256</tt> (SHA-2),
* <tt>SHA512</tt> (SHA-2),
* <tt>RMD160</tt> (RIPEMD),
* <tt>WHIRLPOOL</tt>.

As of Jul 3rd, 2012 hashes currently used in gentoo repository are: RMD160, SHA1 and SHA256.

On Jul 4th, 2012 the used hashes will change to: SHA1, SHA256 and WHIRLPOOL (source: [http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev-announce/msg_00000.xml gentoo-dev-announce: New Manifest hashes]).
