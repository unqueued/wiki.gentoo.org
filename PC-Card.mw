This article describes the setup of ''PC-Card'' (also known as PCMCIA) controllers.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel Configuration ===
The following kernel options must be activated for PCMCIA controllers:
{{KernelBox|<pre>
Bus options (PCI etc.)  --->
    PCCard (PCMCIA/CardBus) support  --->
        <*>   16-bit PCMCIA support
        [*]     Load CIS updates from userspace (EXPERIMENTAL)
        [*]   32-bit CardBus support

        Select a socket driver, e.g.:
        [*]   CardBus yenta-compatible bridge support (yenta-socket)
</pre>}}

=== Portage Configuration ===
Portage knows the global '''USE''' flag <code>pcmcia</code> for enabling support for PC-Cards in other packages. Enabling this '''USE''' flag will pull in {{Package|sys-apps/pcmciautils}} automatically:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="... pcmcia ..."
}}
After setting the '''USE''' flag in the step above be sure to update the system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

To install pcmciautils manually (if it is not already pulled in):
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/pcmciautils
|debug
|staticsocket
}}
{{Emerge|pcmciautils}}

=== Software Configuration===
==== Card Information Structure ====
A ''PC-Card'' has a firmware called '''Card Information Structure''' (CIS). Some CISs are flawed, but can be patched at boot time. For those types of cards install {{Package|sys-apps/pcmcia-cs-cis}}:
{{Emerge|pcmcia-cs-cis}}

==== Resource database ====
Some old 16-bit ''PCMCIA'' cards works only if a resource database is set up. This effects only some x86 and x86_64 computers; not all are effected. To find out if the database is needed look at the controllers PCI-ID. [[Hardware detection#lspci|The lspci tool]] works nicely for this task:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} egrep --color -i "pcmcia{{!}}cardbus"
|output= '''03''':01.0 CardBus bridge: O2 Micro, Inc. Cardbus bridge (rev 21)}}
If the first two numbers are not zeros (here in bold: 03), then no resource database is needed. If they are zeros, then the database will need copied to {{Path|/etc/pcmcia/config.opts}}:
{{RootCmd|cd /usr/portage/sys-apps/pcmciautils
|ebuid pcmciautils-017.ebuild unpack
|cp -p /var/tmp/portage/sys-apps/pcmciautils-017/work/pcmciautils-017/config/config.opts /etc/pcmcia/
}}
Edit the file as needed.

== Usage ==
The <kbd>pccardctl</kbd> command (part of the {{Package|sys-apps/pcmciautils}} package) can be used to show information about the PC-Card controller and the inserted cards. It can also be used to load and unload PC cards.
