An ebuild file is a text file, used by Gentoo package managers, which identify a specific software package and how the Gentoo package manager should handle it. It uses a bash-like syntax style and is standardized through the [[EAPI]] version.

Gentoo Linux uses ebuilds as the package management format for individual software titles. These ebuilds contain metadata about the software (what is the name and version of the software, which license does it use, what is its home page), dependency information (both build-time as well as run-time dependencies) and instructions on how to deal with the software (configure, build, install, test ...).
