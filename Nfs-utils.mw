===Linux===
Verify if NFS version 4 is enabled in current running linux kernel.

{{RootCmd|cd /usr/src/linux}}
{{RootCmd|make nconfig}}

{{Kernel||<pre>
File systems  --->
   Network File Systems  --->
      <*>   NFS client support
      [*]     NFS client support for NFS version 4
      <*>   NFS server support
      [*]     NFS server support for NFS version 4 (EXPERIMENTAL)
</pre>
}}
{{Note|NFS server support is not needed on a NFS client installation, also NFS client support is not necessarily needed on a NFS server.}}
Optionally NFSv4 support could be build as a kernel module. After NFSv4 support has been enabled, new linux kernel needs to be build, installed and the system has to be restarted.

== USE flags ==
The following USE flags are supported by {{Package|net-fs/nfs-utils}} package:
{{USEflag
|package=net-fs/nfs-utils
|elibc_glibc
|nfsv3
|nfsv4++yes
|tcpd+yes
|caps
|ipv6+yes 
|kerberos
}}

==Installation==
{{emerge|net-fs/nfs-utils}}

==Configuration ==

===Server===
A virtual root needs to be created. All local NFS shares will be exported from that particular directory.
{{RootCmd|cd /}}
{{RootCmd|mkdir export}}
You can substitute the name and the location of the virtual root (here: {{Path|/export}}), with anything else f.e. {{Path|/nfsroot}} or {{Path|/home/NFSv4root}}.

Additionally following configuration files need to be edited:
* {{Path|/etc/exports}}
* {{Path|/etc/hosts.allow}}
* {{Path|/etc/hosts.deny}}

The {{Path|/etc/exports}} file has generally following structure
{{File|/etc/exports||<pre>
directory machine1(option11,option12)
machine2(option21,option22)
</pre>
}}
