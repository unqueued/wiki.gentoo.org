===Linux===
Verify if NFS version 4 is enabled in current running linux kernel.

{{RootCmd|cd /usr/src/linux}}
{{RootCmd|make nconfig}}

{{Kernel||<pre>
File systems  --->
   Network File Systems  --->
      <*>   NFS client support
      [*]     NFS client support for NFS version 4
      <*>   NFS server support
      [*]     NFS server support for NFS version 4 (EXPERIMENTAL)
</pre>
}}
{{Note|NFS server support is not needed on a NFS client installation, also NFS client support is not necessarily needed on a NFS server.}}
Optionally NFSv4 support could be build as a kernel module. After NFSv4 support has been enabled, new linux kernel needs to be build, installed and the system has to be restarted.
