Network File System (NFS) is a file system protocol that allows client machines to access network attached filesystems. The newest version is version 4.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

NFS server support is not required for NFS clients, and NFS client support is not required for NFS servers. Dnotify support is only required for NFSv4. NFSv3 is only required for compatibility with legacy clients e.g. the BusyBox mount command does not support NFSv4.

== Configuration ==

=== Server ===

The following table describes the filesystems that will be exported by the server:

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|-
! Device
! Mount directory
! Description
|-
| {{Path|/dev/sdb1}}
| {{Path|/home}}
| Filesystem containing user home directories.
|-
| {{Path|/dev/sdc1}}
| {{Path|/data}}
| Filesystem containing user data.
|}

==== Virtual root ====

The filesystems to be exported must be made available under a single directory. This directory is known as the virtual root directory, and it is required for NFSv4:

{{RootCmd|mkdir /export}}

{{Note|The {{Path|/export}} directory is used throughout this article as the virtual root directory, although any directory can be used e.g. {{Path|/nfs}} or {{Path|/srv/nfs}}}}

Create directories in the virtual root directory for the filesystems (e.g. {{Path|/home}} and {{Path|/data}}) that are to be exported:

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /export/home
|mkdir /export/data
}}

The filesystems to be exported need to be made available under their respective directories in the virtual root directory. This is accomplished with the  <code>--bind</code> option of the {{c|mount}} command:

{{RootCmd
|mount --bind /home /export/home
|mount --bind /data /export/data
}}

To make the above mounts persistent, add the following to {{Path|/etc/[[fstab]]}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
/home    /export/home    none    bind    0    0
/data    /export/data    none    bind    0    0
}}

==== Exports ====

The filesystems to be made accessible for clients are specified in {{Path|/etc/exports}}. This file consists of the directories to be exported, the clients allowed to access those directories, and a list options for each client. Refer to {{c|man exports}} for more information about the NFS export configuration options:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/exports|1=
/export         192.168.0.0/24(insecure,rw,sync,no_subtree_check,crossmnt,fsid=0)
/export/home    192.168.0.0/24(insecure,rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
/export/data    192.168.0.0/24(insecure,rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
}}

The above configuration grants access to the exported directories by IP network, in this case <code>192.168.0.0/24</code>. Client access can also be specified as a single host (IP address or fully qualified domain name), NIS netgroup, or with a single <code>*</code> character which grants all clients access.

The following table briefly describes the client options used in the configuration above:

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|-
! Option
! Description
|-
| <code>insecure</code>
| The server will require that client requests originate on unprivileged ports (those above 1024). This option is required when mounting exported directories from OS X or by the {{Path|nfs:/}} kioslave in KDE. The default is to use privileged ports.
|-
| <code>rw</code>
| The client will have read and write access to the exported directory. The default is to allow read-only access.
|-
| <code>sync</code>
| The server must wait until filesystem changes are committed to storage before responding to further client requests. This is the default.
|-
| <code>no_subtree_check</code>
| The server will not verify that a file requested by a client is in the appropriate filesystem and exported tree. This is the default.
|-
| <code>crossmnt</code>
| The server will reveal filesystems that are mounted under the virtual root directory that would otherwise be hidden when a client mounts the virtual root directory.
|-
| <code>fsid=0</code>
| This option is required to uniquely identify the virtual root directory.
|}

If changes are made to {{Path|/etc/exports}} after the NFS server has started, issue the following command to propagate the changes to clients:

{{RootCmd|exportfs -rv}}

==== Daemon ====

The NFS daemon is configured via {{Path|/etc/conf.d/nfs}}:

For OpenRC the Variable is called OPTS_RPC_NFSD:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/nfs|lang=bash|1=
OPTS_RPC_NFSD="8 -N 2 -V 3 -V 4 -V 4.1"
}}
For systemd the Variable is called RPCNFSDARGS:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/nfs|lang=bash|1=
RPCNFSDARGS="8 -N 2 -V 3 -V 4 -V 4.1"
}}

The option <code>8</code> is the number of NFS server threads to start. Since only one thread is started by default, the thread count should be increased for optimal performance. The option <code>-N 2</code> disables NFS version 2, while options <code>-V 3</code>, <code>-V 4</code> and <code>-V 4.1</code> enable NFS versions 3,4 and 4.1. Refer to {{c|man nfsd}} for more information about the NFS daemon configuration options.

==== Service ====

'''OpenRC'''

To start the NFS server:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/nfs start|output=<pre>
 * Starting rpcbind ...                                                   [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS statd ...                                                 [ ok ]
 * Starting idmapd ...                                                    [ ok ]
 * Exporting NFS directories ...                                          [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS mountd ...                                                [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS daemon ...                                                [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS smnotify ...                                              [ ok ]
</pre>}}

The above output shows that many other services are also started along with the {{c|nfs}} service. To stop all NFS services, stop the {{c|rpcbind}} service:

{{RootCmd|rc-service rpcbind stop}}

To start the NFS server at boot:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add nfs default}}

'''systemd'''

To start the NFS server:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start rpcbind nfs-server}}

To start the NFS server at boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable rpcbind nfs-server}}

=== Client ===

==== Service ====

'''OpenRC'''

To be able to mount exported directories, start the NFS client:

{{RootCmd|rc-service nfsclient start|output=<pre>
 * Starting rpcbind                                                       [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS statd                                                     [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS sm-notify                                                 [ ok ]
</pre>}}

To start the NFS client at boot:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add nfsclient default}}

'''systemd'''

The {{c|nfs-client}} service will be started automatically when systemd detects that exported directories are being mounted.

==== Mounting exports ====

{{Note|The commands and configuration files below use the IP address <code>192.168.0.1</code> to represent the NFS server.}}

Mount the exported directories:

{{RootCmd
|mount 192.168.0.1:/home /home
|mount 192.168.0.1:/data /data
}}

To make the above mounts persistent, add the following to {{Path|/etc/fstab}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
192.168.0.1:/home    /home    nfs    rw,_netdev    0    0
192.168.0.1:/data    /data    nfs    rw,_netdev    0    0
}}

The virtual root directory can be mounted instead of each individual exported directory. This will make all exported directories available to the client:

{{RootCmd|mount 192.168.0.1:/ /mnt}}

To make the above mount persistent, add the following to {{Path|/etc/fstab}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
192.168.0.1:/        /mnt     nfs    rw,_netdev    0    0
}}

When using {{Path|/etc/fstab}} to mount the exported directories, add the {{c|netmount}} service to the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add netmount default}}

If the NFS server or client support NFSv3 only, the ''full'' path to the exported directory (e.g. {{Path|/export/home}} or {{Path|/export/data}}) needs to be specified when mounting:

{{RootCmd
|mount 192.168.0.1:/export/home /home
|mount 192.168.0.1:/export/data /data
}}

The same applies when mounting the virtual root directory:

{{RootCmd|mount 192.168.0.1:/export /mnt}}

When mounting exported directories on an IPv6 network, enclose the IPv6 NFS server address in square brackets:

{{RootCmd
|mount [2001::215:c5ff:fb3e:e2b1]:/home /home
|mount [2001::215:c5ff:fb3e:e2b1]:/data /data
}}

When mounting a link-local IPv6 address, the network interface must also be specified:

{{RootCmd
|mount [fe80::215:c5ff:fb3e:e2b1%eth0]:/home /home
|mount [fe80::215:c5ff:fb3e:e2b1%eth0]:/data /data
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

<!-- If you make any changes to this section, please consider changing the appropriate section in [[CIFS]] as well. -->

* The system may become unresponsive during shutdown when the NFS client attempts to unmount exported directories ''after'' [[udev]] has stopped. To prevent this issue, a [[local.d]] script can be used to forcibly unmount the exported directories during shutdown:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/nfs.stop|1=
/bin/umount -a -f -t nfs,nfs4
}}

{{RootCmd|chmod a+x /etc/local.d/nfs.stop}}

* Verify that the NFS server is running and listening for connections:

{{RootCmd|netstat -tupan {{!}} egrep 'rpc{{!}}Active{{!}}Proto'|output=<pre>
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

</pre>}}

* Verify which NFS daemons are running:

{{RootCmd|rpcinfo -p|output=<pre>
   program vers proto   port  service
    100000    4   tcp    111  portmapper

    100000    4   udp    111  portmapper
    100000    3   udp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100024    1   udp  57655  status

    100021    3   tcp  44043  nlockmgr
    100021    4   tcp  44043  nlockmgr
</pre>}}

* List the exported directories from the NFS server:

{{RootCmd|exportfs -v|output=<pre>
/export       	192.168.0.0/24(rw,wdelay,crossmnt,insecure,root_squash,no_subtree_check,fsid=0,sec=sys,no_all_squash)
/export/home  	192.168.0.0/24(rw,wdelay,insecure,root_squash,no_subtree_check,sec=sys,no_all_squash)
/export/data  	192.168.0.0/24(rw,wdelay,insecure,root_squash,no_subtree_check,sec=sys,no_all_squash)
</pre>}}

* List the current open connections to the NFS server:

{{Cmd|netstat -tn {{!}} egrep '2049{{!}}Active{{!}}Proto'|output=<pre>
Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State

</pre>}}

* Verify that the exported directories are mounted by the NFS client:

{{Cmd|netstat -tn {{!}} egrep '2049{{!}}Active{{!}}Proto'|output=<pre>
Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
