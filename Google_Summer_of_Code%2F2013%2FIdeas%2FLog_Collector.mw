==== Log collector/analyzer for tinderbox build logs ====
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Flameeyes's tinderbox has been using a custom, spit-and-chewingum log collector and analyzer written in Ruby for a while. A replacement is dearly needed.

The ideal software would be a daemon service that receives build logs from Portage, both for storage in full and for metadata extraction (package name, maintainers, type of failure if any, emerge --info output, ...), and then provide a (password-protected) web interface that allows to read the failing logs, and open bugs at Gentoo's Bugzilla.

Bonus points for:

* being completely standalone (current setup depends on Amazon's S3);
* attaching logs instead of just linking them (size limits could make it hard to achieve);
* searching for the list of already open bugs for the failing package;
* proper integration with Portage so that no extra software is required on the tinderbox side to push the logs;
* standard, HTTP-based protocol between the tinderbox and the collector, which can be proxied through Squid;
* being written in Python to reduce the language fragmentation (current setup is written in Shell and Ruby).
