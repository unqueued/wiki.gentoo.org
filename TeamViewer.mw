TeamViewer is a proprietary (closed source), all-in-one solution for remote access and support over the Internet. It has both a client and a server mode and requires either a built-in or system [[Wine]].

== Installation ==

Be aware there are a few versions of TeamViewer available in the main Gentoo repository.

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-misc/teamviewer}}

=== Emerge ===

Be aware it is necessary to accept TeamViewer's End User License Agreement (EULA) before the software can be installed.

{{Emerge|net-misc/teamviewer}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

Supposing TeamViewer 11 has been installed, the configuration files would be found in the following locations:

* {{Path|/etc/teamviewer11/global.conf}} - Global (system wide) configuration file.
* {{Path|~/.config/teamviewer11/}} - Local (per user) configuration file.

=== Service ===

The TeamViewer daemon must be started before using the TeamViewer front-end. Those who want TeamViewer to be running every time they boot their system will need to add it the list of services that run during system start.

==== OpenRC ====

Start TeamViewer 11 during system start:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add teamviewerd11 default}}

Start the TeamViewer 11 daemon now:

{{RootCmd|rc-service teamviewerd11 start}}

==== systemd ====

Start TeamViewer 11 during system start:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable teamviewerd11}}

Start the TeamViewer 11 daemon now:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start teamviewerd11}}

== Usage ==

=== Invocation ===

After the service has been started, simply start TeamViewer from the Applications menu in a desktop environment. Those using a command line can start it via:

{{Cmd|teamviewer11}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Connection to server freezes during "Initializing display parameters" ===

There is a know issue (see {{Bug|552016}}) that causes the connection to the server to halt. The client will display "Initializing display parameters" but never make it past this step in the connection process.

This issue can be resolved by remerging TeamViewer with the <code>system-wine</code> USE flag disabled:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|1=
net-misc/teamviewer -system-wine
}}

{{Emerge|params+=--deep --newuse|@world}}

== Removal ==

=== Files ===

In order to scrub all traces of TeamViewer from the system each user's {{Path|~/.config/teamviewer11}} folder should be removed:

{{Cmd|rm -rf ~/.config/teamviewer*}}

=== Unmerge ===

{{Unmerge|net-misc/teamviewer}}
