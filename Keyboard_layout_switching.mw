Keyboard layout maps scancodes from a keyboard into characters sent to application. Keyboard layout can also do more complex transformations via so called dead keys which do not output characters on their own but modify output of subsequent keys. An appropriate keyboard layout is required to support both non-QWERTY keyboards as well as QWERTY keyboards used to enter characters outside of ASCII set.

== Terminal ==
=== OpenRC ===
Edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/keymaps}} which is documented but not very understandable. It appears that one should choose appropriate keyboard map likely from {{Path|/usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/}} as the value for ''keymap'' and then optionally also pick files from appropriate include directory such as {{Path|/usr/share/keymaps/i386/include/}} other locations might or might not work as values for the ''extended_keymaps'' variable.
{{File|/etc/conf.d/keymaps|Example configuration|<pre>
keymap="us"
extended_keymaps=""
</pre>}}
Lastly add {{Path|/etc/init.d/keymaps}} to the boot run level.
{{RootCmd|rc-update add keymaps boot}}
{{Note|It might be necessary to also edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/consolefont}} to have tty show non-ASCII characters.}}
=== systemd ===
Systemd uses {{Path|/etc/vconsole.conf}} and includes both tty font and keyboard layout settings but lacks advanced settings found in OpenRC. Valid values should match what OpenRC supports for the corresponding variable.
{{File|/etc/vconsole.conf|Example systemd configuration from the systemd article|<pre>
KEYMAP=pl2
FONT=LatArCyrHeb-16
</pre>}}
== X11 ==
Modern X11 applications usually use libXklavier (das Klavier being German for keyboard so it has nothing to do with a certain K DE) and can be configured by using '''setxkbmap'''. Furthermore X11 supports much broader set of keyboard layouts than virtual terminal. It should be kept in mind that proper desktop environment will do its own keyboard layout management and there's no need to directly use aforementioned application but it can come in handy when dealing with broken or lacking keyboard layout management.
=== KDE4 ===
Open '''System Settings''' and navigate to '''Input Devices''' module.
=== Generic desktop environment ===
Edit {{Path|~/.xprofile}} and call setxkbmap from there.
{{Note|Recent versions of GNOME 3 do not use libXklavier anymore therefore this might not work at all or likely get overriden by GNOME. Similarly any other desktop environment might also override libXklavier configuration as part of initialization or layout change.}}
{{Warning|{{Path|~/.xprofile}} is a non-standard file that's sourced only when logging in via display manager that supports it (possibly only GDM, KDM and LXDM) and it might be distribution specific although all common distributions seem to support this file.}}

=== Generic X11 ===
Querying existing configuration.
{{Cmd|setxkbmap -query}}
Setting a keyboard layout.
{{Cmd|setxkbmap lv}}
Setting a keyboard layout and its variant.
{{Cmd|setxkbmap lv apostrophe}}
Finding the supported layouts and variants or values of other xkb properties does not appear to be possible with this application and the only generic way to determine supported values is by examining {{Path|/usr/share/X11/xkb/}}. For sake of sanity use of a proper desktop environment with its own keyboard layout management is advised.
