An '''input method''' is a way to use any data as input, for example to use a standard Latin keyboard for writing Chinese characters. Gentoo has several input method frameworks available:

* [[ATOKX]] — Japanese
* [[fcitx]] — supporting multiple languages and IMEs, mostly for Simplified Chinese, but also other scripts
* [[IBus]] — supporting multiple languages and IMEs
* [[SCIM]] — supporting multiple languages and IMEs
* [[uim]] — supporting multiple languages and IMEs

The gentoo-zh overlay includes some more packages (and not just for Chinese).
