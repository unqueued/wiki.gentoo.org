This guide details running X server under user account.

It was only tested under nouveau, but all kms driver should work.

== Additional prerequisities ==
Some of this support is pretty fresh so one definitely needs to install unstable packages

{{File|/etc/portage/package.keywords||<pre>
x11-base/xorg-server **
x11-base/xorg-drivers **
x11-drivers/xf86-input-keyboard **
x11-drivers/xf86-input-mouse **
x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev **
x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau **
</pre>}}

Also depending on driver support there may be need to install development packages from x11 overlay.
For example xf86-video-nouveau doesn't have any version with necessary changes so -9999 package is needed.

== Rebuilding Xorg ==

Disable suid USE flag:
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use||<pre>
x11-base/xorg-server -suid
</pre>}}

Rebuild Xorg
{{RootCmd|emerge -uDNav xorg-server}}

== Making necessary changes to system ==

Now you can run X as user, however because none of login managers are capable yet of doing necessary permision handling it needs some workarounds.
In particular, X run by user needs to be able to access /dev/input files and it needs to be started manually.

To access /dev/input files it's easiest to add them to group and allow user to access them.

{{RootCmd|groupadd input}}
{{RootCmd|usermod -a -G input user}}

Create udev rule to change /dev/input group on boot:
{{File|/etc/udev/rules.d/99-dev-input-group.rules||<pre>
SUBSYSTEM=="input", ACTION=="add", GROUP="input"
</pre>}}

Reboot so file have correct permissions.

If logged on tty1 use vt1, on tty2 use vt2, and so on

{{Cmd|startx -- vt1}}

X should now run as user.
