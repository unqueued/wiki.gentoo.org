The '''Package Manager Specification (PMS)''' is a standardization effort to ensure that the [[Ebuild|ebuild]] file format, the ebuild repository format (of which the Portage tree is Gentoo's main incarnation), as well as behavior of the package managers interacting with these ebuilds is properly written down and agreed upon.

By defining the ebuild format and package managers behavior, it is possible for software developers to create other package managers next to Portage that are fully compatible with the ebuilds and can be used on Gentoo (and related) distributions.

For more information, see Gentoo's [[Project:Package Manager Specification|Package Manager Specification project]].
