The [[Raspberry Pi]] cannot run a vanilla Linux kernel. A patched version of the kernel is maintained by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and is available from their GitHub page, https://github.com/raspberrypi

== Prerequisites ==
To compile a kernel, you require {{Package|dev-vcs/git}} to download the source code and [[genkernel]] to manage the build process. 
{{Emerge|git genkernel}}

== Get the Kernel Source ==
{{RootCmd|cd /opt
|git clone --depth 1 <nowiki>git://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git</nowiki>
|ln -s /opt/linux /usr/src/linux}}

== Compile and Install the Kernel ==
{{Note|Compiling will take about 6 hours.}}
Using genkernel you can build a Linux kernel with support for many different features. Follow one of the examples below that has the features that you require. 

=== Default Kernel ===
In this example the configuration options from the running kernel are used to compile the new kernel. 
{{RootCmd|genkernel --kernel-config{{=}}/proc/config.gz kernel}}
After the kernel has compiled it will be installed into the {{Path|/boot}} folder. 

=== Kernel with initramfs ===
This example will run menuconfig before compiling the kernel, allowing you to enable any extra modules you may need.
Using a kernel with an [[initramfs]] allows you to load modules, decrypt partitions and other more complex task that maybe require early in the boot process. 
{{RootCmd|genkernel --kernname{{=}}rpi --menuconfig all}}
To support initramfs the following options need to be enabled in menuconfig.
{{KernelBox|1=
General setup  --->       
    [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
        ()    Initramfs source file(s) (NEW)
        [*]   Support initial ramdisks compressed using gzip (NEW)
        [ ]   Support initial ramdisks compressed using bzip2 (NEW)
}}

After the kernel has compiled it and the initramfs be installed into the {{Path|/boot}} folder.

== Adding New Kernel to Bootloader ==
By default the Raspberry Pi looks for a kernel in {{Path|/boot/kernel.img}}. This is changed in the configuration file {{Path|/boot/config.txt}} to load the new kernel. 
{{FileBox|filename=/boot/config.txt|title=Example config.txt|1=
kernel=kernel-genkernel-arm-3.2.27+
}}

If using an initramfs you also need to add that to the {{Path|config.txt}}.
{{FileBox|filename=/boot/config.txt|title=Example config.txt with an initramfs|1=
kernel=kernel-rpi-arm-3.2.27+
initramfs initramfs-rpi-arm-3.2.27+ 
}}

Now the Raspberry Pi can be rebooted and should make use of the new kernel. If for some reason the new kernel does not load or gives errors, the kernel entry in the {{Path|/boot/config.txt}} can be removed. Then on the next reboot the default {{Path|kernel.img}} will be loaded.
