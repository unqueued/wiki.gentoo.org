=Gentoo Chroot Setup Guide=
==What Is A Chroot?==
Chroot (Change Root) is a Unix system utility used to change the apparent root directory to create a new environment logically separate from the main system. This new environment is known as a "chroot jail". A user operating inside the jail can not see or access files outside of the environment they have been locked into.

One of the main uses for chrooting is to create a separate Linux system on top of a the current one for the purpose of testing or software compatibility. It is often seen as a lightweight alternative to Virtualization because it is able to run without the overhead of a hypervisor.

===Setting Up The Environment===
The first thing that you need to do is create a directory for your chroot to reside, for example in "/mnt/mychroot"

{{Cmd|mkdir /mnt/mychroot|}}
{{Cmd|cd /mnt/mychroot|}}

===Unpacking System Files & Portage===
The next step is to download a the stage3 and portage tarballs and set them up in the chroot location. For more information on this process please see sections 5a and 5b in the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=1&chap=5 Gentoo Handbook].
