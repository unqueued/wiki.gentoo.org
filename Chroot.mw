==What is a chroot?==
Chroot (Change Root) is a Unix system utility used to change the apparent root directory to create a new environment logically separate from the main system. This new environment is known as a "chroot jail". A user operating inside the jail can not see or access files outside of the environment they have been locked into.

One of the main uses for chrooting is to create a separate Linux system on top of a the current one for the purpose of testing or software compatibility. It is often seen as a lightweight alternative to virtualization because it is able to run without the overhead of a hypervisor.

==Setting up the environment==
The first thing that you need to do is create a directory for your chroot to reside, for example in "/mnt/mychroot"

{{Cmd|mkdir /mnt/mychroot|}}
{{Cmd|cd /mnt/mychroot|}}

==Unpacking system files & portage tree==
The next step is to download the stage3 and portage tarballs and set them up in the chroot location. For more information on this process please see sections 5a and 5b in the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=1&chap=5 Gentoo Handbook].
