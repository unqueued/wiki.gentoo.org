== Set up a jabber server using eJabberd ==
This often fails at first try, cause that whole ejabberd-erlang-mnesia thing is really picky.
So, one hint may be to not initialize/start/test anything until you configured your final hostname selection in every config file. Changing hostname afterwards is causing problems, at least if you are not experienced with the above mentioned tools.

Second hint: If you experience errors and want to restart something here, you might have to stop Erlang nodes, which unfortunatly are not called 'erlang' or something, but 'beam', so you might find this useful:
:killall beam -9

=== Installation ===

:USE="mod_pubsub mod_muc"
:emerge ejabberd
This will trigger things like: net-im/jabber-base, dev-lang/erlang, net-im/ejabberd...

=== Configuration ===

In /etc/jabber/ejabberd.cfg put:
:{acl, admin, {user, "bob", "s端percomputer"}}.
and
:{hosts, ["foo.bar"]}.
where foo.bar is what your wnat for your accounts, like bob@foo.bar
(so your server should be available at foo.bar. If not, clientside configuration needs extra server parameter.)


In /etc/jabber/ejabberctl.cfg put:
:ERLANG_NODE=ejabberd
so your node will be calles ejabberd@s端percomputer
while s端percomputer is the one configured in /etc/conf.d/hostname
If you change this, remember to call /etc/init.d/hostname restart

Then start:
:/etc/init.d/ejabberd start
Then create users:
:ejabberdctl register {name} {domain} {password}
for example:
:ejabberdctl register bob foo.bar s端persecret
