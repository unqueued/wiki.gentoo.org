== Installation ==

{{RootCmd|USE{{=}}"mod_pubsub mod_muc" emerge net-im/ejabberd}}

Adding various modules through USE flags will trigger things like: {{Package|net-im/jabber-base}}, {{Package|dev-lang/erlang}}, {{Package|net-im/ejabberd}}, etc. to be installed with ejabberd.

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===
{{Dated}} 
'''NOTE: ejabberd.cfg has been superseded by ejabberd.yml, which is formatted in a completely different way. If you have an old .cfg config file, "man ejabberdctl" for an automatic conversion script, see ''convert_to_yaml''.'''

In {{Path|/etc/jabber/ejabberd.cfg}} put:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/jabber/ejabberd.cfg|1=
:{acl, admin, {user, "bob", "s端percomputer"<nowiki>}}</nowiki>.
}}

And:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/jabber/ejabberd.cfg|1=
:{hosts, ["foo.bar"]}.
}}

Where foo.bar is what is required for the accounts, like bob@foo.bar (so the server should be available at foo.bar. If not, clientside configuration needs extra server parameter).

In {{Path|/etc/jabber/ejabberctl.cfg}} put:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/jabber/ejabberctl.cfg|1=
:ERLANG_NODE=ejabberd
}}

So the node will be called ejabberd@s端percomputer while s端percomputer is the one configured in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/hostname}} If this is changed, remember to issue:

{{Cmd|/etc/init.d/hostname restart}} 

=== Service ===

==== OpenRC ====

Then start:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/ejabberd start}}

Then create users:

{{Cmd|<nowiki>ejabberdctl register {name} {domain} {password}</nowiki>}}

For example:

{{Cmd|ejabberdctl register bob foo.bar s端persecret}}

=== Set up a jabber server using ejabberd ===

This often fails at first try, because the whole ejabberd-erlang-mnesia thing can be really picky sometimes.
So, one hint may be to not initialize/start/test anything until the final hostname selections are in every config file. Changing hostname afterwards can cause problems, at least before becoming familiar with the above mentioned tools.

Second hint: If errors are encountered when restarting here, Erlang nodes might have to be stopped, which unfortunately are not called 'erlang' or something, but 'beam', so this might be found useful:
{{Cmd|killall beam -9}}
