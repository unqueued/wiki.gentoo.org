== Set up a jabber server using eJabberd ==
This often fails at first try, cause that whole ejabberd-erlang-mnesia thing is really picky.
So, one hint may be to not initialize/start/test anything until you configured your final hostname selection in every config file. Changing hostname afterwards is causing problems, at least if you are not experienced with the above mentioned tools.

Second hint: If you experience errors and want to restart something here, you might have to stop Erlang nodes, which unfortunatly are not called 'erlang' or something, but 'beam', so you might find this useful:
:killall beam -9

=== Installation ===

:USE="mod_pubsub mod_muc"
:emerge ejabberd
This will trigger things like: net-im/jabber-base, dev-lang/erlang, net-im/ejabberd-2.1.13-r1...
