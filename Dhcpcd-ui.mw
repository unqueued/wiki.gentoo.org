'''dhcpcd-ui'''<ref>http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd-ui/</ref> provides the user interface and the graphical gtk, gtk3 and qt4 user interfaces for the {{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd}} package. <!--There is a nice and neat gtK+-{2,3}.0/QT4 UI for dhcpcd<ref>{{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd-ui}}</ref><ref>http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd-ui/</ref> to get a sane user interface via a systray icon without any crap *kit cruft -->
__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USEflags ===

To get one of the graphical user interfaces enable the respective USE flag.
{{USEflag|package=net-misc/dhcpcd-ui|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd-ui}}:
|debug
|gtk
|gtk3+++Add support for x11-libs/gtk&#043;-3 (The GIMP Toolkit) 
|libnotify
|qt4
}}

=== Emerge ===

Then install dhcpcd-ui and remove dhcpcd from the world file:

{{Emerge|net-misc/dhcpcd-ui}}

{{Emerge|params+=--deselect{{=}}y|net-misc/dhcpcd}}

=== Building from source ===

Alternatively, for installing the bleeding edge<ref>http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd-ui/timeline</ref> of dhcpcd-ui you can use the live ebuild from the bar overlay<ref>https://github.com/tokiclover/bar-overlay/tree/master/net-misc</ref>.

{{RootCmd|USE{{=}}git emerge app-portage/layman|echo "source /var/lib/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/portage/make.conf|layman -a bar|emerge --ask {{=}}net-misc/dhcpcd-ui-9999:bar|emerge --ask --deselect{{=}}y net-misc/dhcpcd}}

== Configuration ==

Uncomment the controlgroup line in {{Path|/etc/dhcpcd.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/dhcpcd.conf|lang=bash|1=
# Allow users of this group to interact with dhcpcd via the control socket.
controlgroup wheel}}

Change group and permissions of {{Path|/etc/dhcpcd.conf}} in order to make it writable for the user interface:

{{RootCmd|chgrp wheel /etc/dhcpcd.conf
|chmod g+w /etc/dhcpcd.conf}}

<!-- dhcpcd daemon should be running in master mode and not per interface. So don't use net.*, as explained in the previous sections, to ensure that dhcpcd is passed the -M flag which *might* allow it to work.

Also, >=net-misc/dhcpcd-6.4.4 is required with unprivileged socket ''or'' you need to be able to write to dhcpcd's socket. In newer versions you can say which group has ''read/write'' (RW) access to it in dhcpcd.conf (checkout the previous sections or dhcpcd.conf(5).) The default config has a commented out section which allows wheel group RW access. You should enable this and ensure your user is in the wheel group. If not, you'll need to add it and log out and then log in to get the effects of the change.

=== Starting the interface ===

The following line is enough to get the UI started in a simple X session without a display manager:

{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>...
dhcpcd-gtk >/dev/null 2>&1 &
...</pre>}}

That output redirection will avoid geting SSID/IP and other network informations displayed in the parrent shell.

Or else, checkout out the documentation of your Desktop Environment for DE integration. -->
