AQEMU is [[Article description::a user-friendly GUI front-end to the [[QEMU]] and [[KVM]] emulators]]. The AQEMU front-end is written using the QT4 framework.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/aqemu}}

=== Emerge ===

Install <tt>aqemu</tt>:

{{Emerge|app-emulation/aqemu}}

== Configuration ==

Configuration for AQEMU is a breeze. Simply follow the setup wizard to create a virtual hard drive, then set up a virtual machine.

=== Enabling VM graphical output ===

In version 0.8.2-r2 and down, there is no setting to enable the graphical output from the virtual machines. To have the machine display output to a GTK window an additional option currently not "supported" in AQEMU is needed. Presuming a virtual machine has already been created, follow these instructions:

# Start <tt>AQEMU</tt>.
# Click the {{Path|Advanced}} tab.
# Under {{Path|Additional QEME/KVM Arguments}} enter <code>-display gtk</code> in the textbox then click {{Path|Apply}}.
# Start the virtual machine. Output should be displayed in a GTK window.
