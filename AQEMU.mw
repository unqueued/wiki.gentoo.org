== Configuration ==

Configuration for AQEMU is a breeze. Simply follow the setup wizard to create a virtual hard drive, then set up a virtual machine.

=== Enabling VM graphical output ===
In version 0.8.2-r2 and down, there is no setting to enable the graphical output from the virtual machines. To have the machine display output to a GTK window an additional option currently not "supported" in AQEMU is needed. Presuming a virtual machine has already been created, follow these instructions:
# Start <tt>AQEMU</tt>.
# Click the {{Path|Advanced}} tab.
# Under {{Path|Additional QEME/KVM Arguments}} enter <code>-display gtk</code> in the textbox then click {{Path|Apply}}.
# Start the virtual machine. Output should be displayed in a GTK window.
