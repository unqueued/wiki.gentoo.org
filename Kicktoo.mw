'''Kicktoo''' is meant to automate the manual steps required to build a working Portage based distribution. The project is a fork from [http://agaffney.org/quickstart.php Quickstart] and under active development.

== Setup ==

You can use Kicktoo inside almost any Linux LiveCD, for instance a Gentoo minimal install CD, SysrescueCD or Ubuntu. Setup a pre-install environment by following these steps:

# Download the LiveCD.
# Boot the LiveCD.
# Setup network connectivity.

{{Warning|You should NOT run it on anything else than a LiveCD.}}

== Installation ==

You can install Kicktoo using three methods.

=== Version package ===

You can download the package from the [https://github.com/r1k0/kicktoo/tags Kicktoo website].

{{RootCmd
|cd ~
|wget "<nowiki>https://github.com/r1k0/kicktoo/archive/v1.zip"</nowiki>
|unzip v1.zip
|cd kicktoo-1
}}

=== Latest from Git ===

{{RootCmd
|cd ~
|git clone <nowiki>git://github.com/r1k0/kicktoo.git</nowiki>
}}

=== Ebuild ===
{{Dated|section}}
{{Important|This repository is no longer available with this method.}}
Alternatively, you can use the one provided by the ''ltsp'' [[ebuild repository]]:

{{RootCmd|layman -a ltsp}}

Then install the package:
{{Emerge|kicktoo}}

== Configuration ==

Kicktoo can be configured with a installer profile. Several example profiles are already available in the profiles directory.

{{RootCmd|ls -R /root/kicktoo/profiles}}

{{Note|When you installed using the ebuild, the profiles are available in {{Path|/usr/share/kicktoo/profiles}}.}}

== Running Kicktoo ==

Call the kicktoo application with the profile you just edited.

{{RootCmd|./kicktoo -p profiles/gentoo/gentoo.profile -v|reboot}}

{{Note|When you installed using the ebuild, the kicktoo app is available in {{Path|/usr/bin/kicktoo}}.}}
