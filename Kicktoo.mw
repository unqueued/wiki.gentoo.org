'''Kicktoo''' is meant to automate the manual steps required to build a working Portage based distro. The project is a fork from [http://agaffney.org/quickstart.php Quickstart] and under active development.

== Setup ==
You can use Kicktoo inside almost any Linux LiveCD, for instance a Gentoo minimal install CD, SysrescueCD or Ubuntu. Setup your pre-install environment by following these steps:
# Download the LiveCD
# Boot the LiveCD
# Setup network connectivity
{{Warning|You should NOT run it on anything else than a LiveCD.}}

== Installation ==
You can install Kicktoo using three methods.

=== Version Package ===
You can download the package from the [https://github.com/r1k0/kicktoo/tags Kicktoo website].
{{RootCmd
|cd ~
|wget "<nowiki>https://github.com/r1k0/kicktoo/archive/v1.zip"</nowiki>
|unzip v1.zip
|cd kicktoo-1
}}

=== Latest from Git ===
{{RootCmd
|cd ~
|git clone <nowiki>git://github.com/r1k0/kicktoo.git</nowiki>
}}

=== Ebuild ===
Alternatively, you can use the one provided by the ''ltsp'' [[overlay]]:
{{RootCmd|layman -a ltsp}}
{{Emerge|kicktoo}}

== Configuration ==
Kicktoo can be configured with a installer profile. Several example profiles are already available in the profiles directory.
{{RootCmd|ls -R /root/kicktoo/profiles}}
{{Note|When you installed using the ebuild, the profiles are available in {{Path|/usr/share/kicktoo/profiles}}.}}

== Running Kicktoo ==
Call the kicktoo application with the profile you just edited.
{{RootCmd|./kicktoo -v profiles/gentoo/gentoo.profile|reboot}}
{{Note|When you installed using the ebuild, the kicktoo app is available in {{Path|/usr/bin/kicktoo}}.}}
