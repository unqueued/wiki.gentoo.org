 - Up arrow or k -> opposite of Down arrow
 - PageDown -> scroll the list down by 10 unit
 - PageUp -> opposite of PageDown
 - End -> go to the last file of the list
 - Home -> go to the first file of the list
 - t -> order the list of files by date, most recent on top
 - a -> order the list of files alphabetically, the first time by category,
        the second time (pressing the key again) by package name
 - c -> order the list of files by log class warning level
 - r -> reverse the list of files

 - h or F1 -> show the help screen, press Page Up/Down to scroll up and down,
              h or F1 again to hide

            da -> removes all files
            de -> removes from selected item to the end of the list
