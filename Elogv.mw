Elogv is a portage elog viewer based on curses and python,
you can use these keys to control the behavior of the program:

 - Down arrow or j -> scroll the list of files down by 1 unit
 - Up arrow or k -> opposite of Down arrow
 - PageDown -> scroll the list down by 10 unit
 - PageUp -> opposite of PageDown
 - End -> go to the last file of the list
 - Home -> go to the first file of the list
 - t -> order the list of files by date, most recent on top
 - a -> order the list of files alphabetically, the first time by category,
        the second time (pressing the key again) by package name
 - c -> order the list of files by log class warning level
 - r -> reverse the list of files
 - SpaceBar -> scroll the selected file
 - h or F1 -> show the help screen, press Page Up/Down to scroll up and down,
              h or F1 again to hide
 - d -> removes selected files, usage is similar to vim "d" command,
        here are same examples:
            da -> removes all files
            de -> removes from selected item to the end of the list
            ds -> remove from selected item to the start of the list

        package that contains your string, use ESC to exit
