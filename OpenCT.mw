CTAPI is a german standard for PC to smartcard reader communication, which is implemented by OpenCT. The international standard is in contrast [[PCSC-Lite|PC/SC]].

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You have to enable kernel support depending on how your cardreader is connected:
* For USB cardreader see the [[USB]] article.
* For PC-Card cardreader see the [[PC-Card]] article.
* For serial cardreader enable serial support.

=== Software ===
Portage knows the local USE flag ''openct'' for enabling support for OpenCT in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|dev-libs/openct}} automatically:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||
USE{{=}}"... openct ..."
}}
The USE flags of openct are:
{{USEflag|package=dev-libs/openct
|debug
|doc
|pcsc-lite+yes
|udev+yes
|usb+yes
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --changed-use --deep world}}

== Configuration ==
USB cardreader are detected automatically und work out of the box. For PC-Card and serial cardreader you have to adjust your {{Path|/etc/reader.conf.d/reader.conf}}. See the ''reader.conf'' [[man page]] for more information.

=== Permissions ===
Add your user to the ''openct'' group to be able to access the cardreader:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a larry openct}}

=== Service ===
You can now start OpenCT:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/openct start}}
To start OpenCT at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add openct default}}

{{Note|The OpenCT daemon blocks all detected cardreaders for every other software. An exception is, if you use the ifdhandler for PCSC-Lite, see below.}}

== Testing ==
List all detected cardreaders:
{{Cmd|openct-tool list}}

If there is a detected cardreader, insert a smartcard. Test the access by checking the [[Wikipedia:Answer to reset|ATR]]:
{{Cmd|openct-tool atr|output=<pre>
Detected CCID Compatible
Card present, status changed
ATR: 3B 75 94 00 00 62 02 02 03 01
</pre>}}

== ifdhandler ==
If you installed OpenCT with ''pcsc-lite'' USE flag, a pseudo ifd driver is installed, so that [[PCSC-Lite]] kann use the OpenCT drivers. Additionally you have to do some extra steps, so that PCSC-Lite recognizes the idf driver:
{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /usr/lib/readers/usb/ifd-openct.bundle/Contents/Linux
|ebuild /usr/portage/dev-libs/openct/openct-0.6.20.ebuild unpack
|cp /var/tmp/portage/dev-libs/openct-0.6.20/work/openct-0.6.20/etc/Info.plist /usr/lib/readers/usb/ifd-openct.bundle/Contents
|ln -s /usr/lib/openct-ifd.so /usr/lib/readers/usb/ifd-openct.bundle/Contents/Linux/
|cp /var/tmp/portage/dev-libs/openct-0.6.20/work/openct-0.6.20/etc/reader.conf.in /etc/readers.conf.d/openct.conf
|sed -i -e "s/@libdir@/}/\/usr\/lib/" /etc/reader.conf.d/openct.conf
|update-reader.conf
}}
{{Note|These steps are only necessary until {{Bug|310985}} is fixed.}}
