=== About USE flags === 
For more information regarding USE flags, refer to the [https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/use-flags USE flags] chapter from the Gentoo Development Guide. 

=== Java specific USE flags ===
There are a few specific common USE flags for Java ebuilds as follows. These use flags do not go in the normal <code>USE</code> variable but go in <code>JAVA_PKG_IUSE</code> instead. Any use flag other than the following would go in the normal <code>USE</code> variable. The <code>JAVA_PKG_IUSE</code> must precede the <code>inherit</code .

The USE flags that go in <code>JAVA_PKG_IUSE</code>

* The <code>doc</code> flag will build API documentation using javadoc.
* The <code>source</code> flag installs a zip of the source code of a package. This is traditionally used for IDEs to 'attach' source to the libraries that are being use;
* The <code>test</code> flag will run JUnit tests against the package (tests are not installed)
