==== About USE flags ====

For more information regarding USE flags, refer to the [https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/use-flags USE flags] chapter from the Gentoo Development Guide. 

==== Java specific USE flags ====

There are a few specific common USE flags for Java ebuilds as follows. These use flags do not go in the normal <var>USE</var> variable but go in <var>JAVA_PKG_IUSE</var> instead. Any use flag other than the following would go in the normal <var>USE</var> variable. The <var>JAVA_PKG_IUSE</var> must precede the [https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/using-eclasses/ <code>inherit</code>] line in an ebuild.

The USE flags that go in <var>JAVA_PKG_IUSE</var>

* The <code>doc</code> flag will build API documentation using javadoc.
* The <code>source</code> flag installs a zip of the source code of a package. This is traditionally used for IDEs to 'attach' source to the libraries that are being use;
