== Requirements ==

=== Software ===

The following software can be used for in-kernel default suspend/hibernate implementation, namely, ''swsusp''.

{{RootCmd
|emerge --ask sys-power/suspend
|prompt=root <span style{{=}}"color:blue;">linux #</span>
}}

Another alternative is {{Package|sys-power/hibernate-script}} which can be used with swsusp and TuxOnIce patched kernels.

=== Kernel ===
Make sure the following variables are set to 'yes':
SUSPEND
HIBERNATION

== Available suspend modes ==
To see available suspend modes use
{{RootCmd
|cat /sys/power/state
|prompt=root <span style{{=}}"color:blue;">linux #</span>
}}
for swsusp, default implementation.

Or else, probe `/sys/power/tuxonice/powerdown_method' sysfs file for ToI.

Those two file will list at least [[ACPI]] S2/4 power down methods on modern hardware.
New hardware would also support S5 method which is a rough S4 method.
ACPI S2 correspond to suspend to ram (''ram'' method is swsusp terms and ''3'' in ToI terms);
S4 hibernation to disk (''disk'' in swsusp temrs and ''4'' in ToI terms; S5 hibernation to disk (''5'' in ToI terms).

Swsusp users can choose between ''platfom'', meaning ACPI, or *shutdown* methods which can be echo-ed to `/sys/power/disk' sysfs file.

{{Note|TuxOnIce can be configured to take over swsusp syspend/hibernation methods. So any command echo-ed to either file will triger the same result.}}

== Suspend to RAM ==

Preferred commands to suspend are
{{RootCmd
|pm-suspend
|prompt=root <span style{{=}}"color:blue;">linux #</span>
}}
or
{{RootCmd
|s2ram
|prompt=root <span style{{=}}"color:blue;">linux #</span>
}}
or
{{RootCmd
|hibernate-ram
}}
for suspend (to ram) for hibernate-script users;
or
{{RootCmd
|hibernate
|prompt=root <span style{{=}}"color:blue;">linux #</span>
}}
to hibernate (to disk.)

A more raw method is to 
{{RootCmd
|echo mem > /sys/power/state
|prompt=root <span style{{=}}"color:blue;">linux #</span>
}}
or
{{RootCmd
|echo 3 > /sys/power/tuxonice/powerdown_method
}}
for TuxOnIce users. An then
{{RootCmd
|echo > /sys/power/tuxonice/do_hibernate
}}
is necessary to trigger a suspend/hibernation.

== Suspend to disk ==
for suspend to disk make sure you have a swap partition or swap file
The swap file should be active beforehand obviously and should be echo-ed on the appropriate file before any atempt to suspend/hibernate.

{{RootCmd
|echo /dev/sda1 > /sys/power/resume
}}
or
{{RootCmd
|echo /dev/sda1 > /sys/power/tuxonice/swap/swapfile
}}
for ToI users.

Do not forget to probe
{{RootCmd
|cat /sys/power/tuxonice/swap/headerlocations
}}
before issueing an actual command and append the result to kernel command line argument prepended with `resume='.
This will suffice to resume from a block device or swap file for ToI.
However, it's more complicated for a swapfile with swsusp. 

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Can not resume after suspend ===
In case resuming from suspend does not work, disable the security chip in BIOS/UEFI and try again.
