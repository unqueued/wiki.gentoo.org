== Requirements ==

=== Software ===

The following software can be used for in-kernel default suspend/hibernate implementation, namely, ''swsusp''.

{{Emerge
|sys-power/suspend
}}

Also you must unmerge [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-power/upower sys-power/upower] and emerge [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-power/upower-pm-utils sys-power/upower-pm-utils]. Otherwise there might not be a "Suspend" and "Hibernate" button in the menu of your DE. Checked on KDE 4.

{{Emerge
|sys-power/upower
|params=--unmerge
}}

{{Emerge
|sys-power/upower-pm-utils
}}

Another alternative is {{Package|sys-power/hibernate-script}} which can be used with swsusp and TuxOnIce patched kernels.

=== Kernel ===
Make sure the following variables are set to 'yes':

{{KernelBox|
Power management and ACPI options --->
    [*] Suspend to RAM and standby
    [*] Hibernation (aka 'suspend to disk')
}}

== Available suspend modes ==
To see available suspend modes use
{{RootCmd|cat /sys/power/state}}
for swsusp, default implementation.

Or else, probe <code>/sys/power/tuxonice/powerdown_method</code> sysfs file for ToI.

Those two file will list at least [[ACPI]] S2/4 power down methods on modern hardware.
New hardware would also support S5 method which is a rough S4 method.
ACPI S2 correspond to suspend to ram (''ram'' method is swsusp terms and ''3'' in ToI terms);
S4 hibernation to disk (''disk'' in swsusp temrs and ''4'' in ToI terms; S5 hibernation to disk (''5'' in ToI terms).

Swsusp users can choose between ''platfom'', meaning ACPI, or *shutdown* methods which can be echo-ed to `/sys/power/disk' sysfs file.

{{Note|TuxOnIce can be configured to take over swsusp syspend/hibernation methods. So any command echo-ed to either file will triger the same result.}}

== Suspend to RAM ==

Preferred commands to suspend are
{{RootCmd|pm-suspend}}
or
{{RootCmd|s2ram}}
or
{{RootCmd|hibernate-ram}}
for suspend (to ram) for hibernate-script users;
or
{{RootCmd|hibernate}}
to hibernate (to disk.)

A more raw method is to 
{{RootCmd|echo mem > /sys/power/state}}
or
{{RootCmd|echo 3 > /sys/power/tuxonice/powerdown_method}}
for TuxOnIce users. An then
{{RootCmd|echo > /sys/power/tuxonice/do_hibernate}}
is necessary to trigger a suspend/hibernation.

== Suspend to disk ==
for suspend to disk make sure you have a swap partition or swap file
The swap file should be active beforehand obviously and should be echo-ed on the appropriate file before any atempt to suspend/hibernate.

{{RootCmd|echo /dev/sda1 > /sys/power/resume}}
or
{{RootCmd|echo /dev/sda1 > /sys/power/tuxonice/swap/swapfile}}
for ToI users.

A more raw method is to 
{{RootCmd|echo disk > /sys/power/state}}

Do not forget to probe
{{RootCmd|cat /sys/power/tuxonice/swap/headerlocations}}
before issuing an actual command and append the result to kernel command line argument prepended with `resume='.
This will suffice to resume from a block device or swap file for ToI.
However, it's more complicated for a swapfile with swsusp. 

=== Suspend to disk with sys-power/pm-utils ===

Yet another way to achieve disk hibernation is to use hibernate to swap partition and pm-utils.

First, make sure you have a swap partition set.

{{RootCmd|swapon -s}}

For this example, we will assume it's <code>/dev/sdc2</code>

Edit <code>/etc/default/grub</code> and append the resume kernel option to <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> pointing to you swap partition.

{{FileBox|title=GRUB Config|filename=/etc/default/grub
|1=GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=/dev/sdc2"
}} 

Rebuild your grub2 config: 

{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

Update initramfs:

{{RootCmd|genkernel --install initramfs}}

Add the following to /etc/pm/config.d/gentoo (see [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338239 bug 338239]):
{{FileBox|title=|filename=/etc/pm/config.d/gentoo
|1=SLEEP_MODULE="kernel"
}} 

Reboot the system:

{{RootCmd|reboot}}

Next, try 

{{RootCmd|pm-hibernate}}

=== Suspend to disk with swapfile ===

You can use suspend to disk with swapfile. You must create swapfile and configure GRUB.

Find UUID, where your swapfile place. For example /dev/sda (it may be LVM volume)

{{Note|If swapfile place at LVM volume, GRUB must be compiled with LVM support. Else system will not resume and will be cold start}}

{{RootCmd|blkid /dev/sda}}

Find offset of swapfile on partition

{{RootCmd|swap-offset /path/to/swapfile}}

After that edit GRUB config and add some parameters to boot string

{{FileBox|title=GRUB Config |filename=/etc/defaults/grub
|1=GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=UUID=UUID_of_partition resume_offset=offset_of_swapfile"
}}

Rebuild GRUB config

{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

After reboot you can hibernate the system. 

{{Note|Remember swap file must contain all RAM!}}

== Troubleshooting ==

In troubleshooting suspend you can help log

{{RootCmd|less /var/log/pm-powersave.log}}

=== Can not resume after suspend ===

In case resuming from suspend does not work, disable the security chip in BIOS/UEFI and try again.
