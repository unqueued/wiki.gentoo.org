{{c|cgit}} is [[Article description::a fast web-interface ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875.txt CGI]) for {{c|[[git]]}} written in the C programming language.]] It makes it possible for potential contributors to track and view project source code from the web instead of through a git client. {{c|cgit}} is licensed under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html GPLv2].

{{c|cgit}} is written and maintained by Gentoo developer {{Dev|zx2c4}}.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=www-apps/cgit}}

{{c|cgit}} can be managed though {{c|webapp-config}} if the <code>vhosts</code> USE flag is enabled. Without <code>vhosts</code> it will install into normal directories.

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|www-apps/cgit}}

After installation some post-install instructions should be viable in the output from the install command. Please read these instructions carefully before proceeding to use {{c|cgit}}.

=== Web server ===

{{c|cgit}} depends upon a web server in order to operate as intended. Fortunately several web servers are available through Portage:

* [[Apache]]
* [[Nginx]]
* [[Lighttpd]]

After installing and configuring a web server of choice return here to continue the {{c|cgit}} configuration process.

== Configuration ==

Relative configuration files include:

* {{Path|/etc/cgitrc}} - The global configuration file. This is used to modifying settings for all users.

== Usage ==

Coming soon...

== Tips ==

=== Update repository list automatically ===

If you would like to update the list of git repositories in cgit automatically consider adding something similar to the following as a cron job:

{{GenericCmd|/usr/share/webapps/cgit/<version_number>/hostroot/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi --scan-tree{{=}}/git/repo-parent-path > /etc/cgit-repos}}

{{Important|Be sure to replace <code><version_number></code> in the string above with the appropriate <tt>cgit</tt> version.}}

Then add <code>include=/etc/cgit-repos</code> into the {{Path|/etc/cgitrc}} global configuration file. This way it is simpler and more convenient. You won't need to update your cgitrc every time you add a new repository.
