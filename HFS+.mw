The [[filesystem]] HFS+ is [[Article description::the native filesystem of Mac&nbsp;OS 8.1+ and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X up to 10.12 Sierra]]; Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X is a Unix-based operating system with a BSD core. Up to Version 10.5 Leopard it can on PowerPC and starting from Version 10.4 Tiger it runs on x86. It was renamed to OS&nbsp;X with version 10.18 Mountain Lion and to macOS with version 10.12 Sierra, which is the last to use HFS+ as the primary filesystem of the base installation. Its successor is APFS.

On PowerPC-based Macs it is recommended to also select support for the Apple Partition Map (APM), on Intel-based Macs the GUID Partition Table (GPT) is used.
Since HFS partitions are normally only found on Apple Partition Maps (APM), enable this partitioning scheme in the kernel:

=== Emerge ===
==== diskdev_cmds ====

The {{Package|sys-fs/diskdev_cmds}} package is a port of HFS/HFS+ utilities from OpenDarwin, the BSD core operating system of macOS. It includes {{c|mkfs}} and {{c|fsck}} userspace utilities.

{{Emerge|sys-fs/diskdev_cmds}}

The commands have names common to OpenDarwin: {{c|newfs_hfs}} and {{c|fsck_hfs}}. The package creates symlinks to {{c|mkfs.hfsplus}} and {{c|fsck.hfsplus}}. To create a new filesystem on a partition, e.g. on {{Path|/dev/sda2}}, use:
{{RootCmd|newfs_hfs /dev/sda2}}
{{Note|{{c|newfs_hfs}} is able to create a [[HFS]] and a HFS+ filesystem. With the option -w it can also add a HFS wrapper to a HFS+ partition. Other options include -v "Volume Label". See the {{Man|newfs_hfs|8}} manpage for more information.}}
{{Warning|Creating a new filesystem will delete all data on the specified partition! Be '''very sure''' about the specified device file! (E.g. {{Path|/dev/sda2}})}}

==== hfsplusutils ====

The {{Package|sys-fs/hfsplusutils}} package was traditionally used on PowerPC based Macs. It provides utilities similar to those for [[HFS]] from the {{Package|sys-fs/hfsutils}} package.

{{Emerge|sys-fs/hfsplusutils}}

With {{Package|sys-fs/hfsplusutils}} a filesystem isn't mounted as part of {{Path|/}}, instead the provided utilities allow limited access to the filesystem.

{{RootCmd|mac-fdisk -l /dev/sda |collapse-output=true |output=<pre>/dev/sda
        #                    type name                  length   base      ( size )  system
/dev/sda1     Apple_partition_map Apple                     63 @ 1         ( 31.5k)  Partition map
/dev/sda2              Apple_Boot NewWorld Bootblock   1286080 @ 64        (628.0M)  Unknown
/dev/sda3              Apple_Free Extra                1073152 @ 1286144   (524.0M)  Free space
/dev/sda4               Apple_HFS Tiger              209715200 @ 2359296   (100.0G)  HFS
...</pre>}}

{{Note|On PowerPC Macs with Apple Partition Map, both HFS and HFS+ filesystems are type Apple_HFS. Special partitions, such as case-sensitive HFS+ or SoftwareRAID partitions, will be Apple_HFSX.}}

{{Note|Some HFS+ partitions have a [[HFS]] wrapper partition for compatibility reasons which cannot be used.}}

Select the partition with {{c|hpmount}}:

{{RootCmd|hpmount /dev/sda4}}

On the selected partition, the commands {{c|<nowiki>hp[ls|pwd|mkdir|cd|copy|rm]</nowiki>}} can be used for file operations, instead of Unix "/" for directories the colon ":" has to be used. E.g. /dir/to/file will be :dir:to:file for the specified commands.

{{RootCmd|hpls|output=<pre>Apple Extras     Desktop Folder   Develop</pre>}}

The partition is released with the {{c|hpumount}} utility.

{{RootCmd|hpumount /dev/sda4}}

{{Note|For further help refer to the manpage ({{c|man 1 hfsp}}).}}
