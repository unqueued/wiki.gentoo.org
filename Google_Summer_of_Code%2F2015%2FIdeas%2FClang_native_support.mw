|Clang native support|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
'''Clang is the main compiler of many operating systems and it is already working well on Linux, why not on Gentoo?'''. This project aims in making clang the main compiler in a Gentoo distribution. This involves updating a number of tools (e.g. gcc-config), eclasses (toolchain), Standard C++ library support and Clang build system itself. This project requires more than high dedication and ability to interact with multiple parties.|
