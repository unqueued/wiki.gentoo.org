It is possible to create themes for Plymouth, however documentation for theme creation is extremely difficult to find on the internet. This page aims to provide a few helpful links so that one understand the Plymouth theme creation process. Eventually there may be a tutorial (how-to) on how to create a simple theme, however first the author must gather a bit more time to write it.

Of course, you will need [[Plymouth]] before you can actually view or test any newly created themes.

Any potential theme creator should have a bit of knowledge about programming in C, as C is the language Plymouth is written in. A full depth of knowledge will most likely not be required.
