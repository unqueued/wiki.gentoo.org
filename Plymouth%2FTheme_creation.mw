It is possible to create themes for Plymouth, however documentation for theme creation is extremely difficult to find on the internet. This page aims to provide a few helpful links so that one may understand the Plymouth theme creation process. Eventually there may be a tutorial (or 'guide' as we like to call them here on the wiki) on how to create a simple theme.

Of course, [[Plymouth]] must be installed before any newly created themes can be viewed or tested. Head up a level and do that now if it is not done yet.

Any potential theme creator should have a bit of knowledge about programming in C, as C is the language Plymouth is written. A full depth of knowledge will not be required.

== How Plymouth works ==

Before starting a design process, it is important to know how the program(s) being used in project operate.

As Plymouth's [https://cgit.freedesktop.org/plymouth/plain/README README states]:

<blockquote>
plymouth ships with two binaries: {{Path|/sbin/plymouthd}} and {{Path|/bin/plymouth}}

The first one, {{Path|plymouthd}}, does all the heavy lifting. It logs the session and shows the splash screen. The second one, {{Path|/bin/plymouth}}, is the control interface to {{c|plymouthd}}.

It supports things like {{c|plymouth show-splash}}, or {{c|plymouth ask-for-password}}, which trigger the associated action in plymouthd.<ref>https://cgit.freedesktop.org/plymouth/plain/README</ref></blockquote>

== Creating a simple Plymouth theme ==

=== Design ===

Before something can be well engineering, there must first be a plan. The plan is what happens during the design phase. For the purpose of keeping this article short and sweet, we will be modifying the default "Solar" Plymouth theme to include some text: "My First Theme".

=== The files ===

The files for the Solar theme come with Plymouth. On Gentoo systems they can be found in the {{Path|/usr/share/plymouth/themes/solar}} directory. Change to this directory now.

=== Test ===

Testing and debugging can be performed from an X environment. Start {{c|plymouthd}} in non-daemon mode:

{{RootCmd|plymouthd --no-daemon --debug}}

Ask to render the splash via the plymouth front end:

{{RootCmd|plymouth show-splash}}

To stop the rendering, {{c|[[ssh]]}} to the unit and issue:

{{RootCmd|plymouth quit}}

=== Build ===

==== genkernel-next ====

Presuming {{c|genkernel-next}} has been merged with the <code>plymouth</code> USE flag, and then configured to select a specific theme in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}}:

{{RootCmd|genkernel initramfs}}

==== dracut ====
