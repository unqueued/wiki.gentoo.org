It is possible to create new themes for Plymouth, however documentation for theme creation is extremely difficult to find on the internet. This page will provide you with some helpful links for you to review the theme creation creation process. Eventually there may be a tutorial on how to create a simple theme in this article, however first the author must gather a bit more time to write it.

Of course, you will need [[Plymouth]] before you can actually view or test any themes you may create.
