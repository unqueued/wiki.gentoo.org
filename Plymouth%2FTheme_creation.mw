It is possible to create themes for Plymouth, however documentation for theme creation is extremely difficult to find on the internet... 

This page will provide you with some helpful links so that you can understand the theme creation process. Eventually there may be a tutorial on how to create a simple theme in this article, however first the author must gather a bit more time to write it...

Of course, you will need [[Plymouth]] before you can actually view or test any themes you may create.

Know going in if you do want to create a theme you will need to know a bit about programming in C.
