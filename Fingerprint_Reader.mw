Many Laptops come with an integrated fingerprint reader which can be used for authentication instead of a password.
The [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint fprint project] is the most advanced approach to provide a solution for integrating fingerprint readers in Linux - other solutions such as [http://thinkfinger.sourceforge.net/download.php thinkfinger] are mostly outdated and don't provide such a general approach as fprint does.

fprint consists of several components:
; libfprint : The basic library which does all the dirty work like talking to all the different fingerprint readers, providing an abstracted interface etc.
; fprintd : A daemon which provides access to fprint functionality through D-Bus to applications, such as login managers (GDM, KDM, ...), screen locking mechanisms etc.
; pam_fprint : A [[PAM]] module for fprint.

== TODO ==
* Gnome/KDE integration and development status of this features
* Simple PAM integration using fprintd
