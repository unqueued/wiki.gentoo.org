Some laptops (especially those of the [[wikipedia:ThinkPad|ThinkPad]] persuasion) come with an integrated fingerprint reader which can be used for authentication. Many guide expect the reader to be used in the place of a password. It is highly imperative to note: fingerprint reader technology is ''not'' considered to be secure by security experts.<ref>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/iphone_fingerpr.html</ref> Fingerprints should '''''not''''' be substituted for passwords for any device. Passwords can be easily changed; fingers cannot.<ref>http://motherboard.vice.com/read/stealing-fingerprints</ref> There are many known techniques to extract fingerprints from the device casing in order to gain access to the system through the fingerprint reader.

With the above paragraph being understood, it is perfectly acceptable to use a fingerprint to identify the user account before signing with key-based authentication.

{{Note|The [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint fprint project] is probably the most advanced approach to provide a solution for integrating fingerprint readers in Linux - other solutions such as [http://thinkfinger.sourceforge.net/download.php thinkfinger] are mostly outdated and do not provide such a general approach as well as {{c|fprint}}.}}
