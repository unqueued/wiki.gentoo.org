[[Article description::An '''init system''' is the first program, other than the kernel, to be run after a Linux distribution is booted]]. Due to the flexibility of Gentoo, several init systems are available for it. Beware, however, that even if another init system has been installed and set up quite often OpenRC is still required for other purposes.
