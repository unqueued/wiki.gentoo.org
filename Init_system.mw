[[Article description::An '''init system''' is the first program, other than the kernel, to be run after a Linux distribution is booted]]. Due to the flexibility of Gentoo, several init systems are available for it. Beware, however, that even if another init system has been installed and set up quite often [[OpenRC]] is still required for other purposes.
