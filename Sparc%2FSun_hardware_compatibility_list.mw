This Hardware Compatibility List details different Sun SPARC64 systems and linux kernel combinations that have been tested by the developer and user community with their known caveats.
== About this document ==

This document provides a listing of different Sun SPARC64 machine models and their compatibility with different linux kernel versions. 

This document does not guarantee that you will have similar results with the same hardware, but simply documents the experiences of others. Please keep this in mind if you are thinking of making purchasing decisions based on this document. 


{{Note|Unless otherwise stated the Net, Sound and Framebuffer columns are specifying builtin devices.}}

== Recommended kernel versions ==

We currently recommend 2.6-series kernels since 2.4-series are being phased out for Gentoo/SPARC and don't support the latest hardware like UltraSPARC-T1 processors. Usually the latest stable is preferred.
