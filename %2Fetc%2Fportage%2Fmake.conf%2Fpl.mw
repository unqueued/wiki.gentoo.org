The '''{{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}''' file (previously {{Path|/etc/make.conf}}) is [[Article description::used to customize the Portage environment on a global level.]] Settings here will apply to every package that is emerged. They control many elements of Portage functionality such as global USE flags, language (L10N) options, Portage mirrors, etc.

A very basic version gets installed [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Stage#Unpacking_the_stage_tarball|while extracting]] the [[stage tarball]] and an example setup can be found at {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/make.conf.example}}.

== Precedence == 

The final Portage configuration is not only based on {{path|make.conf}}. Global settings defined in this file can be refined (or redefined) on a per-package basis in the {{path|/etc/portage/package.use/}} files as well as through environment variables. Default settings managed by the distribution are available as well (partially through the Portage package defaults, partially through the Gentoo profile that is in use).

{{Note|Although Portage still supports the old {{Path|/etc/make.conf}} file location, its use is discouraged in favor of {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. When both files are available, the settings in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} take precedence over those in {{Path|/etc/make.conf}}.}}

== Zmienne ==

There are many possible variables to customize in {{Path|make.conf}}. Only the most commonly used ones are explained further within this article, with an example and a link to a more detailed article (if applicable). For more information, and the full list of variables, consult the {{Path|make.conf}} [[man page]] by running:

{{Cmd|man make.conf}}

{{Note|Different configurations will require different variables to be set up. Do not treat the following examples as a definitive list, or a minimum set of requirements.}}

=== CHOST ===

The <var>CHOST</var> variable is passed through the configure step of ebuilds to set the build-host of the system. Note that the Gentoo profile already sets the appropriate <var>CHOST</var> value, and updating it requires insight and experience in build chains.

=== CFLAGS i CXXFLAGS ===

The <var>CFLAGS</var> and <var>CXXFLAGS</var> variables define the build and compile flags that will be used for all package deployments (some exceptions notwithstanding who filter out flags known to cause problems with the package). The <var>CFLAGS</var> variable is for C based applications, while <var>CXXFLAGS</var> is meant for C++ based applications. Most users will keep the content of both variables the same.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|title=Commonly used sane setting for CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS|1=
CFLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
}}

For more information see the [[GCC optimization]] article and [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Stage#CFLAGS_and_CXXFLAGS|CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS]] in the Gentoo Handbook.

=== CONFIG_PROTECT ===

<!-- The text in this section is trancluded the CONFIG_PROTECT article. -->

{{:CONFIG_PROTECT/en}}

=== FEATURES ===

<!-- The text in this section is trancluded the FEATURES article. -->

{{:FEATURES/en}}

=== GENTOO_MIRRORS ===

See the [[GENTOO_MIRRORS]] article.

=== MAKEOPTS ===

The <var>MAKEOPTS</var> variable is used to specify arguments passed to {{c|make}} when packages are built from source. A commonly used setting is the <code>-j<var>N</var></code> which specifies the number of parallel {{c|make}} jobs that can be used for a single package build. A widely used rule of thumb for <var>N</var> is to take the number of available logical CPU cores. A physical CPU core employing a <var>X</var>-way SMT technique (eg. Hyper-Threading or SMT2) counts as <var>X</var> logical cores.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Recommended setting for a dual-core processor with Hyper-Threading enabled|lang=bash|1=
MAKEOPTS="-j4"
}}

See the [[MAKEOPTS]] article for more information.

{{Note|Read up on <code>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</code> as this variable influences build behavior as well.}}

=== EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS ===

<!-- The text in this section is trancluded the EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS article. -->

{{:EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS/en}}

=== PORTAGE_TMPDIR ===

The <var>PORTAGE_TMPDIR</var> variable defines the location of the temporary files for Portage. The value defaults to {{Path|/var/tmp}}, resulting in {{Path|/var/tmp/portage}} for the build location, {{Path|/var/tmp/ccache}} for Portage' [[Handbook:AMD64/Working/Features#Caching_compilation_objects|ccache]] support and so forth.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|title=Default PORTAGE_TMPDIR setting|1=
PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/var/tmp"
}}

=== DISTDIR ===

<!-- The text in this section is trancluded the DISTDIR article. -->

{{:DISTDIR/en}}

=== PORTDIR ===

<!-- The text in this section is trancluded the PORTDIR article. -->

{{:PORTDIR/en}}

=== PORTDIR_OVERLAY ===

The <var>PORTDIR_OVERLAY</var> variable has been deprecated in favor of the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf|repos.conf]]}} file.

[[Layman#make.conf_method_.28force_old_method.29|Layman]] versions less than 2.3.0 still use the <var>PORTDIR_OVERLAY</var> variable.

=== SYNC ===

See the [[:Project:Portage/Sync|SYNC]] article.

=== USE ===

The <var>USE</var> variable allows the system wide setting or deactivation of [[USE flag|USE flags]] in a space separated list. 

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]|title=[[Handbook:AMD64/Working/USE#Declare_permanent_USE_flags|Global USE flags example]]|lang=bash|1=
USE="-kde -qt5 ldap"
}}

For a fine grained [[Handbook:AMD64/Working/USE#Declaring_USE_flags_for_individual_packages|per package control]] of [[USE flag|USE flags]], the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/package.use]]}} file should be used instead.

=== ACCEPT_LICENSE ===

The <var>ACCEPT_LICENSE</var> variable tells Portage which software licenses are allowed. Packages who have a license that is not accepted cannot be installed on the system.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=To accept all [[:/usr/portage/licenses|licenses]] on all packages (not a good idea)|lang=bash|1=
ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"
}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=To accept free software only|lang=bash|1=
ACCEPT_LICENSE="-* @FREE"
}}

=== LINGUAS ===

See [[Localization/Guide#LINGUAS|LINGUAS in the Localization guide.]]

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
LINGUAS="de pt_BR en en_US en_GB"
}}

== USE_EXPAND ==

The <var>USE_EXPAND</var> variable is a list set in [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/profiles/base/make.defaults profiles/base/make.defaults] as of Portage 2.0.51.20.<ref>https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/use-flags/#use_expand-and-arch-use-flags</ref>

=== CPU_FLAGS_X86 ===

The <var>CPU_FLAGS_X86</var> variable informs Portage about the CPU flags (features) permitted by the CPU. This information is used to optimize package builds specifically for the targeted features.

The {{c|cpuid2cpuflags}} utility (found in the {{Package|app-portage/cpuid2cpuflags}} package) can be used to query a complete listing of CPU flags supported by the system's processor. After emerging the package, issue:

{{Cmd|cpuid2cpuflags|output=<pre>
CPU_FLAGS_X86: aes avx f16c mmx mmxext pclmul popcnt sse sse2 sse3 sse4_1 sse4_2 ssse3
</pre>}}

This flags can then be added to {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} or {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use/}}. Note that this is only effective on {{Keyword|x86}} and {{Keyword|amd64}} architectures.

See the [[CPU_FLAGS_X86]] article for more information.

=== INPUT_DEVICES ===

See the [[Xorg/Guide#make.conf|make.conf]] section of the Xorg/Guide article and the [https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/input_devices_libinput possible values].

=== L10N ===

See [[Localization/Guide#L10N|L10N in the localization guide]] and this [https://gentoo.org/support/news-items/2016-06-23-l10n-use_expand.html Repository News Item].
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
L10N="de pt-BR en en-US en-GB"
}}

{{Note|While common two letter language codes (like <code>de</code> or <code>fr</code>) are identical in <var>LINGUAS</var> and <var>L10N</var>, more complex entries have a different syntax because <var>L10N</var> uses [https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/ IETF language tags] (aka BCP 47). For example, <code>pt_BR</code> and <code>sr@latin</code> in <var>LINGUAS</var> become <code>pt-BR</code> and <code>sr-Latn</code> in <var>L10N</var>, respectively.}}

=== VIDEO_CARDS ===

For possible values of this <var>USE_EXPAND</var> variable see <var>[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/video_cards_vesa VIDEO_CARDS]</var>.

{{VIDEO_CARDS|intel nvidia radeon vesa}}

For the average user, if a graphical desktop environment is to be used this variable ''should'' be explicitly defined. For further information see [[Xorg/Guide#make.conf]].

For more details see the [[AMDGPU]] or the [[NVidia]] articles.
