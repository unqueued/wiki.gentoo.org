=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|sys-fs/mtpfs}}:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/mtpfs}}

== Configuration ==

=== Android devices ===

Android devices will need to be put into MTP mode. The way this is done changes slightly based on the version of Android running. On more modern versions, slide down the top of the screen once to show notifications. There should be a notification from the Android System indicating something to the effect of "USB debugging connected." Below this notification is a second notification. Tap the second notification, then change the setting from "Charge only" to "USB for file transfer."

=== Files ===

Modify {{Path|/etc/fuse.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fuse.conf|1=
user_allow_other
}}

=== User privileges ===

Appropriate user(s) need to be in the <code>plugdev</code> group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <USER_NAME> plugdev}}

== Usage ==

[[Mount]]:

{{Cmd|mkdir ~/AndroidDevice}}

{{Cmd|mtpfs ~/AndroidDevice|output=<pre>
Unable to open ~/.mtpz-data for reading, MTPZ disabled.
Device 0 (VID=0bb4 and PID=0c93) is a HTC EVO 4G LTE/One V (ID1).
Android device detected, assigning default bug flags
</pre>}}

{{Note|Be patient, as this can take several minutes. Upon successful mount, mtpfs will background itself.}}

Unmount:

{{Cmd|fusermount -u ~/AndroidDevice}}
