|Catalyst|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Catalyst is Gentoo's stage building software which automates the building of Gentoo's release media.  Unfortunately it's  [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/catalyst.git;a=summary software base] is in need of some major updating.  A rewrite has been started a couple of times.  The most recent [http://dev.gentoo.org/~dolsen/catalyst/ catalyst rewrite branch] will be the starting point for future work.  Catalyst is written in a combination of python and bash, much like it's package manager portage.  Problems with the original code include, not being installed to python's site-packages, poor code organization (growing pains), hard coded paths making changes difficult, not using what are now built-in python features and modules, etc..  An initial restructure has been done with some code split into smaller logical files/modules.  Also some of the hard coded paths have been made configurable.

==== Completion of code re-write ====
# Migrate more code to use python built-in's rather than it's own code.  ie: ConfigParser, argsparse,...
# Make more variables configurable, remove all remaining hard coded paths.
# Modularize the code further where it makes sense and reduce code duplication.
# Update or create docstrings for all functions and classes.
# Add more inline code comments to explain why something is done the way it is.
# Update portions of the code to match new features in portage, compression utilities, etc.
# Add more options for image types produced.
# Add more target types, like an arch testing target,...
# Separate out the command line code from the main operational api. This allows for the creation of alternate frontends or embedding catalyst's operation into other possible tasks. 
# debug!, debug!, debug!
==== Documentation ====
# Produce user instruction documentation about how to create/use the different target types
# Instructions for image generation options.
# Instructions for user configurable variables and how they might affect what is produced.
# Document anything else that may come up.
