'''pkg-config''' is a helper tool which is used to obtain compiler & linker flags when building a package depending on a library.

== Available implementations ==

In Gentoo, various implementations of pkg-config can be obtained {{Package|virtual/pkgconfig}}.

Currently available implementations are:
* {{Package|dev-util/pkgconfig}} — the official implementation; it requires {{Package|dev-libs/glib}} which causes a circular dependency;
* {{Package|dev-util/pkgconf}} — an alternative implementation in ANSI C;
* {{Package|dev-util/pkgconfig-openbsd}} — OpenBSD implementation in Perl.
