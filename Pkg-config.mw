'''pkg-config''' is a helper tool which is used to obtain compiler & linker flags when building a package depending on a library.

== Differences from other solutions ==

=== Custom ''-config'' applications ===

Many libraries provide custom applications of similar function, for example ''pcap-config''. Those applications are compiled along with the library, and often have the relevant compiler & linker flags compiled into itself.

==== Cross-compilation support ====

Usually, custom ''-config'' applications are built for the specific platform the library is built for. Effectively, they are of no use when cross-compiling if the host is unable to execute code for the target platform.

''pkg-config'' uses simple text files which are platform-independent. Thus, for cross-compilation to work it is only necessary to install ''pkg-config'' on the host system and set appropriate ''PKG_CONFIG_PATH''.

== Available implementations ==

In Gentoo, various implementations of pkg-config can be obtained {{Package|virtual/pkgconfig}}.

Currently available implementations are:
* {{Package|dev-util/pkgconfig}} — the official implementation; it requires {{Package|dev-libs/glib}} which causes a circular dependency;
* {{Package|dev-util/pkgconf}} — an alternative implementation in ANSI C;
* {{Package|dev-util/pkgconfig-openbsd}} — OpenBSD implementation in Perl.
