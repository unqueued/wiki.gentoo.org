The {{Path|/etc/resolv.conf}} file is [[Article description::used to configure hostname resolution.]] It may be manually configured by the system administrator, or may be automatically populated by various network configuration tools.

== NetworkManager ==

When using NetworkManager, {{Path|/etc/resolv.conf}} should be a symlink pointing at {{Path|/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf}}.

== systemd-resolved ==

There are multiple options for setting up a {{Path|resolv.conf}} symlink to work with systemd-resolved.

Two main features are supported:

* Stub resolver: the nameserver is pointed at systemd-resolved, listening on 127.0.0.53. DNS queries are executed by systemd-resolved.
* Search path: The "search" directive is used to configure default domain names to be used when resolving single-word DNS queries.

The available options/features depend on the version of systemd installed and which target is used for the symlink.

== openresolv ==

The {{Package|net-dns/openresolv}} package integrates with several other packages to dynamically update {{Path|/etc/resolv.conf}} when network configuration changes occur. When using openresolv, {{Path|/etc/resolv.conf}} should be a ''regular file''.
