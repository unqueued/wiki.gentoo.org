If my genious idea is implemented it will cause several beneficial results for Gentoo users and developers alike. Among other benefits:
* Improved Gentoo bugreporting/development skills
* Hightened levels of common sense
* Improved grammar of all written and spoken communication

== Development team == 
Owner: me <me at gentoo.org>

Team:
* myself <yourself at gentoo.org>
* someone that I used to know <noone at gentoo.org>

== Current Status ==
Last updated: DDMMYYYY

Target date (approximate): DDMMYYYY

Percentage of completion: XX[X]%

* Foo works as expected and already improved English comprehension levels among schoolchildren by more than 100%
* Bar is causing us trouble and makes our cows moo too much

== Description ==
This would be a place for a nice long essay about your idea if you are so inclined. You can even include diagrams and subsections!

== Dependencies == 
Any [[Ideas]] your idea depends on should be listed here.

== Contingency plan ==
What happens if your idea is not implemented 100% and Larrys start falling from skies? How will it affect Gentoo users. What would need to be done to rollback your changes. Possibly "N/A"

== Documentation ==
Are there any changes to our current documentation needed? (Handbook, devmanual, etc.)
