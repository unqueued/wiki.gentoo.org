Linux has the ability to power off USB devices and to let USB device requests to wake them up again.

It is important to note many optical mice do not support power saving. Once they lose power they cannot detect motion and cannot power back on when motion is invoked. With this being stated, it is possible to use specific driver calls or the sysfs {{Path|/sys/bus/usb/devices/usb[1-]/power/control}} file to enable or disable auto-suspend for individual USB peripherals.

== Configuration ==

{{KernelBox|1=
  Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support  --->
      <M>   Support for Host-side USB
      [*]     USB runtime power management (autosuspend) and wakeup
}}

{{Note|Starting with the 3.10 kernel release, dynamic power management support for USB is present when the kernel has been built with <code>CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME</code> enabled. The <code>CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND</code> option for USB runtime power management auto-suspend and wakeup has been eliminated.}}

{{KernelBox|1=
  Power management and ACPI options  --->
    [ ] Suspend to RAM and standby
    [ ] Hibernation (aka 'suspend to disk')
    [*] Run-time PM core functionality
    [ ] Power Management Debug Support  
}}

Set auto suspend to 1 second:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf|1=
options usbcore autosuspend=1
}}

Enforce for every device:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/60-power.rules|1=
SUBSYSTEM!="usb", GOTO="power_usb_rules_end"
ACTION!="add", GOTO="power_usb_rules_end"

KERNEL=="[0-9]*:*", WAIT_FOR_SYSFS="bInterfaceProtocol"
PROGRAM="/bin/sleep 0.1"

ATTR{power/level}=="*", ATTR{power/level}="auto"

LABEL="power_usb_rules_end"
}}

If you want to autosuspend specific USB device with newer kernels, you may install {{package|sys-apps/usbutils}} package and use <code>lsusb</code> utility to select specific device.
{{RootCmd|lsusb|output=<pre>
Bus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

</pre>}}
If you have PM_RUNTIME=y in the kernel config and want your A4Tech mouse to autosuspend after 45 minutes of idle state then you can add <code>usbcore.autosuspend=2700</code> parameter to your GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT string inside grub2 config file <code>/etc/default/grub</code> and then regenerate grub2 config from that file. After that you can add the following file into your local services:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/mouse_auto_sleep.start|1=
echo "auto" > /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-3/power/control
}}
As you see here bus number of the mice is 3 and the device number of 2 is autoincreased by 1 there by kernel into 3 (it's usual behaviour). Don't forget to make this file executable:
{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/local.d/mouse_auto_sleep.start}}
