Linux has the ability to power off USB devices and to let USB device requests to wake them up again.

It is important to note many optical mice do not support power saving. Once they lose power they cannot detect motion and cannot power back on when motion is invoked. With this being stated, it is possible to use specific driver calls or the sysfs {{Path|/sys/bus/usb/devices/usb[1-]/power/control}} file to enable or disable auto-suspend for individual USB peripherals.

== Kernel ==

{{KernelBox|1=
  Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support  --->
      <M>   Support for Host-side USB
      [*]     USB runtime power management (autosuspend) and wakeup
}}

{{Note|Starting with the 3.10 kernel release, dynamic power management support for USB is present when the kernel has been built with <var>CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME</var> enabled. The older <var>CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND</var> option for USB runtime power management auto-suspend and wakeup has been eliminated.}}

    [ ] Suspend to RAM and standby
    [ ] Hibernation (aka 'suspend to disk')
    [*] Run-time PM core functionality

}}

Set autosuspend to 1 second:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf|1=
options usbcore autosuspend=1
}}

Enforce for every device:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/60-power.rules|1=
SUBSYSTEM!="usb", GOTO="power_usb_rules_end"
ACTION!="add", GOTO="power_usb_rules_end"

KERNEL=="[0-9]*:*", WAIT_FOR_SYSFS="bInterfaceProtocol"
PROGRAM="/bin/sleep 0.1"

ATTR{power/level}=="*", ATTR{power/level}="auto"

LABEL="power_usb_rules_end"
}}

If to autosuspend a specific USB device with newer kernels install {{package|sys-apps/usbutils}} package and use {{c|lsusb}} utility to select specific device.

{{RootCmd|lsusb|output=<pre>
Bus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 05af:1012 Jing-Mold Enterprise Co., Ltd 
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 09da:9090 A4Tech Co., Ltd. XL-730K / XL-750BK / XL-755BK Mice
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
</pre>}}

If <code>PM_RUNTIME=y</code> has been set in the kernel config and want your A4Tech mouse to autosuspend after 45 minutes of idle state then add <code>usbcore.autosuspend=2700</code> as a value to the <var>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</var> variable inside the config file found in {{Path|/etc/default/grub}}. Regenerate the {{Path|grub.cfg}} config via the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} command and reboot in order for the changes to reflected on the next system reboot. 

{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /path/to/grub.cfg}}

Next add the following file into the local.d services:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/mouse_auto_sleep.start|1=
echo "auto" > /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-3/power/control
}}

As you see here bus number of the mouse is 3 and the device number of 2 is auto-increased by 1 there by kernel into 3 (its usual behavior). Do not forget to make the local.d file executable:

{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/local.d/mouse_auto_sleep.start}}

Read {{Path|/usr/src/linux/Documentation/usb/power-management.txt}} for more information on power management in Linux.
