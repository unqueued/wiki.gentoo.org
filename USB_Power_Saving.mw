Linux has the ability to power off USB devices and to let USB device requests to wake them up again.

It is important to note many optical mice do not support power saving. Once they lose power power they cannot detect motion and cannot power back on when motion is invoked. With this being stated, it is possible to use specific driver calls or the sysfs {{Path|/sys/bus/usb/devices/usb[1-]/power/control}} file to enable or disable auto-suspend for individual USB peripherals.

== Configuration ==

{{KernelBox|1=
  Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support  --->
      <M>   Support for Host-side USB
      [*]     USB runtime power management (autosuspend) and wakeup
}}

{{Note|Starting with the 3.10 kernel release, dynamic power management support for USB is present when the kernel has been built with <code>CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME</code> enabled. The <code>CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND</code> option for USB runtime power management auto-suspend and wakeup has been eliminated.}}

Set auto suspend to 1 second:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf|1=
options usbcore autosuspend=1
}}

Enforce for every device:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/60-power.rules|1=
SUBSYSTEM!="usb", GOTO="power_usb_rules_end"
ACTION!="add", GOTO="power_usb_rules_end"

KERNEL=="[0-9]*:*", WAIT_FOR_SYSFS="bInterfaceProtocol"
PROGRAM="/bin/sleep 0.1"

ATTR{power/level}=="*", ATTR{power/level}="auto"

LABEL="power_usb_rules_end"
}}
