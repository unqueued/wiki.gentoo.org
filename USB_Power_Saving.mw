Linux has the ability to poweroff USB devices and let the USB device request to wake up.

{{Note|Many optical mice does not support this, as once their power is down they cannot detect motion. However, driver calls or the sysfs '''/sys/bus/usb/devices/usb[1-]/power/control''' file can be used to enable or disable autosuspend for individual USB peripherals}}

== Configuration ==
{{KernelBox|1=
  Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support  --->
      <M>   Support for Host-side USB
      [*]     USB runtime power management (autosuspend) and wakeup
}}
{{Note|Starting with the 3.10 kernel release, dynamic PM support for USB is present whenever the kernel was built with CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME enabled. The CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND - USB runtime power management (autosuspend) and wakeup - option has been eliminated.}}

Set auto suspend to 1 seconds:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf|1=
options usbcore autosuspend=1
}}

Enforce for every device:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/60-power.rules|1=
SUBSYSTEM!="usb", GOTO="power_usb_rules_end"
ACTION!="add", GOTO="power_usb_rules_end"

KERNEL=="[0-9]*:*", WAIT_FOR_SYSFS="bInterfaceProtocol"
PROGRAM="/bin/sleep 0.1"

ATTR{power/level}=="*", ATTR{power/level}="auto"

LABEL="power_usb_rules_end"
}}
