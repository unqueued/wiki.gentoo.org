'''bspwm''' is a lightweight, tiling, minimalist [[window manager]] that is written in C and represents its windows as leaves on a binary tree. Its installed size is less than 600 KB (even with the <code>examples</code> USE flag enabled). It only responds to X events and messages it receives on a dedicated socket from a program included in its package, bspc.
