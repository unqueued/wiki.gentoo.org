'''bspwm''' is [[Article description::a lightweight, tiling, minimalist [[window manager]] that is written in C and represents its windows as leaves on a binary tree.]] Its installed size is less than 600 KB (even with the <code>examples</code> USE flag enabled). It only responds to X events and messages it receives on a dedicated socket from a program included in its package, {{c|bspc}}. 

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-wm/bspwm}}

=== Emerge ===

To install {{c|bspwm}} using Portage merely issue the command:

{{Emerge|x11-wm/bspwm}}

{{c|sxhkd}} is used for keybindings and pointer bindings so one may wish to install it too with:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/sxhkd}}

== Configuration ==

If you installed with <code>examples</code> local USE flag enabled, you have to configure '''bspwm''' properly.

First create the necessary directories that will hold your configurations. Because '''bspwm''' doesn't handle
keyboard or pointer inputs, it's using {{Package|x11-misc/sxhkd}} (Simple X hotkey daemon) to do so, therefore we'll need a config file for that as well because that's where all your key bindings will reside.

{{Cmd|mkdir -vp ~/.config/bspwm ~/.config/sxhkd}}

Now copy the sample configuration files from <code>/usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/</code> and, if required, extract them:

{{Cmd|cp -v /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/bspwmrc.bz2 ~/.config/bspwm/}}

{{Cmd|cp -v /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/sxhkdrc.bz2 ~/.config/sxhkd/}}

{{Cmd|prompt=user ~/.config/bspwm $|bunzip2 bspwmrc.bz2}}

{{Cmd|prompt=user ~/.config/sxhkd $|bunzip2 sxhkdrc.bz2}}

{{Note|The <code>bspwmrc</code> configuration file needs to be executable. Therefore, if it's not, you can
<code>chmod +x ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc</code>.}}

=== Autostart programs ===

If you have certain programs that want to start after logging in on the workstation (i.e. {{Package|net-misc/dropbox}}, {{Package|media-gfx/feh}})
you can achieve that by simply adding them in the bspwm config file

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc|lang=bash|title=bspwm configuration file|1=
# autostart programs
dropbox
feh --bg-scale ~/.config/my_wallpaper.png
${HOME}/.config/polybar/launch.sh
}}

=== Hide/Show windows ===

Some programs also have tray icons and one may want to mimic the ''Minimize'' behavior (''hide'' in the bspwm world), you can achieve that by setting a keyboard shortcut. Note that when restoring them, they will spawn in the same Monitor that they were hidden, just so you don't go look for them in the other Desktops randomly...

Found this useful tip on [https://www.reddit.com/r/bspwm/comments/99xzae/is_there_any_way_to_minimizemaximize_windows/e4rsh2l/ Reddit] after browsing for ''bspwm hide window''.

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc|title=sxhkd configuration file|1=<pre>
# hide window
super + v
  bspc node -g hidden

# unhide window
super + shift + v
  bspc node {,$(bspc query -N -n .hidden | tail -n1)} -g hidden=off
</pre>}}

== Additional software ==

=== dmenu ===

In order to launch whatever programs you desire

{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/dmenu}}

To assign a keyboard shortcut for launching <code>dmenu</code>:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc|lang=bash|title=sxhkd configuration file|1=
# program launcher
super + @space
  dmenu_run
}}

=== Terminal emulators ===

==== st aka suckless/simple terminal====

If '''lightweight''' is how you roll, this might be of use

{{USEflag|package=x11-terms/st}}

To install it, just issue the command:

{{Emerge|x11-terms/st}}

To enable a keyboard shortcut for launching the terminal

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc|lang=bash|title=sxhkd configuration file|1=
# terminal emulator
super + Return
  st
}}

==== rxvt-unicode aka urxvt ====

This is another alternative, although it lacks full unicode support and you '''might''' have some issues with Powerline Fonts.

{{USEflag|package=x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}}

You can install it issuing the command:

{{Emerge|x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}}

=== i3lock ===

Locking your screen is always recommended in order to avoid unauthorized access to your Workstation

{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/i3lock}}

You can install it by issuing the command:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/i3lock}}

In order to assign a keyboard shortcut for locking your screen, you should update your configuration file

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc|lang=bash|title=sxhkd configuration file|1=
# lock the screen with dark background
super + q
  i3lock -c 000000
}}

=== File managers ===

==== ranger ====

{{c|ranger}} is a console file manager with VI key bindings. It provides a minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy. It ships with <code>rifle</code>, a file launcher that is good at automatically finding out which program to use for what file type.

You can install {{c|ranger}} via

{{Emerge|app-misc/ranger}}

If you want to tune {{c|ranger}} with your own settings:

Start {{c|ranger}} and exit so that it creates the directory structure for its configuration files.

{{Cmd|ranger}}

{{Cmd|Q}}

Now copy the configuration files:

{{Cmd|ranger --copy-config{{=}}all|output=<pre>
creating: /home/user/.config/ranger/apps.py
creating: /home/user/.config/ranger/commands.py
creating: /home/user/.config/ranger/rc.conf
creating: /home/user/.config/ranger/options.py
creating: /home/user/.config/ranger/scope.sh
</pre>}}
