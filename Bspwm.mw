'''bspwm''' is [[Article description::a lightweight, tiling, minimalist [[window manager]] that is written in C and represents its windows as leaves on a binary tree.]] Its installed size is less than 600 KB (even with the <code>examples</code> USE flag enabled). It only responds to X events and messages it receives on a dedicated socket from a program included in its package, {{c|bspc}}. 

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-wm/bspwm}}

=== Emerge ===

To install {{c|bspwm}} using Portage merely issue the command:

{{Emerge|x11-wm/bspwm}}

{{c|sxhkd}} is used for keybindings and pointer bindings so one may wish to install it too with:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/sxhkd}}

== Configuration ==

If you installed with <code>examples</code> local USE flag enabled, you have to configure '''bspwm''' properly.

First create the necessary directories that will hold your configurations. Because '''bspwm''' doesn't handle
keyboard or pointer inputs, it's using {{Package|x11-misc/sxhkd}} (Simple X hotkey daemon) to do so, therefore we'll need a config file for that as well because that's where all your key bindings will reside.

{{Cmd|mkdir -vp ~/.config/bspwm ~/.config/sxhkd}}

Now copy the sample configuration files from <code>/usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/</code> and, if required, extract them:

{{Cmd|cp -v /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/bspwmrc.bz2 ~/.config/bspwm/}}

{{Cmd|cp -v /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/sxhkdrc.bz2 ~/.config/sxhkd/}}

{{Cmd|prompt=user ~/.config/bspwm|bunzip2 bspwmrc.bz2}}

{{Cmd|prompt=user ~/.config/sxhkd|bunzip2 sxhkdrc.bz2}}

{{Note|The <code>bspwmrc</code> configuration file needs to be executable. Therefore, if it's not, you can
<code>chmod +x ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc</code>.}}

=== Autostart programs ===

If you have certain programs that want to start after logging in on the workstation (i.e. {{Package|net-misc/dropbox}}, {{Package|media-gfx/feh}})
you can achieve that by simply adding them in the bspwm config file

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc|lang=bash|title=bspwm configuration file|1=
# autostart programs
dropbox
feh --bg-scale ~/.config/my_wallpaper.png
${HOME}/.config/polybar/launch.sh
}}

== Additional software ==

=== dmenu ===

In order to launch whatever programs you desire

{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/dmenu}}

To assign a keyboard shortcut for launching <code>dmenu</code>:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc|lang=bash|title=sxhkd configuration file|1=
# program launcher
super + @space
  dmenu_run
}}

=== Terminal emulators ===

==== st aka suckless/simple terminal====

If '''lightweight''' is how you roll, this might be of use

{{USEflag|package=x11-terms/st}}

To install it, just issue the command:

{{Emerge|x11-terms/st}}

To enable a keyboard shortcut for launching the terminal

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc|lang=bash|title=sxhkd configuration file|1=
# terminal emulator
super + Return
  st
}}

==== rxvt-unicode aka urxvt ====

This is another alternative, although it lacks full unicode support and you '''might''' have some issues with Powerline Fonts.

{{USEflag|package=x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}}

You can install it issuing the command:

{{Emerge|x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}}

=== i3lock ===

Locking your screen is always recommended in order to avoid unauthorized access to your Workstation

{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/i3lock}}

You can install it by issuing the command:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/i3lock}}

In order to assign a keyboard shortcut for locking your screen, you should update your configuration file

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc|lang=bash|title=sxhkd configuration file|1=
# lock the screen with dark background
super + q
  i3lock -c 000000
}}
