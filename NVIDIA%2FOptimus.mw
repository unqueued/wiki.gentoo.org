Laptops with NVIDIA graphics cards using NVIDIA Optimus can be configured to
render scenes on the discrete NVIDIA GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) card using
x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers and copy the rendered scenes to the Intel GPU using
XRandR.

{{Note|This article is about native Optimus support using the official NVIDIA drivers ({{package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}) â€“ it is '''not''' about bumblebee; bumblebee is not used in this configuration.}}

== Installation ==

{{Important|In the case that something should go wrong, it is recommended to have live media to assist in reverting any changes. Having a [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/where.xml Gentoo Minimal Install CD], [http://www.sysresccd.org/ SystemRescueCD] (which is a Gentoo based recovery image), or a [[LiveUSB]] around work nicely for this purpose. '''If you choose to proceed without having a "just in case" alternative boot method do so with extreme caution!'''}}

{{Note|At the time this article was written version 346.22 of {{Package|nvidia-drivers}} was the most recent (unstable) version of the driver in the Portage tree, therefore examples that reference a specific version will presume 346.22. When a newer version of the driver is released, or if an older version is selected, simply substitute 346.22 for the desired version.}}

Installing NVIDIA drivers is easy, simply run the following: 

{{Emerge|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}

{{USEflag
|package=x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers
|desc=NVIDIA Acceleated Graphics Driver

== Configuration ==
Configuring a system to use NVIDIA's propritary driver is not easy as the installation. There are several configuration files that will need to be modified in order for a system to work properly.

=== Kernel Configuration ===

Since NVIDIA Optimus will be using the integrated Intel graphics, the following kernel options will need to be enabled:

{{Kernel||<pre>
DeviceDrivers  --->
    Graphics Support  --->
        <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/Gex/G4x/HD Graphics
        [*]   Enable modetting on intel by default
</pre>}}

=== Xorg.conf Configuration ===
The best way to set the system's xorg.conf correctly would be to read the documentation NVIDIA has provided. The documentation can be found in a couple of locations. To save time, consider reading only the pages on Optimus and XRandR, as they are vital to correct configuration. If the driver has already been emerged (done in the installation step above), the documentation can be found locally at {{Path|/usr/share/doc/nvidia-drivers-346.22/README.bz2}}.

Example: Use the less command to read the local documentation:
{{Cmd|less /usr/share/doc/nvidia-drivers-346.22/README.bz2}}

It is also possible to read the documentation at NVIDIA's website by following these (external) links:

http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/346.22/README/optimus.html

http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/346.22/README/randr14.html

=== Using Specific Monitor via EDID ===
It is probably best to first try a simple configuration first like described in the NVIDIA driver manual:

http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/346.22/README/randr14.html

==== Saving the Monitor's EDID ====
Some laptops/notebooks may benefit from saving the EDID screen information to a file so it can be passed to the NVIDIA and Intel modesetting drivers. The EDID information can be saved using the read-edid utility.

{{RootCmd|emerge -v x11-misc/read-edid}}
{{RootCmd|get-edid >/lib/firmware/edid/1920x1080_Clevo_W670SR.bin}}

The EDID information is provided to the Intel GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) by specifying its
location in the kernel boot parameter:

 <nowiki>
drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=edid/1920x1080_clevo_W670SR.bin</nowiki>

If you are using the grub boot loader on Gentoo this can be configured in the file /etc/default/grub:

{{File|/etc/default/grub||<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=edid/1920x1080_clevo_W670SR.bin"
GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080
</pre>}}

Note: On Sabayon linux the kernel boot parameters should be specified in the /etc/default/sabayon-grub file
instead of /etc/default/grub.

==== Example Xorg.conf for EDID ====

See [[NVIDIA_Driver_with_Optimus_Laptops/EDID_Xorg.conf_Example| EDID Xorg.conf Example]] to view an example Xorg.conf using an EDID for a specific monitor.

== Configuration Prior to Starting X ==

Per NVIDIA's [http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/346.22/README/randr14.html instructions], the following commands are required before starting X:

<nowiki>
$ xrandr --setprovideroutputsource modesetting NVIDIA-0
$ xrandr --auto
</nowiki>

This is to say any Display Manager that starts X-Windows then asks the user to log in will result in a black screen unless the above  XRandR commands are run ''before'' asking the user to log in.

{{Warning|The XRandR commands must be added to the system's X session startup scripts (such as ~/.xinitrc) in order for the X display to start using modesetting. Failed to do so will result in a black screen.}}

Use the XRandR command to find the appropriate graphics device:

<nowiki>
$ xrandr --listproviders
</nowiki>

=== Display Manager Configuration ===

==== Qingy ====

{{RootCmd|emerge -v sys-apps/qingy}}

===== For Menu Option (A) KDE-4 =====

Add the XRandR commands to the end of the file: 
<nowiki>
/etc/X11/Sessions/KDE-4
</nowiki>

===== For Menu Option (B) Your .xsession =====

Add the XRandR commands to the file: 
<nowiki>
~/.xsession
</nowiki>

===== Qingy DirectFB =====

In the directfb configuration file: 
<nowiki>
/etc/directfbrc
</nowiki>

It is necessary to set the busid parameter to the BusID of the Intel graphics card as reported by the lspci command:

{{RootCmd|lspci}}

For example, if lspci says the Intel graphics card is on BusID 00:02.0, then add the following line to {{Path}/etc/directfbrc}}

{{File|/etc/directfbrc||<pre>
busid=0:02:0
</pre>}}

==== The Console Display Manager (CDM) ====

{{RootCmd|emerge -v x11-misc/cdm}}

Add the XRandR commands to the file: 
<nowiki>
~/.xinitrc
</nowiki>

==== KDE Display Manager (KDM) ====

{{RootCmd|emerge -v kde-base/kdm}}

Add the XRandR commands to the file: 
<nowiki>
/usr/share/config/kdm/Xsetup
</nowiki>

==== Mint Desktop Manager (MDM) ====
For Mint Desktop Manager fetch the ebuild and install {{Package|gnome-base/mdm}}

{{RootCmd|emerge -v gnome-base/mdm}}

Add the XRandR commands to the file: 
<nowiki>
/etc/X11/mdm/Init/Default
</nowiki>

==== X Display Manager (XDM) ====

Add the XRandR commands to the file: 
<nowiki>
/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0
</nowiki>

If the system is a 32-bit system, modify: 
<nowiki>
/usr/lib64/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0
</nowiki>

If a using a 64-bit system, then modify: 
<nowiki>
/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config
</nowiki>

Edit the follwing line to point to another script that will run the XRandR commands:

<nowiki>
DisplayManager._0.setup: /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0
</nowiki>

== Debugging ==

Since there are so many files to configure, it is rather easy to create a faulty NVIDIA Optimus configuration. It is possible something was typed incorectly, or a certian configuration was not compatable with the hardware being used. Whatever the case, a broken configuration means that debugging is required.

To debug, carefully read the logs from dmesg ({{Path|/var/log/dmesg}}) and Xorg ({{Path|/var/log/Xorg.0.log}}) as they are good indicators to reveal any issues. If something irreglar is discovered, make changes to the respective configuration files. Other areas of inspection for debugging include any of the configuration files modified above (the kernel's .config, kernel boot parameters passed at {{Path|/etc/default/grub}}, the Xorg's {{Path|/etc/X11/xorg.conf}} file, etc.). Continue checking the various files as necessary then reboot the system and try again. Many attempts may be required to obtain a working configuration. It's no fun, and no one enjoys it, but that is part of the joy of learning software!

{{Note|When viewing {{Path|/var/log/Xorg.0.log}} using a text editor such as {{Package|app-editors/vim}}, search for "(EE)" to quickly find errors.}}

To aid in distinguishing between important and unimportant messages in {{Path|/var/log/dmesg}} and {{Path|/var/log/Xorg.0.log}} files, working examples are provided at these sub-articles:
