Laptops with NVIDIA graphics cards using NVIDIA Optimus can be configured to
render scenes on the discrete NVIDIA GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) card using
x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers and copy the rendered scenes to the Intel GPU using
XRandR.

It is recommended to have an alternative boot method available such as bootable
CD-ROM or DVD.

== Kernel configuration ==

Consider setting:

DeviceDrivers -> Graphics Support -> Intel 8xx/9xx/Gex/G4x/HD Graphics -> Enable modetting on intel by default

== xorg.conf configuration ==

== Display Manager configuration ==

=== Qingy ===

emerge -v sys-apps/qingy

==== for menu option (a) KDE-4 ====

Add the xrandr commands to the end of the file:

/etc/X11/Sessions/KDE-4

==== for menu option (b) Your .xsession ====

Add the xrandr commands to the file:

~/.xsession

=== CDM ===

emerge -v x11-misc/cdm

Add the xrandr commands to the file:

~/.xinitrc

=== KDM KDE ===

emerge -v kde-base/kdm

Add the xrandr commands to the file:

/usr/share/config/kdm/Xsetup

=== Other display managers ===

Any Display Manager that starts using X-Windows then asks the user to log in
will result in a black screen unless a way can be found to run the necessary
xrandr commands before asking the user to log in.
