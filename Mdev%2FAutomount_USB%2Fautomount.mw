The following is the ash script {{path|/lib/mdev/autousb/automount}} that is called at least once by the hotplug handler ({{path|/lib/mdev}}) for every insertion/deletion of any peripheral whose devicename matches the pattern {{path|/dev/sd[a-z].*}} . This script is called once for the main device, and once for each partition. E.g. assuming that {{path|/dev/sda}} and {{path|/dev/sdb}} already exist, a USB stick or external drive that has 2 partitions will generate 3 calls...
# one for {{path|/dev/sdc}}
# one for {{path|/dev/sdc1}}
# one for {{path|/dev/sdc2}}
