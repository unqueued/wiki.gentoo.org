The Dell XPS series is widely considered to be quite Linux friendly. Thus, when my second overpriced Macbook Pro in a row developed annoying hardware problems that required spending stupid money to resolve, I determined that I should switch away from OSX and return to the Linux desktop fold.

=== Accessories ===

Some models have touch screens. Some models are 2-in-1 (break apart). I tested on a conventional (non break apart) model with touch screen, however the touch screen has not been tested.

== Installation ==

I wanted to get ZFS root enabled, because from past experience this will save time later. However, the setup is kind of obtuse owing to the need for an initial RAM filesystem (`initramfs`) which creates a bit of a hassle building and upgrading the kernel. The best documentation on this I could find was [https://www.funtoo.org/index.php?title=ZFS_Install_Guide over here at Funtoo].

=== Firmware ===

BIOS version on receipt was <code>1.3.4</code> with <code>ePSA Build 4304.17 UEFI ROM</code>.

=== Kernel ===

Yet to be explored. NVMe support is required to use the hard disk.

== Troubleshooting ==

(Optional section.)

(Troubleshoot issues in this section. Separate issues by best describing the error with a new section name. Remove this section and subsections if no issues are known.)
