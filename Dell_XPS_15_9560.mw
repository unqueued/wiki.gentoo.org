The Dell XPS series is widely considered to be quite Linux friendly. Thus, when my second overpriced Macbook Pro in a row developed annoying hardware problems that required spending stupid money to resolve, I determined that I should switch away from OSX and return to the Linux desktop fold.

=== Accessories ===

Some models have touch screens. Some models are 2-in-1 (break apart). I tested on a conventional (non break apart) model with touch screen, however the touch screen has not been tested.

== Installation ==

=== Goals ===
Why buy new hardware if we aren't going to use the latest and greatest in software features? Therefore, we are going to push the boundaries of the possible by setting up a ZFS root partition, because from past experience this will save time later.

{{Note|ZFS on root setup is kind of obtuse owing to the need for an initial RAM filesystem (`initramfs`) which creates a bit of a hassle building and upgrading the kernel. The best documentation on this I could find was [https://www.funtoo.org/index.php?title=ZFS_Install_Guide over here at Funtoo] so we will essentially attempt to follow that.}}

=== Booting Linux for the First Time ===

{{Warning|All current data on the USB key will be lost!}}
* First create a bootable USB with a ZFS enabled. The easiest way to do this is as follows.
** Install [[UNetbootin]] (from [http://unetbootin.github.io/ its homepage])
** Plug in any USB mass storage device (aka. "usb key") with a decent size (16GB+) that you don't mind wiping (all data current stored on the device will be lost!)
** Start UNetbootin
** Select the latest Ubuntu Live DVD image
** Let UNetbootin download and install it on to the USB mass storage device
** Now you have a bootable Linux mass storage device with ZFS support 
* Turn on the Dell XPS 15 9560 laptop and press F2 repeatedly. This will take you to BIOS.
** Disable secure boot
** Enable legacy boot
** Switch the NVMe internal flash unit to AHCI mode
** Plug in your bootable Linux mass storage device with ZFS support
** Save changes and exit
* The system will boot to Linux for the first time
 
=== Firmware ===

BIOS version on receipt was <code>1.3.4</code> with <code>ePSA Build 4304.17 UEFI ROM</code>.

=== Kernel ===

Yet to be explored. NVMe support is required to use the hard disk.

=== Emerge ===

(Optional section. If the platform requires any user space packages or kernel patches, mention them here).

== Configuration ==

(Explain any additional configuration or special customization for this hardware platform. Could be anything from BIOS settings to assigning proper media key functionality.)

=== Example 1 ===

(Example: Do this in order to get these keys working.)

== Troubleshooting ==

(Optional section.)

(Troubleshoot issues in this section. Separate issues by best describing the error with a new section name. Remove this section and subsections if no issues are known.)

=== Issue 1 ===

When X happens, Y is how you fix it.

== External resources ==

(Optional section.)

* (Link to external resources (outside the Wiki) using bullet points in this section. It is common for the information in this section to full sentences that are links.)
