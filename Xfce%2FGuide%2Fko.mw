이 안내서는 빠르고, 가벼우며 완벽한 기능을 갖춘 데스크톱 환경 XFCE를 자세하게 소개합니다.

== 도입부 ==

=== Xfce 데스크톱 환경 ===

[http://www.xfce.org Xfce] 은 유닉스 계열 운영체제용 빠르고 가벼운 데스크톱 환경입니다. 생산성에 역점을 두어 설계했으며 [http://www.freedesktop.org Freedesktop] 명세에 따라 상당 부분을 설정할 수 있습니다. 

 [http://www.gnome.org Gnome]과 [http://www.kde.org KDE] 같은 거대 규모 데스크톱과는 달리 Xfce는 상당히 적은 시스템 자원을 활용합니다. 게다가 굉장한 모듈화와 적은 의존성을 지니고 있습니다. 하드 디스크 공간을 적게 차지하며 설치에 적은 시간이 걸립니다. 

이 안내서에는 최소한의 Xfce 환경에 대한 설치 설정만 보여주는 것이 아니라, "가벼움, 빠름, 모듈화" Xfce 철학에 따른 완전한 기능을 갖춘 데스크톱을 만드는 옵션을 살펴보기도 합니다. 

이 안내서의 마지막 부분에는 새 Xfce 릴리즈로 업그레이드 한 후 실행할 약간의 명령을 보여주므로, 이전 버전에서 업그레이드 할 경우 해당 명령 절차를 따랐는지 확인하십시오. 

== Xfce 설치 ==

=== 기본 ===

먼저 [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration X Server Configuration Howto]에 따라 Xorg를 설정했는지 확인하십시오 

다음 {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}의 USE 플래그를 다시금 확인하십시오. 최소한 <code>USE="-gnome -kde -minimal -qt4 dbus jpeg lock session startup-notification thonar udev X"</code> 정도는 원할 것입니다. 

이제 {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}의 <code>USE</code> 변수 값을 설정하였다면, Xfce를 설치할 때입니다. 

{{Emerge|xfce4-meta}}

다음 일반 사용자를 <code>cdrom</code>, <code>cdrw</code>, <code>usb</code> 그룹에 추가하여 카메라, 광 드라이브, USB 메모리를 마운트하고 사용할 수 있도록 하십시오. 

{{RootCmd|for x in cdrom cdrw usb ; do gpasswd -a username $x ; done}}

다음 환경 변수를 업데이트하십시오: 

{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

그래픽 터미널을 필요로 하며 새 데스크톱 환경에서 계속 작업을 하고 싶으실 것입니다. Xfce에 맞추려면 <code>x11-terms/xfce4-terminal</code>가 적절할 것입니다. 터미널 설치는 다음과 같습니다: 

{{Emerge|x11-terms/xfce4-terminal}}

== Xfce 설정 ==

=== Xfce 시작 ===

이제 Xfce를 설치했고, <code>startx</code> 명령을 실행했을 때의 기본 데스크톱 환경을 설정하겠습니다. 루트 쉘에서 빠져나가고 일반 사용자로 로그온 하십시오. 

{{Cmd|echo "exec startxfce4" > ~/.xinitrc}}

{{Note/ko|ConsoleKit을 설치하지 않았으면, {{Path|~/.xinitrc}}를 대신 <code>exec startxfce4 --with-ck-launch</code>에 넣어야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 일부 프로그램의 동작이 멈추게 됩니다. 또한 다음 명령을 루트 권한으로 실행하도록 기본 런레벨에 추가해야 합니다: <code>rc-update add consolekit default</code>.}}

이제 <code>startx</code>를 입력하여 그래픽 환경을 시작하십시오: 

{{Cmd|startx}}

새 Xfce 데스크톱 환경으로의 진입을 축하하며 환경합니다. 이제 이리저리 둘러보십시오. 여러분이 필요로 하는 요건을 맞추려 Xfce 설정을 어떻게 할 수 있는지 배우기 위해 계속 읽어내려가십시오. 

=== 세션과 시동 ===

이미 <code>k3b</code>, <code>nautilus</code>, <code>kmail</code>, <code>evolution</code> 과 같은 그놈이나 KDE 프로그램을 설치했다면 (또는 할 생각이 있다면) Xfce가 시작시에 이들 프로그램을 실행하기 위한 적당한 서비스를 실행했는지 확인해야 합니다. 메뉴 -> 설정 -> 세션 및 시동으로 이동하십시오. "고급" 탭을 보시고 적당한 확인상자를 선택하십시오. Xfce 시동 시간이 좀 길어질 수 있지만 KDE와 그놈 프로그램의 불러오기 시간은 감소시킵니다. 

Xfce는 세션 및 시동 메뉴의 "일반" 탭에서 세션 설정과 실행중인 프로그램을 저장하는 기능을 갖추고 있습니다. 로그아웃히  자동으로 저장하거나 Xfce가 각각의 순간마다 물어보도록 할 수 있습니다. 이 기능은 잘못된 설정을 되돌릴때 유용합니다. 실수로 패널을 죽였습니까? 현재 세션에서  저장하겠느냐는 물음에 그냥 "아니요"라고 하시면 다음 Xfce 시작할 때 이전 데스크톱을 복구합니다. 다음에 로그인할 때 웹 브라우저, 터미널, 전자메일 클라이언트를 자동으로 실행하겠습니까? 로그아웃 전에 세션을 저장하기만 하십시오. 

You've now got a basic working environment installed and configured. But if you're interested in doing more, then continue reading! 

== Additional Applications ==

=== Panel plugins ===

In this chapter, we'll discuss some useful plugins and applications for everyday use within Xfce. 

There are many plugins for the panel available in Portage; see for yourself with <code>emerge --search xfce</code> . Though for the most part their names are self-explanatory, a few deserve extra attention, as they are quite helpful. To use them, simply <code>emerge</code> them. They'll be added to the list of available items in the "Add New Items" menu shown when you right-click on the panel. 

*  <code>xfce4-battery-plugin</code> is perfect for laptop users. It displays battery percentage, time remaining, power source (AC or battery), fan status, warnings, and can even be configured to execute commands at certain power levels. This feature can be used to put the laptop into hibernate mode when the battery is almost exhausted.
*  <code>xfce4-verve-plugin</code> is a small command line embedded into the panel. It's quicker than opening up another terminal when you want to run a command.
*  <code>xfce4-mount-plugin</code> gives you a handy method of mounting devices listed in {{Path|/etc/fstab}} just by clicking your mouse
*  <code>xfce4-sensors-plugin</code> lets you monitor your hardware sensors, such as CPU temperature, fan RPM, hard drive temp, motherboard voltage, and more

=== Useful programs ===

We should now <code>emerge</code> some useful applications and utilities: <code>xfce4-mixer</code> , <code>xfce4-taskmanager</code> , <code>xfwm4-themes</code> , <code>orage</code> , <code>mousepad</code> , <code>xfce4-power-manager</code> , <code>x11-terms/xfce4-terminal</code> , and <code>thunar</code> . 

<code>xfce4-mixer</code> is a volume control for your sound card. It can also be run as a panel applet, giving you fast access to playback volume.<code>xfce4-taskmanager</code> displays a list of all running programs, and the CPU and memory consumption each one takes up. By right-clicking an item, you can kill a misbehaving application, pause and restart it, or even alter its runtime priority, which lets you fine-tune how much of a demand it puts on your system's resources. 

<code>xfwm4-themes</code> adds several window manager themes. You may want to add a more full-coverage icon theme such as<code>tango-icon-theme</code> just to round out your desktop. 

<code>orage</code> is a simple, handy calendar.<code>mousepad</code> is a barebones text editor that starts up extremely quickly. 

<code>xfce4-power-manager</code> is an application to monitor and manage power usage. This is especially important for laptops! The power manager allows you to adjust screen brightness, choose maximum performance or battery-saving modes, and setup hibernate, suspend, and shutdown actions when the lid is shut or buttons are pressed. You can set[http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/xfce4-power-manager xfce4-power-manager] to warn you when your battery reaches certain levels, or even turn off your machine. The application comes with a couple of helpful panel plugins to display battery/charging status, and a brightness control. 

<code>x11-terms/xfce4-terminal</code> is an X11 terminal emulator, far more configurable and useful than the barebones<code>xterm</code> .<code>xfce4-terminal</code> supports Unicode text, color schemes, pseudo-transparency and hardware-accelerated transparency via Xfce's built-in compositor, all out-of-the-box. Just make sure that the default action on the terminal launcher of your panel runs {{Path|/usr/bin/Terminal}} instead of {{Path|xterm}} . Right-click the launcher and choose "Properties" to change the command. 

<code>thunar</code> is Xfce's default graphical file manager. It's fast yet quite powerful, can support several plugins for even more functionality; just install them with<code>emerge</code> . Let's take a look: 

*  <code>thunar-archive-plugin</code> lets you create and extract archive files using the right-click menu. It provides a handy [http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/thunar-plugins/thunar-archive-plugin front-end] for graphical archiving applications such as <code>xarchiver</code> and <code>file-roller</code> .
*  <code>tumbler</code> lets you preview certain types of files from within Thunar, such as images and fonts.
*  <code>thunar-volman</code> automatically [http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/thunar-plugins/thunar-volman manages] removable media and drives.

Next, let's see about adding some useful but lightweight desktop applications, in keeping with Xfce's philosophy. 

Though <code>mousepad</code> is nice enough as a basic text editor, if you need a full-featured word processor but don't want the bloat of LibreOffice, try emerging <code>abiword</code> . [http://www.abisource.com AbiWord] is lighter, faster, and is completely interoperable with industry-standard document types. 

Need a nice email client/newsreader that isn't as demanding as <code>thunderbird</code> or <code>evolution</code> ? Try emerging <code>claws-mail</code> . 

For your internet chat needs, <code>irssi</code> is an excellent, tiny, incredibly configurable IRC client that runs in your terminal. If you prefer a compact all-in-one client that handles nearly all chat protocols, you may want to <code>emerge pidgin</code> . 

If you need movie and music players, look no further than <code>mplayer</code> and [http://www.gentoo.org//proj/en/desktop/sound/decibel.xml decibel-audio-player] . They can play most every media format available quite nicely. 

Finally, you'll need a webbrowser. Nearly all graphical webbrowsers require more resources than most of your other desktop applications. Still, <code>firefox</code> and <code>midori</code> are always good choices. Alternatively, you may find <code>opera</code> to be quite fast. However, <code>opera</code> is not available on as many processor architectures as <code>firefox</code> , and it has more dependencies unless you override them with a few USE flags. 

{{Emerge|firefox}}

{{Emerge|midori}}

{{RootCmd|echo "www-client/opera gtk -kde" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{Emerge|opera}}

Now that we've explored some good suggestions for rounding out your desktop applications, let's see what else we can do to enhance your Xfce experience. 

=== Graphical login ===

Remember when we added <code>startxfce4</code> to our {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} ? All you have to do to get into your desktop is type <code>startx</code> after logging in. This is fine if you prefer a completely text-based boot and login, but let's use a display manager that will automatically start Xfce after booting (so that you can login graphically). 

First, let's make sure Xfce loads at boot: 

{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

We aren't quite finished yet. We have to pick a display manager and set the appropriate variable. Though there are a few choices available in Portage, for this guide, we'll stick with [http://slim.berlios.de SLiM] , the Simple Login Manager. 

<code>slim</code> is speedy and lightweight, with minimal dependencies. Perfect for Xfce! 

{{Emerge|x11-misc/slim}}

{{Note|The <code>branding</code> USE flag will pull in the <code>slim-themes</code> package, which will give you an assortment of login themes, including a Gentoo Linux theme.}}

Then edit the DISPLAYMANAGER variable in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/xdm}} : 

{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
DISPLAYMANAGER="slim"
</pre>
}}

SLiM can automatically start your Xfce session if you add <code>XSESSION="Xfce4"</code> to {{Path|/etc/env.d/90xsession}} : 

{{RootCmd|echo XSESSION{{=}}\"Xfce4\" > /etc/env.d/90xsession
|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

=== Beautifying your desktop ===

A little customization of your desktop's appearance can go a long way. Xfce has all the options you'd expect from a modern desktop environment, font antialiasing settings, color schemes, dozens of window decorations, themes, and more. If these aren't enough, it's easy to install third-party themes, icon sets, mouse cursor themes, and wallpapers. 

A selection of nice Gentoo wallpapers in a variety of resolutions are hosted on the [http://www.gentoo.org//main/en/graphics.xml Gentoo website] . If you're looking for icon sets and complete Xfce themes, [http://www.xfce-look.org/ Xfce-Look] has a huge collection. The important thing to remember about any third-party eyecandy you download is that it will usually first need to be unpacked and then installed to the proper directory. Icon sets go in {{Path|/usr/share/icons/}} , and themes go to {{Path|/usr/share/themes/}} ; use these directories when you want all users to be able to access themes and icon sets. Individual users can install themes and icon sets to {{Path|~/.themes/}} and {{Path|~/.icons/}} . 

If you installed SLiM as your display manager, there are lots of themes in the <code>slim-themes</code> package available in Portage. Also, be sure to check the SLiM [http://slim.berlios.de/themes01.php themes page] for more themes. Creating your own SLiM theme is fairly easy; just read the [http://slim.berlios.de/themes_howto.php Themes HowTo] . Gentoo also ships a <code>slim-themes</code> package that you can <code>emerge</code> . 

Finally, Xfce has its own built-in compositor to manage window transparency. This option can be found in Menu --> Settings --> Window Manager. For best performance, you will need to be running a graphics card with drivers that support hardware-accelerated rendering. Make sure you emerged <code>xfwm4</code> with the <code>xcomposite</code> USE flag. Next, you will need to enable compositing in {{Path|/etc/X11/xorg.conf}} by adding the following section: 

{{File|xorg.conf|Enabling composite|<pre>
Section "Extensions"
    Option  "Composite"  "Enable"
EndSection
</pre>
}}

This is the bare minimum configuration required for Xfce and Xorg-X11. However, setting up hardware-accelerated rendering depends on your individual graphics card, and is beyond the scope of this guide. Please see the other guides in the [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/index.xml?catid=desktop Desktop Documentation Resources] list to learn about configuring hardware-accelerated rendering for your graphics card. 

Once you've finished setting up a beautiful Xfce desktop, the next thing to do is take a picture of it to share with other folks! Just install <code>xfce4-screenshooter</code> and post your pictures somewhere for all to admire. 

== Summary ==

Congratulations on making it this far! You've installed and configured a speedy desktop environment with a solid suite of applications for your computing needs. 

=== Upgrading Xfce ===

If you're upgrading Xfce from earlier major versions (4.x), then you will need to remove your old cached sessions and profiles as they are incompatible with new releases. For each of your users, run the following commands to remove your old incompatible cached sessions and profile: 

{{RootCmd|rm -r ~/.cache/sessions
|rm -r ~/.config/xfce*
|rm -r ~/.config/Thunar}}

Users will be greeted with a new and shiny interface, but will lose many of their individual settings. Sadly, no migration of configuration(s) exist that we know of.
