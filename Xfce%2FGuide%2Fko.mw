이 안내서는 빠르고, 가벼우며 완벽한 기능을 갖춘 데스크톱 환경 XFCE를 자세하게 소개합니다.

== 도입부 ==

=== Xfce 데스크톱 환경 ===

[http://www.xfce.org Xfce] 은 유닉스 계열 운영체제용 빠르고 가벼운 데스크톱 환경입니다. 생산성에 역점을 두어 설계했으며 [http://www.freedesktop.org Freedesktop] 명세에 따라 상당 부분을 설정할 수 있습니다. 

Unlike heavier desktop environments, such as [http://www.gnome.org Gnome] and [http://www.kde.org KDE], Xfce uses far fewer system resources. Additionally, it offers greater modularity and fewer dependencies; it takes up less space on your hard disk and takes less time to install. 

이 안내서에는 최소한의 Xfce 환경에 대한 설치 설정만 보여주는 것이 아니라, "가벼움, 빠름, 모듈화" Xfce 철학에 따른 완전한 기능을 갖춘 데스크톱을 만드는 옵션을 살펴보기도 합니다. 

이 안내서의 마지막 부분에는 새 Xfce 릴리즈로 업그레이드 한 후 실행할 약간의 명령을 보여주므로, 이전 버전에서 업그레이드 할 경우 해당 명령 절차를 따랐는지 확인하십시오. 

== Installation ==

=== 기본 ===

First make sure Xorg has been configured as instructed in the [[Xorg/Guide|Xorg Guide]]. If these steps have not been completed the rest of this guide will not apply as expected.

Next, double-check the USE flags in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}; most users will want to set the following:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Common USE flags settings for Xfce|lang=bash|1=
USE="-gnome -kde -minimal -qt4 dbus jpeg lock session startup-notification thunar udev X"
}}

=== Emerge ===

Now that the <code>USE</code> variables have been set in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}, it is time to install Xfce. 

{{Emerge|xfce-base/xfce4-meta}}

If desired add regular user(s) to the <code>cdrom</code>, <code>cdrw</code>, and <code>usb</code> groups, so that they can mount and use devices such as cameras, optical drives, and USB sticks.

{{RootCmd|for x in cdrom cdrw usb ; do gpasswd -a username $x ; done}}

Update the system's environment variables: 

{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

A graphical terminal will be needed to continue working in the new desktop environment. The {{Package|x11-terms/xfce4-terminal}} package is a good choice; it is made specifically for Xfce. Install Terminal as shown: 

{{Emerge|x11-terms/xfce4-terminal}}

== Configuration ==

=== Xfce 시작 ===

Now that Xfce is now installed, we'll configure it to be the default desktop environment when we issue the <tt>startx</tt> command. Exit your root shell and log on as a regular user. 

{{Cmd|echo "exec startxfce4" > ~/.xinitrc}}

{{Note|If you have ConsoleKit installed, your {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} should instead contain <tt>exec startxfce4 --with-ck-launch</tt>. Otherwise, some of your applications may stop working. You'll also need to add consolekit to the default runlevel by running the following command as root: <tt>rc-update add consolekit default</tt>.}}

Now start your graphical environment by typing <tt>startx</tt>: 

{{Cmd|startx}}

새 Xfce 데스크톱 환경으로의 진입을 축하하며 환경합니다. 이제 이리저리 둘러보십시오. 여러분이 필요로 하는 요건을 맞추려 Xfce 설정을 어떻게 할 수 있는지 배우기 위해 계속 읽어내려가십시오. 

=== Sessions and startup ===

If you've installed (or plan to install) popular Gnome or KDE applications such as <tt>k3b</tt>, <tt>nautilus</tt>, <tt>kmail</tt>, <tt>evolution</tt>, etc. then you should make sure that Xfce launches the appropriate services for these at startup. Navigate to {{Path|Menu --> Settings --> Sessions & Startup}}. On the {{Path|Advanced}} tab, select the appropriate checkbox. This might slightly increase Xfce startup times, but it decreases load times for KDE and Gnome applications. 

Xfce has the ability to save your session settings and running programs from the {{Path|General}} tab in the {{Path|Sessions & Startup}} menu. They can be automatically saved when you logout, or Xfce can ask you each time. This feature is particularly useful for undoing configuration mistakes. Accidentally killed a panel? Just select "No" when prompted to save your current session, and the next time you start Xfce, your old desktop is restored. Want to automatically launch your open web browser, terminal, and email client the next time you login? Just save your session before logging out. 

이제 설치하고 설정한 환경의 기본 동작이 어떻게 되는지를 아셨습니다. 그런데, 더 뭘 할 수 있는가에 대해 관심이 있으시다고요? 계속 읽어내려가보십시오! 

=== Additional applications ===

Every user should consider installing some or all of the following useful applications and utilities:

{{Emerge|xfce-extra/xfce4-mixer xfce-extra/xfce4-taskmanager x11-themes/xfwm4-themes app-office/orage app-editors/mousepad xfce-extra/xfce4-power-manager x11-terms/xfce4-terminal xfce-base/thunar}}

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|-
! Package 
! Description
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-mixer}}
| A volume control for your sound card. It can also be run as a panel applet, giving you fast access to playback volume. {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-taskmanager}} displays a list of all running programs, and the CPU and memory consumption each one takes up. By right-clicking an item, you can kill a misbehaving application, pause and restart it, or even alter its run time priority, which lets you fine-tune how much of a demand it puts on your system's resources. 
|-
| {{Package|x11-themes/xfwm4-themes}}
| Adds several window manager themes. You may want to add a more full-coverage icon theme such as {{Package|x11-themes/tango-icon-theme}} just to round out your desktop. 
|-
| {{Package|app-office/orage}}
| A simple, handy calendar. {{Package|app-editors/mousepad}} is a bare bones text editor that starts up extremely quickly. 
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-power-manager}}
| An application to monitor and manage power usage. This is especially important for laptops! The power manager allows user to adjust screen brightness, choose maximum performance or battery-saving modes, and setup hibernate, suspend, and shutdown actions when the lid is shut or buttons are pressed. [http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/xfce4-power-manager xfce4-power-manager] can be set to provide warning when the battery reaches certain levels, or even turn off the machine. The application comes with a couple of helpful panel plugins to display battery/charging status, and a brightness control. 
|-
| {{Package|x11-terms/xfce4-terminal}}
| An X11 terminal emulator, far more configurable and useful than the barebones<code>xterm</code>. xfce4-terminal supports Unicode text, color schemes, pseudo-transparency and hardware-accelerated transparency via Xfce's built-in compositor, all out-of-the-box. Just make sure that the default action on the terminal launcher of your panel runs {{Path|/usr/bin/Terminal}} instead of <tt>xterm</tt>. Right-click the launcher and choose {{Path|Properties}} to change the command. 
|-
| {{Package|xfce-base/thunar}}
| Xfce's default graphical file manager. It is fast yet quite powerful, can support several plugins for even more functionality; just install them with <tt>emerge</tt>. These plugins include: {{Package|xfce-extra/thunar-archive-plugin}} which lets users create and extract archive files using the right-click menu. It provides a handy [http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/thunar-plugins/thunar-archive-plugin front-end] for graphical archiving applications such as <tt>xarchiver</tt> and <tt>file-roller</tt>.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/tumbler}}
| Lets users preview certain types of files from within Thunar, such as images and fonts.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/thunar-volman}}
| Automatically [http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/thunar-plugins/thunar-volman manages] removable media and drives.
|}
 
==== Desktop applications ====

Next, let's see about adding some useful but lightweight desktop applications, staying with Xfce's philosophy. 

Though {{Package|app-editors/mousepad}} is nice enough as a basic text editor, if you need a full-featured word processor but don't want the bloat of LibreOffice, try emerging {{Package|app-office/abiword}}. [http://www.abisource.com AbiWord] is lighter, faster, and is completely inter-operable with industry-standard document types. 

Need a nice email client/newsreader that is not as demanding as {{Package|mail-client/thunderbird}} or {{Package|mail-client/evolution}}? Try emerging {{Package|mail-client/claws-mail}}. 

For your internet chat needs, {{Package|net-irc/irssi}} is an excellent, tiny, incredibly configurable IRC client that runs in your terminal. If you prefer a compact all-in-one client that handles nearly all chat protocols, you may want to <tt>emerge</tt> {{Package|net-im/pidgin}}. 

If you need movie and music players, look no further than {{Package|media-video/mplayer}} and [http://www.gentoo.org//proj/en/desktop/sound/decibel.xml decibel-audio-player]. They can play most every media format available quite nicely. 

Finally, you'll need a web browser. Nearly all graphical web browsers require more resources than most of your other desktop applications. Still, Firefox and Medori are always good choices. Alternatively, you may find Opera to be quite fast. However, Opera is not available on as many processor architectures as Firefox, and it has more dependencies unless you override them with a few USE flags. 

{{Emerge|www-client/firefox}}

{{Emerge|www-client/midori}}

{{RootCmd|echo "www-client/opera gtk -kde" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{Emerge|www-client/opera}}

이제 데스크톱을 다듬는데 몇가지 괜찮은 제안을 확인해보았으니 Xfce 경험 디자인을 개선할 다른 방법을 살펴보도록 하겠습니다. 

==== Panel plugins ====

이 챕터에서는, Xfce에서 매일 사용할 쓸모있는 플러그인과 프로그램에 대해 이야기하도록 하겠습니다. 

There are many plugins for the panel available in Portage; see for yourself with <tt>emerge --search xfce</tt>. Though for the most part their names are self-explanatory, a few deserve extra attention, as they are quite helpful. To use them, simply <tt>emerge</tt> them. They'll be added to the list of available items in the {{Path|Add New Items}} menu shown when you right-click on the panel. 

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|-
! Package
! Description
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-battery-plugin}}
| Perfect for laptop users. It displays battery percentage, time remaining, power source (AC or battery), fan status, warnings, and can even be configured to execute commands at certain power levels. This feature can be used to put the laptop into hibernate mode when the battery is almost exhausted.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-verve-plugin}}
| A small command line embedded into the panel. It is quicker than opening up a terminal to run a command.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-mount-plugin}}
| Provides a handy method of mounting devices listed in {{Path|/etc/fstab}} just by clicking the mouse.
|-
| {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-sensors-plugin}}
| Lets users monitor hardware sensors, such as CPU temperature, fan RPM, hard drive temp, motherboard voltage, and more.
|}

=== 그래픽 로그인 ===

Remember when the {{c|startxfce4}} line was added to the {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} file? All you have to do to get into your desktop is type {{c|startx}} after logging in. This is fine if you prefer a completely text-based boot and login, but let's use a display manager that will automatically start Xfce after booting (so that you can login graphically). 

먼저 Xfce를 부팅할때 불러오는지 확인해보도록 하겠습니다: 

{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

We aren't quite finished yet. We have to pick a display manager and set the appropriate variable. Though there are a few choices available in Portage, for this guide, we'll stick with [[SLiM]], the Simple Login Manager. 

{{Package|x11-misc/slim}} is speedy and lightweight, with minimal dependencies. Perfect for Xfce! 

{{Emerge|x11-misc/slim}}

{{Note|The <code>branding</code> USE flag will pull in the {{Package|x11-themes/slim-themes}} package, which will give you an assortment of login themes, including a Gentoo Linux theme.}}

Then edit the <code>DISPLAYMANAGER</code> variable in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/xdm}}: 

{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
DISPLAYMANAGER="slim"
</pre>
}}

SLiM can automatically start your Xfce session if you add <code>XSESSION="Xfce4"</code> to {{Path|/etc/env.d/90xsession}}: 

{{RootCmd|echo XSESSION{{=}}\"Xfce4\" > /etc/env.d/90xsession
|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

=== Beautifying the desktop ===

A little customization of the desktop's appearance can go a long way. Xfce has all the options one would expect from a modern desktop environment, font anti-aliasing settings, color schemes, dozens of window decorations, themes, and more. If these are not enough, it is easy to install third-party themes, icon sets, mouse cursor themes, and wallpapers. 

A selection of nice Gentoo wallpapers in a variety of resolutions are hosted on the [https://www.gentoo.org/inside-gentoo/artwork/#wallpapers Gentoo website]. When looking for icon sets and complete Xfce themes, [http://www.xfce-look.org/ Xfce-Look] has a huge collection. The important thing to remember about any third-party eye candy is that it will usually need to be unpacked and then installed to the proper directory. Icon sets go in {{Path|/usr/share/icons/}}, and themes go to {{Path|/usr/share/themes/}}; use these directories for all users to be able to access themes and icon sets. Individual users can install themes and icon sets to their home directories in {{Path|~/.themes/}} and {{Path|~/.icons/}}. 

If SLiM  has been installed as the display manager, there are lots of themes in the {{Package|x11-themes/slim-themes}} package available in the main Gentoo repository. Also, be sure to check the SLiM [http://slim.berlios.de/themes01.php themes page] for more themes. Creating your own SLiM theme is fairly easy; just read the [http://slim.berlios.de/themes_howto.php Themes HowTo].

Finally, Xfce has its own built-in compositor to manage window transparency. This option can be found in {{Path|Menu --> Settings --> Window Manager}}. For best performance, you will need to be running a graphics card with drivers that support hardware-accelerated rendering. Make sure the {{Package|xfce-base/xfwm4}} package has been emerged with the <code>xcomposite</code> USE flag, then enable compositing in {{Path|/etc/X11/xorg.conf}} by adding the following section: 

{{File|xorg.conf|화면 합성 활성화|<pre>
Section "Extensions"
    Option  "Composite"  "Enable"
EndSection
</pre>
}}

This is the bare minimum configuration required for Xfce and Xorg-X11. However, setting up hardware-accelerated rendering depends on the system's graphics card, and is beyond the scope of this guide. Please see the other guides in the [[Project:Desktop|Desktop resources]] to learn about configuring hardware-accelerated rendering for various graphic cards. 

Once finished setting up a beautiful Xfce desktop, the next thing to do is take a screenshot of it to share with other folks! Install {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-screenshooter}} and post the pictures somewhere for all to admire.

=== Summary ===

여기까지 참 많은 일들로 고생하셨습니다! 컴퓨터로 일을 하는데 필요한 견고한 프로그램 모음을 갖추어 빠른 데스크톱 환경을 설치하고 설정했습니다.

== Upgrading ==

When upgrading Xfce from earlier major versions (4.x), the old cached sessions and profiles will need to be removed; they are incompatible with new releases. For each user, run the following commands to remove the old incompatible cached sessions and profile: 

{{RootCmd|rm -r ~/.cache/sessions
|rm -r ~/.config/xfce*
|rm -r ~/.config/Thunar}}

Users will be greeted with a new and shiny interface, but will lose many of their individual settings. Sadly, no migration of configuration(s) exist... 

== External resources ==

Xfce를 설정하고 사용하는데 더 많은 도움이 필요합니까? 더 가벼운 프로그램이 필요합니까? 다음을 고려해보십시오: 

* [http://forums.gentoo.org The Gentoo forums]
* The installed help files and other documentation provided by Xfce: {{Path|/usr/share/xfce4/doc/C/index.html}}. Just point your browser at it and start reading. There are even a lot of "hidden" configuration options detailed in the help files.
