These days, with digital storage cheaper than ever, and people accumulating increasing amounts of invaluable digital data (e.g., family videos), there is no excuse not to have a backup regime in case of hardware failure.  

This article describes a simple automated backup scheme using the tool '''[http://www.rsnapshot.org rsnapshot]''', which is based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync rsync].  ''rsnapshot'' makes a specified number of incremental backups of specified filetrees, using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link hard links] to save space on the backup medium.

==Setup==
===Preliminaries===
* Install {{package|app-backup/rsnapshot}}

* Add an entry like the following in your ''fstab'':
{{file|/etc/fstab||<pre>/dev/disk/by-label/backup    /mnt/backup    ext4    noatime,noauto    0 0</pre>}}
In this example, the filesystem is ''ext4'', identified by the label ''backup'', and attaches to a special mount point ''/mnt/backup''.  The ''noauto'' option means that this backup filesystem will not be mounted by default.

===Cron scripts===
Create [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron cron] scripts for the different backup intervals:
{{file|/etc/cron.daily/rsnapshot.daily||<pre>#!/bin/sh

echo "### RSNAPSHOT DAILY ###"
mount /mnt/backup && rsnapshot -c /etc/rsnapshot.d/daily.conf daily || echo "Backup failure"
umount /mnt/backup
echo
</pre>
}}
{{file|/etc/cron.weekly/rsnapshot.weekly||<pre>#!/bin/sh

echo "### RSNAPSHOT WEEKLY ###"
mount /mnt/backup && rsnapshot -c /etc/rsnapshot.d/weekly.conf daily || echo "Backup failure"
umount /mnt/backup
echo
</pre>
}}
{{file|/etc/cron.monthly/rsnapshot.monthly||<pre>#!/bin/sh

echo "### RSNAPSHOT MONTHLY ###"
mount /mnt/backup && rsnapshot -c /etc/rsnapshot.d/monthly.conf daily || echo "Backup failure"
umount /mnt/backup
echo
</pre>
}}
{{note|These scripts must be executable.}}

===rsnapshot configuration files===
Set up the ''rsnapshot'' configuration files referred to in the scripts above.  
{{Note|''rsnapshot'' configuration files are '''tab delimited'''. Be careful to always use tabs instead of spaces for the options.}}
{{Note|Filetree specifications are in ''rsync'' format.  See the ''rsync'' [[man page]] for details.}}
First a base configuration:
{{file|/etc/rsnapshot.d/base.conf||
<pre>
# Default config version
config_version	1.2

# So the hard disk is not polluted in case the backup filesystem is not available
no_create_root	1

# Standard settings
cmd_cp			/bin/cp
cmd_rm			/bin/rm
cmd_rsync		/usr/bin/rsync
link_dest		1

# For convenience, so that mount points can be taken as backup starting points
one_fs			1

# Store all backups in one directory per machine
# A useful alternative may be to create a separate directory for each interval
snapshot_root   /mnt/backup/
</pre>
}}
Then, here are sample configuration files for daily, weekly and monthly backups:
{{file|/etc/rsnapshot.d/daily.conf||
<pre>
include_conf   /etc/rsnapshot.d/base.conf

# Daily (30 increments)
retain	daily	30
backup		/home/me/		localhost/
</pre>
}}

{{file|/etc/rsnapshot.d/weekly.conf||
<pre>
include_conf   /etc/rsnapshot.d/base.conf

# Weekly (12 increments)
retain	weekly	12
backup		/etc/			localhost/
backup		/var/db/pkg/world	localhost/
backup		/boot/			localhost/
</pre>
}}

{{file|/etc/rsnapshot.d/monthly.conf||
<pre>
include_conf   /etc/rsnapshot.d/base.conf

# Monthly (6 increments)
retain	monthly	6
exclude		/home/me/
exclude		/tmp/**
exclude		/usr/portage/distfiles/**
exclude		/boot/
exclude		/home/scratch/**
exclude		/var/tmp/ccache/**
backup		/			localhost/
</pre>
}}
In these files, the second argument of ''backup'' specifies a container directory for the backups, usually referring to the machine (in this case, ''localhost'').  This can be changed to any name of your choosing.

==Restoration==
To restore the ''localhost'' backups specified above, we would use
{{RootCmd|mount /mnt/backup
|rsync -a /mnt/backup/localhost/monthly.0/ /mnt/myroot/
|rsync -a /mnt/backup/localhost/weekly.0/ /mnt/myroot/
|rsync -a /mnt/backup/localhost/daily.0/ /mnt/myroot/}}
where ''/mnt/myroot'' is the mount point of the fresh root filesystem. In the paths above ''*.0'' refers to the latest increment.

==Possible improvements==
It is also possible to make remote backups via '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync rsync]''' or '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell SSH]''' -- see the ''rsnapshot'' man page for details.

=== BTRFS snapshots ===
If you are crazy enough to use btrfs you can leverage its snapshot feature with rsnapshot. Walter Werther has a guide on this: [http://wwerther.de/2011/10/migrate-rsnapshot-based-backup-to-btrfs-snapshots/]
