Usually, the X11 session is started by a [[Display manager]]. However, when running a single-user system you may find display managers an unnecessary waste of resources. Fortunately, you can start X11 session without a display manager.

== Starting X11 from console ==
=== Using startx ===

The standard X11 distribution contains ''startx'', a small script which can be used to start X11 session from a terminal (it's installed by {{Package|x11-apps/xinit}}).

In order to start X11 this way, type in:

{{Cmd|startx}}

This will start the X11 server with default options and try to find an X11 session (e.g. a desktop environment) to start.

If you'd like to specify the session (program to start) yourself, you can do so as an argument to startx:

{{Cmd|startx /usr/bin/startxfce4}}

You can also pass X11 server options, by preceding them with a double dash:

{{Cmd|startx -- vt7}}


=== Using a dedicated session runner ===

Some of the desktop environments provide their own replacements for ''startx''. For example, Xfce4 provides ''startxfce4'':

{{Cmd|startxfce4 -- vt7}}
