Usually, the X11 session is started by a [[Display manager]]. However, when running a single-user system you may find display managers an unnecessary waste of resources. Fortunately, you can start X11 session without a display manager.

== Starting X11 from console ==
=== Using startx ===

The standard X11 distribution contains ''startx'', a small script which can be used to start X11 session from a terminal (it's installed by {{Package|x11-apps/xinit}}).

In order to start X11 this way, type in:

{{Cmd|startx}}

This will start the X11 server with default options and try to find an X11 session (e.g. a desktop environment) to start.

If you'd like to specify the session (program to start) yourself, you can do so as an argument to startx:

{{Cmd|startx /usr/bin/startxfce4}}

You can also pass X11 server options, by preceding them with a double dash:

{{Cmd|startx -- vt7}}


=== Using a dedicated session runner ===

Some of the desktop environments provide their own replacements for ''startx''. For example, Xfce4 provides ''startxfce4'':

{{Cmd|startxfce4 -- vt7}}


== Starting X11 automatically ==
=== Starting X11 on console login ===

To avoid having to type the ''startx'' command over and over again, you may decide that a login to a specific vt should start X11. One of the ways to achieve that is to put a code like the following into your shell's RC (e.g. ''~/.bashrc''):

{{File|~/.bashrc|X11 autostart with login on vt8|<pre>
if [[ ! ${DISPLAY} && ${XDG_VTNR} == 8 ]]; then
    exec startx
fi
</pre>}}

The ''XDG_VTNR'' variables specifies the VT number. If you'd like to use another VT, adjust the number accordingly.

The additional ''DISPLAY'' check is necessary since the snippet will be executed on each new interactive shell. Since ''XDG_VTNR'' will be set to the same value in the shells started within the X11 session (e.g. terminals), it is necessary to prevent them from trying to start X11.

The ''exec'' command causes the login shell to be replaced by the X11 session. This means that the user won't be able to use the shell used to start X11 anymore, and whenever the X11 session terminates, user will be logged back out. If you'd prefer to remain being logged in into vt, remove the ''exec'' word.

{{Note|The ''DISPLAY'' check is fairly fragile. For example, if you ''unset DISPLAY'' in a terminal and start bash afterwards, it will try to start X11.}}
