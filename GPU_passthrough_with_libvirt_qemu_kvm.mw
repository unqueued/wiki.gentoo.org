'''GPU''' passthrough is a technology that allows you to [[Article description::directly present an internal PCI GPU to a virtual machine]]. 
The device acts as if it were directly driven by the VM, and the VM detects the PCI device as if it were physically connected. GPU passthrough is also often known as IOMMU, although this is a bit of a misnomer, since the IOMMU is the hardware technology that provides this feature but also provides other features such as some protection from DMA attacks or ability to address 64-bit memory spaces with 32-bit addresses. 

As you can imagine, the most common application for GPU passthrough at least gaming, since GPU passthrough allows a VM direct access to your graphics card with the end result of being able to play games with nearly the same performance as if you were running your game directly on your computer. 

'''QEMU''' ('''Q'''uick '''EMU'''lator) is a generic, open source hardware emulator and virtualization suite.


{{Note|This article typically uses KVM as the accelerator of choice due to its GPL licensing and availability. Without KVM nearly all commands described here will still work (unless KVM specific).}}

== Installation ==

=== BIOS and UEFI firmware ===

In order to utilize KVM either Vt-x or AMD-V must be supported by the processor. Vt-x or AMD-V are Intel and AMD's respective technologies for permitting multiple operating systems to concurrently execute operations on the processors.   

To inspect hardware for visualization support issue the following command:

{{Cmd|grep --color -E "vmx{{!}}svm" /proc/cpuinfo}}  

For a period manufacturers were shipping with virtualization turned off by default in the system [[BIOS]]
