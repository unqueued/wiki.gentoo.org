= The problem =

{{c|linux-headers-5.2}} updated {{c|SIOCGSTAMP}} ioctl to work against 32-bit and 64-bit {{c|struct timeval}}. Commit: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0768e17073dc527ccd18ed5f96ce85f9985e9115

This shuffled headers a bit and caused build breakage for linux-specific software:

{{CodeBox|<nowiki>
dhcp.c:182:17: error: SIOCGSTAMP was not declared in this scope
</nowiki>}}

= The fix =

Normally you just need to include the header that now contains {{c|SIOCGSTAMP}} definition:

{{CodeBox|1=
#include <linux/sockios.h>
}}
