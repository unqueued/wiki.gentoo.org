Options:

  -c  display the currently compiling packages (if any)
  -e  display package history; default if any option is used.
  -f  read emerge log information from "logfile" instead of ""
  -h  print this help
  -i  extra infos for the selected package (build specific USE, CFLAGS,
      CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables, average build time, etc)
  -g  display GMT/UTC, not localized time.
  -l  show full merge history.
  -n  no color in output
  -p  estimate build time from a piped "emerge -p" output
  -q  query gentoo.linuxhowtos.org database if no local emerge was found
  -r  search for portage tree sync/rsync history.
  -s  use (case insensitive) regular expressions to match package names
  -S  use case sensitive regular expressions to match package names
  -t  calculate merge time for the specific package(s).
  -u  show when packages have been unmerged.
  -v  display genlop version and exit.

  --date datestring1 [--date datestring2] only shows results between
    datestring1 and datestring2.
    datestring2 defaults to "now" if not explicitly set.
    (e.g. genlop --list --date 3 days ago) shows packages emerged since this
    time three days ago.
