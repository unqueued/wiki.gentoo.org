== Installation ==

There are several methods of using Flash Player on Gentoo. Some will work in all web browsers, while others only work in a select few.

=== Adobe Flash ===

Adobe provides a Flash Player for [[Wikipedia:NPAPI|NPAPI]]-based browsers (e.g. Firefox, Konqueror) on Linux. They have discontinued the development of this NPAPI-based Flash Player for Linux, but have stated they will provide security updates for five years after the release of Flash Player 11.2<ref>Mike Chambers. [http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2012/02/adobe-and-google-partnering-for-flash-player-on-linux.html Adobe and Google Partnering for Flash Player on Linux], [http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer Adobe AIR and Adobe Flash Player Team Blog], February 22nd, 2012. Retrieved on June 10th, 2015.</ref>. Support for this version of the player should be ending around 2017.

{{Note|
Depending on the value of the <var>ACCEPT_LICENSE</var> variable found in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}, it may be necessary to accept a special license agreement before installing Flash. If Portage prompts concerning a license issue run the following command:

: {{RootCmd|echo ">{{=}}www-plugins/adobe-flash-11.2.202.491 AdobeFlash-11.x" >> /etc/portage/package.license}}
}}

To use Flash Player with a NPAPI-based browser, install Adobe Flash:

{{Emerge|www-plugins/adobe-flash}}

After installation, start or restart the web browser.

=== Google Chrome ===

Google [[Chrome]] includes a [[Wikipedia:Google_Native_Client#Pepper|PPAPI]]-based Flash Player which is actively maintained by Adobe. To use Flash Player, install Google Chrome:

{{Emerge|www-client/google-chrome}}

This will not enable Flash Player for use in browsers outside of Google Chrome, but a plug-in can be installed to enable the PPAPI-based Flash Player with NPAPI-based browsers. This is done with freshplayerplugin (see the section below).

=== freshplayerplugin ===

{{Package|www-plugins/freshplayerplugin}} is a NPAPI wrapper for the PPAPI-based Flash Player. To use the PPAPI-based Flash Player with a NPAPI-based browser, install {{Package|www-plugins/chrome-binary-plugins}} with the <code>flash</code> USE flag:

{{Emerge|www-plugins/chrome-binary-plugins}}

Or install Google Chrome:

{{Emerge|www-client/google-chrome}}

Next, install freshplayerplugin:

{{Emerge|www-plugins/freshplayerplugin}}

After installation close and reopen the web browser to verify the plugin has been loaded.

=== Without Flash Player ===

An alternative to using Flash Player when only playing video streams from YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Internet TV stream, etc., is to install {{Package|media-video/mpv}} with the <code>lua</code> USE flag, and {{Package|media-video/ffmpeg}} or {{Package|media-video/libav}} with the <code>openssl</code> USE flag. The <code>lua</code> USE flag allows {{Package|net-misc/youtube-dl}} to work in mpv, and the <code>openssl</code> USE flag allows FFmpeg/Libav to open https:// streams. Next, install the [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-with/ Open-with Firefox add-on] and configure it in the following way:

* Open {{Path|about:openwith}}, select {{Path|Add...}}
* In the dialog select a video streaming capable player (e.g. {{Path|/usr/bin/mpv}}).
* (Optional step) Choose how to display the dialogs using the left panel of Open-with add-on.
* Right click on links or visit pages containing videos. If the site is supported, the player will be open as expected.

The same procedure can be used to associate other video downloaders such as {{c|youtube-dl}}.
