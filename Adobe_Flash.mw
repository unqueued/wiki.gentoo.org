== Introduction ==

This document contains several solutions to using Adobe Flash on Gentoo systems.

== Installation ==

=== www-plugins/adobe-flash ===

The www-plugins/adobe-flash package is the official linux implementation of Adobe Flash. Adobe has dropped support for any versions newer than 11.2 so this package might work for your needs but is likely to be very old, buggy, and contain security vulnerabilities.

=== www-client/google-chrome-beta ===
Google Chrome includes the Pepper-based Flash plug-in which is much more up-to-date. Simply emerge www-client/google-chrome-beta to use flash in Chrome.

=== www-plugins/freshplayerplugin ===

The freshplayerplugin is a PPAPI-host NPAPI-plugin adapter for flashplayer in npapi based browsers. First emerge www-client/google-chrome-beta, open it at least once, then emerge www-plugins/freshplayerplugin and start/restart firefox. A more recent version of flash should now work in firefox.
