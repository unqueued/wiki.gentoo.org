== Installation ==

There are several solutions to using Adobe Flash on Gentoo based systems. Some work in all browsers, while others only work in a select few. Following the Gentoo philosophy, choose the version that works best.

==== www-plugins/adobe-flash ====

The {{Package|www-plugins/adobe-flash}} package is the official Linux implementation of Adobe Flash. Adobe has dropped support for any versions newer than 11.2 so this package may work for certain needs but is likely to be old, buggy, and contain ''many'' security vulnerabilities. Its use is '''not''' recommended.

To use this solution, run the following:

{{Emerge|www-plugins/adobe-flash}}

After emerging start or (restart if it was running) [[Firefox]]. An old, buggy, insecure version of Adobe Flash should now be available for use.

==== www-client/google-chrome-beta ====

Google Chrome includes the Pepper-based Flash plug-in which is much more up-to-date. Simply <tt>emerge</tt> {{Package|www-client/google-chrome-beta}} to use flash in Chrome:

{{Emerge|www-client/google-chrome-beta}}

This will not setup flash for use for browsers outside of Chrome, but a Chrome plugin can be used to enabled Flash on Firefox. This is done with the freshflashplayer plugin (see the section below).

==== www-plugins/freshplayerplugin ====

The freshplayerplugin is a PPAPI-host NPAPI-plugin adapter for flashplayer in APAPI-based browsers. First

{{Emerge|www-client/google-chrome-beta}}

Next, open the Chrome browser at least one time. After Chrome opens install the {{Package|www-plugins/freshplayerplugin}} package:

{{Emerge|www-plugins/freshplayerplugin}}

Then and start (or restart if it was already running) Firefox. A more recent version of Flash should now be available for use in Firefox.
