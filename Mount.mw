Mounting is the attaching of an additional [[filesystem]] to the currently accessible filesystem of a computer.<ref>http://www.linfo.org/mounting.html</ref>

== Installation ==

The <tt>mount</tt> command is part of the {{Package|sys-apps/util-linux}} package. In Gentoo Linux {{Package|sys-apps/util-linux}} is part of the system set and is installed on all Gentoo systems by default. If for some strange and unordinary reason it is missing it can be re-installed by running a simple <tt>emerge</tt> command:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/util-linux}}

== Usage ==

Show mounted filesystems by running the mount command with no arguments or options:

{{RootCmd|mount}}

Mount a filesystem. A [[device file]], [[fstab#UUIDs and labels|UUID or label]] or other means of locating the partition or data source and a mount point are required. Non-system relevant filesystems are normally mounted in the {{Path|/mnt}} directory. The proper syntax for mounting a file system is as follows:

{{RootCmd|mount <DEVICE> <DIRECTORY>}}

For further details see {{c|man 8 mount}}.

The {{Path|/media}} directory is generally used to mount removable devices such as USB drives or SD cards. After determining which device the USB drive shows up as, a command like the following could be used to mount its contents to a newly created {{Path|usb}} folder in {{Path|/media}}

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /media/usb
|mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb
}}

To unmount a filesystem the device file or the mount point can be specified:

{{RootCmd|umount <DEVICE>}}

{{RootCmd|umount <DIRECTORY>}}

Sometimes mounting a filesystem requires special options.

{{RootCmd|mount [OPTIONS] <DEVICE> <DIRECTORY>}}

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|+ Program options
|-
! Option
! Description
|-
| <code>-f</code>
| Simulate the mount
|-
| <code>-t</code>
| Specify the filesystem, e.g [[ext4]]
|-
| <code>-o OPTION1,OPTION2,...</code>
| Specify the mount options (see below)
|-
| <code>-a</code>
| Mount all filesystems in {{Path|/etc/fstab}}
|-
|}

The filesystem being used must support the mount option being passed. Many options are common, but some ''are'' filesystem specific. For more information see the {{c|mount}} [[man page]].

{| class="table table-condensed table-striped"
|+ Mount options
|-
! Option
! Description
|-
| <code>defaults</code>
| Use the default mount options: <code>rw</code>, <code>suid</code>, <code>dev</code>, <code>exec</code>, <code>auto</code>, <code>nouser</code>, <code>async</code>.
|-
| <code>auto</code>
| Mount the filesystem automatically on boot.
|-
| <code>noauto</code>
| Do not mount the filesystem automatically on boot.
|-
| <code>ro</code>
| Mount the filesystem read-only.
|-
| <code>rw</code>
| Mount the filesystem read-write.
|-
| <code>sw</code>
| Mount a swap filesystem.
|-
| <code>atime</code>
| Update inode access times on every read.
|-
| <code>relatime</code>
| Update inode access times only on writes to improve I/O performance.
|-
| <code>noatime</code>
| Never update inode access times for best I/O performance.
|-
| <code>sync</code>
| Sync drive after each write. Can shorten life for e.g. some flash drives.
|-
| <code>async</code>
| Sync drive asynchronously.
|-
| <code>discard</code>
| The equivalent of trim support on Linux.
|-
| <code>exec</code>
| Allow execution of binaries.
|-
| <code>noexec</code>
| Do not allow execution of binaries.
|-
| <code>suid</code>
| Follow SUID and SGID bits.
|-
| <code>nosuid</code>
| Do not follow SUID and SGID bits.
|-
| <code>user</code>
| Allow a user to mount the filesystem.
|-
| <code>users</code>
| Allow every user to mount the filesystem.
|-
| <code>nouser</code>
| Allow only "root" to mount the filesystem.
|-

=== Mounting as non-superuser ===
According to <tt>man mount</tt> only the superuser can mount filesystems. However, when [[fstab]] contains the <tt>user</tt> option on a line any user will be capable of mounting the corresponding partition, device, drive, etc.

=== Mounting removable media ===

See the relevant section in the [[Removable_media#Mounting_removable_media|Removable media]] article.

=== Mounting Windows shares (cifs) ===

Despite [[fstab]] entries non-superuser mounts of Windows shares will fail (for security reasons). In the following example is found a {{Path|fstab}} entry for Windows share; pay close attention to the <code>cifs</code> option:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
[...]
//server/folder /home/larry/winmount cifs noauto,user 0 0
[...]
}}

{{Cmd|mount /home/larry/winmount|output=<pre>
This program is not installed setuid root -  "user" CIFS mounts not supported.
</pre>}}

The solution is to use {{c|sudo mount /home/larry/winmount}} in combination with a corresponding entry in {{Path|/etc/sudoers}} to allow passwordless mounting. Be sure to read [[Sudo#Configuration|this]] before editing the {{Path|/etc/sudoers}} file!

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sudoers|1=
[...]
larry    ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/mount  /home/larry/winmount/, /bin/mount  /home/larry/winmount
larry    ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/umount /home/larry/winmount/, /bin/umount /home/larry/winmount
[...]
}}
