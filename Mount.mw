'''''Mounting''' is the attaching of an additional [[filesystem]] to the currently accessible filesystem of a computer.'' - [http://www.linfo.org/mounting.html Mounting Definition] by <nowiki>www.linfo.org</nowiki>

== Installation ==
'''mount''', part of {{Package|sys-apps/util-linux}}, is part of the system set and so already installed on your system.

== Usage ==
* Show mounted filesystems:
: {{RootCmd|mount}}

* Mount a filesystem. [[device file]] and mountpoint are required. Non system relevant filesystems are normally mounted in {{Path|/mnt}}.
: {{RootCmd|mount DEVICE_FILE MOUNTPOINT}}

* Umount a filesystem. You can specify the device file or the mountpoint:
: {{RootCmd|umount DEVICE_FILE}}
: {{RootCmd|umount MOUNTPOINT}}

* Mount a filesystem with additional options:
: {{RootCmd|mount OPTIONS DEVICE_FILE MOUNTPOINT}}
