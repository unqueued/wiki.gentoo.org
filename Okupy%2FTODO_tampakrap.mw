django-auth-ldap

    Custom LDAPGroupType for gentooACL support ([https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/django-auth-ldap/d0EEkKAVCAo ML thread])
        Probably skipped, it should be probably done with django-ldapdb and LDAPUser instead
    Raise exception when hitting LDAPError ([https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/django-auth-ldap/utS-Yq_LKPc ML thread])
    Raise exception on DatabaseError
