== Perl-related categories and packages ==
The Perl language itself is {{c|dev-lang/perl}}. There're three Perl-related categories:
* {{c|[https://packages.gentoo.org/categories/dev-perl dev-perl]}}: Libraries in/for Perl, corresponding to {{c|dev-java}}, {{c|dev-python}}, etc.
* {{c|[https://packages.gentoo.org/categories/perl-core perl-core]}}: Packages in this category are, depending on their versions, modules included in {{c|dev-lang/perl}}, but also distributed as separete packages. When modules are installed via {{c|perl-core}}, they override the counterpart in the core {{c|dev-lang/perl}}. For the details, see below.
* {{c|[https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/search?q{{=}}virtual%2Fperl virtual/perl-*]}}: Virtual packages that allow choosing a module between {{c|perl-core/}} packages and the one contained in the core {{c|dev-lang/perl}}.

More on perl-core: (Taken from [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608168#c1])
* It allows users to have more update versions of some modules that the core ones.
* It allows package-based installation, without bumping or patching the core perl.
* Sometimes these modules get deprecated in newer Perl. Such cases are handled by virtual/perl-*. Search [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608168#c1] for "Module::Build" for more in-depth stories.

== Upgrading Perl ==
When the official way {{c|$ emerge --oneshot --ask dev-lang/perl}} works, it's fine. See [[#The official way]] below for more. Unfortunately, it often doesn't work, mainly due to unresolved slot conflicts. There's no "official" way to handle it yet.

It may work by updating "world", i.e. {{c|$ emerge --ask -uN --deep @world}}, but it will pull in more than necessary. Specifying the depth to 2 or 3 may make the dependency smaller, like this: {{c|$ emerge -auN --deep 2 @world}}.

Below we give two recommendable ways to cope with that situation.

The support thread in the forum is [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8028098.html found here].

=== The official way ===
{{RootCmd
| emerge --oneshot --ask dev-lang/perl
| emerge --depclean --ask ### Not really necessary, but recommended
| perl-cleaner --all}}

=== Some knowledge ===
* Perl-realted modules are installed under e.g. {{c|/usr/lib/perl/vendor_perl/5.22.3/}}, except those from the core Perl. Notice that the core Perl version number is present. When upgrading Perl, they have to be re-emerged, too.
* During Perl upgrading, packages that depend on Perl may become unavailable.

In order to upgrade to unstable (~arch) version, you may have to unmask *all*, by running:
<pre><nowiki>{
  echo "### perl keywords"
  eix '-#C' dev-perl
  eix '-#C' perl-core
  eix '-#' virtual/perl-
  echo dev-lang/perl
} >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
</nowiki></pre>

=== app-admin/gentoo-perl-helpers ===
This recent package (appeared in Jan 2017) {{package|app-admin/gentoo-perl-helpers}} ([https://github.com/gentoo-perl/gentoo-perl-helpers git repository]) still needs to be tested, but must be far better than {{c|$ emerge -auDN @world}}. It is written by [[User:Kentnl|K. Fredric]] (kentnl), a Gentoo [[Project:Perl|Perl Project]] member.

==== Basic usage ====
Assume you have 5.20.*, and want to upgrade to 5.22.*.
{{RootCmd
| gentoo-perl gen-upgrade-sets 5.20 5.22}}
Now you will have two sets {{c|perl-upgrade}} and {{c|perl-cleanup}}, (stored in {{path|/etc/portage/sets}}). Then simply do
{{RootCmd| emerge --oneshot --ask @perl-upgrade}}
Once this is done, do {{c|$ emerge -ac; perl-cleaner --all}}.

Help can be read by:
{{Cmd | gentoo-perl help gen-upgrade-sets }}

==== Details ====
In {{c|$ gentoo-perl gen-upgrade-sets}}, packages' keyword & mask are irrelevant. Simply the specified versions matter. The examples of the version are {{c|5.20}}, {{c|5.22}}, etc, '''not''' {{c|5.22.3_rc4}} or {{c|5.24.1_rc4}}. More precisely, they should be the sub-slot number, not atoms' versions.

If portage complains about unsatisfied conflicts, you can try deleting blockers before upgrading:
{{RootCmd
| emerge --unmerge @perl-cleanup ### Use --unmerge (-C), not --depclean (-c)
| emerge --oneshot --ask @perl-upgrade}}

In the event that portage fails while upgrading Perl, so that some but not all packages are emerged, then update (= trim down) the set {{c|@perl-upgrade}}:
{{RootCmd
| # The same command as the first time generation.
| gentoo-perl gen-upgrade-sets 5.20 5.22}}
Now you can resume the emerge by
{{RootCmd
| emerge --oneshot --ask @perl-upgrade}}

If you want to store the sets elsewhere, do 
{{Cmd
|# You don't have to be root
| 2= ETC_PORTAGE_SETS="/tmp/sets/" gentoo-perl gen-upgrade-sets 5.20 5.22
| 3= # To use it later, don't forget to do this:
| 4= sudo cp /tmp/sets/* /etc/portage/sets/*}}

=== A wild way ===
Caution: There's no guarantee that it works. This prescription is given here becuse of its extreme simplicity.
{{RootCmd
| emerge --ask --oneshot --nodeps dev-lang/perl # Break the dependency temporarily.
| perl-cleaner --all
| emerge --ask dev-lang/perl ### To reclaim the correct dependency.}}
