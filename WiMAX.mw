The '''WiMAX''' ('''Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access''') system provides users mobile broadband Internet using the 2G and 3G networks. This article explains the setup of WiMAX USB dongles.

== Double mode ==
Most USB WiMAX dongles have a double mode. If you would insert the modem in a Windows system, it will first be recognized as a storage device, and the provider's software and drivers will be installed by means of auto-play. After this software is installed, the software performs a mode-switch of the dongle, to make it available as a modem. After this the dialer will establish a connection for you.

Because this software is not compatible with any form of Linux, we will have to perform the steps ourselves, or better by means of open-source tools available from the tree.

== Supported hardware ==
This workflow is tested on the following hardware:

{{Note|Please update this if you have tested it on other hardware.}}

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Networking support --->
    [*] WiMAX Wireless Broadband support
Device drivers --->
    [*] Network device support
        WiMMAX broadband devices --->
            <*> Intel Wireless WiMAX Connection 2400 over USB
        USB Network adapters --->
            <*> Option USB High Speed Mobile Devices
        <*> PPP (point-to-point protocol) support
            [*] PPP multilink support
            <*> PPP support for async serial ports
            <*> PPP support for sync tty ports 
            <*> PPP Deflate compression
            <*> PPP BSD-Compress compression  
            <*> PPP MPPE compression (encryption) (EXPERIMENTAL)
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
[[usb_modeswitch]] is a mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" (multiple device) USB gear. Most mobile broadband modems act as a storage device when connected. This is to install their drivers under MS Windows. We do not need the driver, nor do we need the modem to be in storage mode. So we use this tool to switch to modem mode. Install {{Package|sys-apps/usb_modeswitch}}
{{Emerge|usb_modeswitch}}

'''usb_modeswitch''' comes with its own [[udev]] rules. If your device is supported, it should be mode-switched when inserted. You can check {{Path|/var/log/messages}} to see if it switched indeed.
