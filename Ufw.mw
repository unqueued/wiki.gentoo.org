'''Ufw''' stands for uncomplicated firewall, and is just that.  It uses logs such as those obtained by [[syslog-ng]] for monitoring, and uses [[iptables]] as a back end.  Ufw supports both ip v4 & ip v6.

== Instillation ==
=== kernel ===
the following kernel configurations must be made before ufw will work.
{{kernel|ip v4 settings|<pre>
[*] Networking support  --->
        Networking options  --->
            [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)  --->
                Core Netfilter Configuration  --->
                    <M>   "addrtype" address type match support
                    <M>   "comment" match support
                    <M>   "hl" hoplimit/TTL match support
                    <M>   "limit" match support
                    <M>   "multiport" Multiple port match support
                    <M>   "recent" match support
                    <M>   NetBIOS name service protocol support
</pre>}}

ip v6 is not required, however it is highly recommended.

{{kernel|ip v6 settings|<pre>
[*] Networking support  --->
        Networking options  --->
            [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)  --->
                IPv6: Netfilter Configuration  --->
                    <M>   "rt" Routing header match support
                    <M>   "HL" hoplimit target support
</pre>}}
