'''Ufw''' stands for uncomplicated firewall, and is just that.  It uses logs such as those obtained by [[syslog-ng]] for monitoring, and uses [[iptables]] as a back end.  Ufw supports both ip v4 & ip v6.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

The following kernel configuration must be made before ufw will work.

{{Note|You must make configurations for [[iptables]] & run the [[iptables]] wiki page on top of these}}

{{KernelBox|title=ip v4 settings|
[*] Networking support  --->
        Networking options  --->
            [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)  --->
                Core Netfilter Configuration  --->
                    <M>   NetBIOS name service protocol support
}}

IP version 6 is not required, however it is highly recommended.

{{KernelBox|title=ip v6 settings|
[*] Networking support  --->
        Networking options  --->
            [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)  --->
