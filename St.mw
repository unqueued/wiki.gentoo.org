st is [[Article description::a simple terminal implementation for X environment made by [https://st.suckless.org/ suckless.org community].]]

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-terms/st}}

Preferably, <code>savedconfig</code> USE flag can be enabled and save a customized configuration file to {{Path|/etc/portage/savedconfig/x11-terms/st}} for later editing pleasure.

{{RootCmd|euse --enable savedconfig}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|x11-terms/st}}:

{{emerge|x11-terms/st}}

== Configuration ==

As stated previously, the main st configuration file is the {{Path|/etc/portage/savedconfig/x11-terms/st}} file and after each change, st needs to be recompiled for any changes to take effect.

== Patches and additional features ==

{{warning| Someone who has minimum experience in x11-terms/st (KREYREN) wrote this. Someone should verify the informations. Use on your own risk.}}

=== Introduction ===
if ebuild supports <b>saveconfig</b> USE flag and if it's enabled then it's possible to make a custom patch for any ebuild.

<b>saveconfig</b> USE flag is enabled by default in x11-terms/st -> using this USE flag on x11-term/st is unemergefull. 

Appling patches is part of emerging. Patches will be applied after the emerging is done. User will be informed with output <code>* User patches applied.</code> followed by more info about the patch installation.

=== Making a patch ===
{{warning|This section is `Work In Progress`. Use on your own risk}}

Syntax for patch name is <b><name>.patch</b> where <code>.patch</code> is important.

It's recommended to use <b>XX-<name>.patch</b> where XX is number. Note that patch 01 will be emerged before patch 02 and so on. It's also easier to organize patches this way.

==== Path for patches ====
 <code>/etc/portage/patches/<package_category>/<package_name-version>/XX-<patch_name>.patch</code>

==== Syntax for patches ====
I understand that patches are written as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff diff].
<code>
/* i have no idea what does this means, contribute if you do know the syntax. */
diff --git a/config.def.h b/config.def.h

---<dependant_file>
+++<new_dependat_file>

-<string_from_original_source>
+<new_string>
</code>

=== Sources for community patches ===

There are many user-created [http://st.suckless.org/patches/ patches] available from the offical site that greatly extend the functionality of st.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Keyboard ===

==== Delete key is not working properly ====

Add following to the {{Path|/etc/inputrc}} to make a system-wide change:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/inputrc|lang=text|1=
set enable-keypad on
}}

Or to the relative user's {{Path|~/.inputrc}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.inputrc|lang=text|1=
$include /etc/inputrc
set enable-keypad on
}}
