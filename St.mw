=== USE flags ===
{{USEflag|package=x11-terms/st}}

Preferably, you'll want to enable <code>savedconfig</code> USE flag and save your customized configuration file to {{Path|/etc/portage/savedconfig/x11-terms/st}} for later editing pleasure.

{{RootCmd|euse --enable savedconfig}}

=== Emerge ===
Install {{Package|x11-terms/st}}:

== Configuration ==
As stated previously, the main st configuration file is the {{Path|/etc/portage/savedconfig/x11-terms/st}} file and after each change, st needs to be recompiled for any changes to take effect.

===Patches & additional features===
There are many user-created [http://st.suckless.org/patches/ patches] available from the offical site that greatly extend the functionality of st.

== Troubleshooting ==
