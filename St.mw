== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-terms/st}}

Preferably, <code>savedconfig</code> USE flag can be enabled and save a customized configuration file to {{Path|/etc/portage/savedconfig/x11-terms/st}} for later editing pleasure.

{{RootCmd|euse --enable savedconfig}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|x11-terms/st}}:

{{emerge|x11-terms/st}}

== Configuration ==

As stated previously, the main st configuration file is the {{Path|/etc/portage/savedconfig/x11-terms/st}} file and after each change, st needs to be recompiled for any changes to take effect.

=== Patches and additional features ===

There are many user-created [http://st.suckless.org/patches/ patches] available from the offical site that greatly extend the functionality of st.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Keyboard ===

==== Delete key is not working properly ====

Add following to the {{Path|/etc/inputrc}} to make a system-wide change:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/inputrc|lang=text|1=
set enable-keypad on
}}

Or to the relative user's {{Path|~/.inputrc}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.inputrc|lang=text|1=
$include /etc/inputrc
set enable-keypad on
}}
