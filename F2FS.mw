F2FS is available in Linux kernels 3.8.x and higher. Its specialty is NAND flash devices. This filesystem is a good choice when installing Gentoo on an SD card or a flash-based USB device.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

When enabling support to the filesystem in the Linux kernel, it is wise to enable at least the first four options in order to support extended filesystem attributes:

* <var>CONFIG_F2FS_FS</var>
* <var>F2FS_FS_XATTR</var>
* <var>CONFIG_F2FS_FS_POSIX_ACL</var>
* <var>CONFIG_F2FS_FS_SECURITY</var>

The fifth option in the list will enable F2FS's filesystem consistency checking. The checking will occur during run time and will decrease the filesystem's performance. This option provides an advantage when consistency is more important than speed.

The sixth, and final option, is encryption. If encryption is in the use case, then this option should be enabled as well. It does not hurt to enable this option even if encryption will not be used right away.

=== Emerge ===

Install the user space tools for the f2fs filesystem:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/f2fs-tools}}

== Usage ==

=== Creation ===

After emerging the userspace tools, create a filesystem by running the {{c|mkfs.f2fs}} command followed by the appropriate device and partition number:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.f2fs /dev/sdd1}}

=== Filesystem check ===

{{RootCmd|fsck.f2fs /dev/sdd1}}

=== Defragmentation ===

{{RootCmd|defrag.f2fs}}
