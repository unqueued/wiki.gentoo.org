A '''device file''' is an interface for a device driver that appears in a [[filesystem]] as if it were an ordinary file. They allow software to interact with a device driver. The files are in the {{Path|/dev}} directory.

== Installation ==
To manage device files, by default, [[udev]] is used, which will take care of any installation of said files.

Alternatives to udev:

* [[eudev]]
* [[mdev]]
* [[static-dev]]
* [[vdev]]

== Usage ==

=== Creation ===
For each device (internal or peripheral devices) there is a device file. During kernel boot time the kernel detects the devices and creates a device file in the virtual ''devtmpfs'' filesystem. Afterwards [[udev]] takes over the device files and restores them in {{Path|/dev}}. From this point on udev is in charge to create new and to delete unavailable device files.

=== Permissions ===
Like other files access to device file is restricted by filesystem permissions. The permission to access a device file have to be granted first to an user:
* Add the user to the group the device file belongs to.
* Setup [[ConsoleKit]] to grant access to some device files (e.g. sound device files) to the user of the active, local session.

=== Symlinks ===
udev creates for some device classes additional symlinks. The device file {{Path|/dev/cdrom}} (first CDROM drive) and {{Path|/dev/dvd}} (first DVD drive) are just symlinks to the device file {{Path|/dev/sr0}} (first optical drive). You can use the symlinks in programs and config files like every other device file. Other examples are {{Path|/dev/input}} for [[:Category:Input devices|input devices]] or {{Path|/dev/disk}} for [[:Category:Storage devices|storage devices]].
