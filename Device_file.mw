A '''device file''' is an interface for a device driver that appears in a [[filesystem]] as if it were an ordinary file. They allow software to interact with a device driver. The files are in the {{Path|[[#The_.2Fdev_directory|/dev directory]]}}.

== The /dev directory ==

{{:/dev}}

== Installation ==
To manage device files, by default, [[eudev]] is used, which will take care of any installation of said files.

Alternatives to eudev:

* [[udev]]
* [[mdev]]
* [[static-dev]]
* [[vdev]]

== Usage ==

=== Creation ===
For each device (internal or peripheral devices) there is a device file. During kernel boot time the kernel detects the devices and creates a device file in the virtual ''devtmpfs'' filesystem. Afterwards eudev takes over the device files and restores them in {{Path|/dev}}. From this point on eudev is in charge to create new and to delete unavailable device files.

Information can be obtained [[Eudev#Using_udevadm|using udevadm]]:

Get device info using {{c|udevadm info }} followed by the device path

{{Cmd|udevadm info -p /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7}}

=== Permissions ===
Like other files access to device file is restricted by filesystem permissions. The permission to access a device file have to be granted first to an user:
* Add the user to the group the device file belongs to.
* Setup [[ConsoleKit]] to grant access to some device files (e.g. sound device files) to the user of the active, local session.

=== Symlinks ===
eudev creates for some device classes additional symlinks. The device file {{Path|/dev/cdrom}} (first CDROM drive) and {{Path|/dev/dvd}} (first DVD drive) are just symlinks to the device file {{Path|/dev/sr0}} (first optical drive). You can use the symlinks in programs and config files like every other device file. Other examples are {{Path|/dev/input}} for [[:Category:Input devices|input devices]] or {{Path|/dev/disk}} for [[:Category:Storage devices|storage devices]].
