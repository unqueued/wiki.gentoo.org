A '''device file''' is an interface for a device driver that appears in a [[filesystem]] as if it were an ordinary file. Such files allow software to interact with a device driver. They are found in the [[#The_.2Fdev_directory|{{Path|/dev}} directory]].

== The /dev directory ==

{{:/dev/en}}

== Installation ==
Device files in Gentoo are managed by {{c|[[eudev]]}}, which will take care of installation of any required files.

Alternatives to {{c|eudev}} include:

* {{c|[[udev]]}}
* {{c|[[mdev]]}}
* {{c|[[static-dev]]}}
* {{c|[[vdev]]}}

== Usage ==

=== Creation ===
Each device (either internal or peripheral) has a corresponding device file. During kernel boot time the kernel detects devices and creates device files in the virtual ''[[Udev#Kernel|devtmpfs]]'' filesystem. Then {{c|eudev}} takes over the device files and stores them in {{Path|/dev}}. From this point on, {{c|eudev}} is in charge of creating new device files and deleting unavailable ones.

Information can be obtained by [[Eudev#Using_udevadm|using {{c|udevadm}}]]:

Get device info using {{c|udevadm info}} followed by the device path.

{{Cmd|udevadm info -p /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7}}

=== Permissions ===
Like other files, access to device file is restricted by filesystem permissions. The permission to access a device file have to be granted first to a user:
* Add the user to the group the device file belongs to.
* Setup [[ConsoleKit]] to grant access to some device files (e.g. sound device files) to the user of the active, local session.

=== Symlinks ===
{{c|eudev}} creates for some device classes additional symlinks. The device file {{Path|/dev/cdrom}} (first CDROM drive) and {{Path|/dev/dvd}} (first DVD drive) are just symlinks to the device file {{Path|/dev/sr0}} (first optical drive). You can use the symlinks in programs and config files like every other device file. Other examples are {{Path|/dev/input}} for [[:Category:Input devices|input devices]] or {{Path|/dev/disk}} for [[:Category:Storage devices|storage devices]].
