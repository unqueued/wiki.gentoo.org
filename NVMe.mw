NVM Express (NVMe) devices are [[Article description::flash memory chips connected to a system via the PCI-E bus.]] They are among the fastest memory chips available on the market, faster than solid state drives connected over the SATA bus.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

'''NVM Express block device''' (<var>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NVME</var>) must be activated to gain NVMe device support:

{{KernelBox|title=Linux 4.4.x|1=
Device Drivers  --->
  <*> NVM Express block device      
}}

Devices will show up under {{Path|/dev/nvme*}}.

== Configuration ==

Partition tables and formatting can be performed the same as any other block device.

=== Identifying the device ===

There are minor differences in the naming scheme for devices and partitions when compared to SATA devices. NVMe partitions generally show a 'p' before the partition number. NVMe devices also include namespace support, using a 'n' before listing the namespace. Therefore the first device in the first namespace with one partition will be at the following location: {{Path|/dev/nvme0n1p1}}. The device name is nvme0, in namespace 1, and partition 1.

== Usage ==

=== I/O testing ===

The following command will test the raw read/write speed of a NVMe device. Passing the <code>-t</code> option instructs {{c|hdparm}} to perform  timings  of device reads, <code>-T</code> performs  timings  of  cache reads, and <code>--direct</code> bypasses the page cache and causes reads to go directly from the drive into {{c|hdparm}}'s buffers in raw mode:

{{RootCmd|hdparm -tT --direct /dev/nvme0n1}}
