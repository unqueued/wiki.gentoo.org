[http://razor-qt.org/ Razor-qt] is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt technologies. It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed, and an intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop environments, Razor-qt also works fine with weak machines.

== Installation ==

You can install it using the following command:
{{emerge|x11-wm/razorqt}}

Razor-qt works with various window managers, and if you have none of the supported window managers installed, then the ebuild will default to [[Openbox]], as that is what most of its developers use.

{{USEflag
|doc
|policykit+no+yes
}}

Note that the policykit USE flag is set by default in the desktop profile, which is recommended to be used with a desktop environment like Razor-qt.

The post install message for this package will inform you that you will also likely want to install the following helper applications:

{{emerge|sys-fs/udisks|sys-power/upower}}

== Configuration ==

Most of the configuration of Razor-qt can be done through the Razor Configuration Center, which you can select from the menu. Some options do not have a graphical configuration dialog yet, notably the theme setting. This can be set by editing the file ~/.razor/razor.conf, for example:
{{File|~/.razor/razor.conf|Razor-qt theme configuration|
[General]
theme=a-mego
icon_theme=oxygen
}}

Themes are installed in /usr/share/razor/themes.

Also note that you can configure generic Qt settings in qtconfig.

== Applications ==

Most applications should work well with Razor-qt, but in case you want to keep in the spirit of a light-weight Qt-only desktop, please have a look at the recommendations on the [[QtDesktop]] page.

== Support ==

Support for Razor-qt on Gentoo can be found in the #gentoo-qt IRC channel and the [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-913958-highlight-.html Gentoo Forums Razor-qt topic]. Bugs should be filed at Gentoo's bugzilla.
