'''Razor-qt''' was an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on [[Qt]] technologies. Razor-qt has been merged with the Qt port of LXDE, called "LXQt". A first version (0.7.0) was released in May 2014, which was based on Qt4. A newer version (0.8.0) was released in October 2014, and based on Qt5, which is currently still masked.

Because of compilation bugs with the last available version of Razor-qt, it is masked for removal in December 2014. Users who want a light-weight Qt based desktop environment are recommended to upgrade to [[LXQt]].
