ReText is a Linux ready, simple (yet powerful) text editor for Markdown and reStructured text. ReText includes a built in "Live preview" function so that writers can see their changes in real-time.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-editors/retext}}

=== Emerge ===

Emerge ReText just like any standard program:

{{Emerge|app-editors/retext}}

== Troubleshooting ==

If you start ReText and upon startup get messages such as these:

{{CodeBox|title=ReText message output|1=
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/bin/retext", line 1530, in <module>
  main(sys.argv[1:])
File "/usr/bin/retext", line 1517, in main
  window = ReTextWindow()
File "/usr/bin/retext", line 547, in __init__
  self.tabWidget.addTab(self.createTab(""), self.tr('New document'))
File "/usr/bin/retext", line 605, in createTab
  if self.useWebKit:
AttributeError: 'ReTextWindow' object has no attribute 'useWebKit'
}}

then you will need to build {{Package|dev-python/PyQt4}} with the <code>webkit</code> USE flag enabled. The way of resolving this issue is to modify the {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} file by adding <code>dev-python/PyQt4 webkit</code>:

{{RootCmd|echo "dev-python/PyQt4 webkit" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

For more information on USE flags see the Handbook's [[Handbook:AMD64/Working/USE|USE flag documentation]].

{{Important|If you switch on <code>webkit</code> USE flag for {{Package|dev-python/PyQt4}}, it requires the package {{Package|libxml2}} with the <code>icu</code> USE flag enabled. This will most likely lead to unsolvable Portage conflicts. If you find yourself in this situation try adding <code>icu</code> as a global USE flag in the {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} and re-emerging world. This is a pain but it will fix the problem.}}

Modify:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="... icu ..."
}}

Finally rebuild the system's world packages. This should satisfy all related issues:

{{RootCmd|emerge -uN @world}}

If done correctly any packages that support <code>icu</code> will be rebuilt, including webkit. The above command will probably take quite a while, but having a Markdown editor is worth it, right?!

=== No icons in toolbar ===

If the icons are missing the icon theme needs to be specified in gconf or in the ReText configuration file.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/ReText project/ReText.conf|1=
[General]
iconTheme=gnome
}}
Available icon themes are located in {{Path|/usr/share/icons/}} (hicolor will not work).
