|Dynamic documentation type generation|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
The official gentoo documentation is currently offered through a self-maintained XML format, called GuideXML. Although XML is considered a powerful language for generating other types, we are currently limiting ourselves to HTML output only. We have frequent requests for PDF and, more recently, ePub.

The purpose would be to update our infrastructure to generate multiple output formats, including ePub, for our users.
