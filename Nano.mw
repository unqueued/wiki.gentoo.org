GNU's '''nano''' is an easy to use [[text editor]] with additional functionality. nano is Gentoo's default editor and is part of each installation. It can be replaced without problems by any other text [[:Category:Editor|editor]].

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-editors/nano}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|app-editors/nano}}

== Usage ==

=== First steps ===

Start nano by typing {{c|nano}} in a terminal followed by options or a file. Passing a file name is the most common use:

{{Cmd|nano filename}}

Nano now shows the content of the text file and which can be modified as desired. Navigate through the text with the arrow keys.

At the bottom nano shows shortcuts for common actions, e.g. save or exit. The shortcut to save is shown as <code>^O</code>. Prefix the shortcut with the {{Key|Ctrl}} key. So to save a document (after editing it) press {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|O}}. To exit press {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|X}}.

{{Important|To edit ''configuration files'' always pass {{c|nano}} the <code>-w</code> option. Without the <code>-w</code> option long lines become wrapped lines. This creates problems when saving because the lines are saved as wrapped lines instead of how they were in the original file. Many time this will break configuration files.}}

To see an overview over all options run {{c|nano --help}}

=== Cut, copy, and paste ===

Lines can be cut with the shortcut {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|K}} (copied with {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|^}}) and paste with {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|U}}. To cut or copy multiple lines press the shortcut multiple times.

=== Search ===

Search the text with {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|W}}. Continue the search with {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|W}}.

== Configuration ==

Set options permanently in the {{Path|/etc/nanorc}} configuration file. This configuration applies system wide to all users. To change options only for one user, set the option in the user's {{Path|~/.nanorc}} file. As a general rule, files present in a user's home directory override system wide settings.
