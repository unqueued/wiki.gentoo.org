== Usage ==

=== First steps ===
Start nano by typing in your terminal '''nano''' followed by options. The most common option is a file name and path, e.g.:
{{Cmd|nano filename}}
Nano now shows the content of the text file und you can edit the file. Navigate through the text with the arrow keys.

At the bottom nano shows shortcuts for common actions, e.g. save or exit. The shortcut to save is shown as "^O". You have to prefix the shortcut with the {{Key|Ctrl}} key, so to save press {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|O}}. To exit press {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|X}}.

{{Important|To edit configuration files always use the ''-w'' option. Without that option long lines are wrapped and, when saving, are saved wrapped. This breaks your config files.}}

To see an overview over all options run '''nano --help'''.

=== Cut, Copy and Paste ===
You can cut a line with the shortcut {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|K}} (copy with {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|^}}) and paste it with {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|U}}. To cut / copy multiple line also press the shortcut multiple times.

=== Search ===
Search the text with {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|W}}. Continue the search with {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|W}}.
