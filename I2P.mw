The Invisible Internet Project (I2P).

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===

Java 7 or higher must be installed. See the [[Java]] article for more instructions on how to get the system to that point.

The {{Package|net-vpn/i2p}} is currently marked as unstable. Special permission must be granted for it to install on stable {{Keyword|amd64}} systems:

{{RootCmd|echo "net-vpn/i2p" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords}}

Or:

{{RootCmd|echo "net-vpn/i2p ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|net-vpn/i2p}}

== Setup ==

=== Services ===

==== OpenRC ====

To start the i2p service when the system boots:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add i2p default}}

To start the i2p service now:

{{RootCmd|service i2p start}}

==== systemd ====

To start the i2p service when the system boots:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable i2p.service}}

To start the i2p service now:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start i2p.service}}

=== Configuration ===
Most I2P configuration is done in the Router Console, accessible via web browser at <code>localhost:7657</code> once the router service has been started.

==== Firewall ====
I2P selects a random port between 9000 and 31000 for inbound traffic when the router is first run.  This port is forwarded automatically by UPnP, but if your gateway/firewall does not support UPnP, it will need to be manually forwarded (both TCP and UDP) for best performance.  Visit http://localhost:7657/confignet to find out which port.

== Usage ==

=== Eepsites ===
To access websites hosted on the I2P network, a web browser must be configured to use a proxy at <code>localhost:4444</code> for HTTP and <code>localhost:4445</code> for HTTPS.  This can be accomplished globally in most browsers' proxy settings, or specifically for sites with the .i2p TLD using a plugin like FoxyProxy for [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard Firefox] or [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/foxyproxy-standard/gcknhkkoolaabfmlnjonogaaifnjlfnp Chrome]

=== Bittorrent ===
I2PSnark, the I2P Bittorrent client, is accessible at <code>localhost:7657/i2psnark</code> with no additional configuration.  However, the above Eepsite configuration is necessary to reach the trackers on which the torrents are found.

=== IRC ===
Using any IRC client, set up a connection to <code>localhost:6668</code>
No account creation is required.  If using Pidgin, be sure to fill in the '''Ident name''' and '''Real name''' fields in addition to '''Username''', otherwise Pidgin may expose identity information from other configured accounts.
