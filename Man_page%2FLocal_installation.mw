Assuming the man pages are installed in {{Path|~/.local/share/man}}:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.bash_profile|title=Adding the full local path to <var>MANPATH</var> environment variable.|1=MANPATH="${HOME}/.local/share/man:${MANPATH}"}}
{{FileBox|filename=~/.manpath|title=Instructing {{c|mandb}} where to look.|1=MANDATORY_PATH /home/user/.local/share/man}}
* Updating the database :
{{Cmd|mandb --create --user-db}}
=== Hacks ===
New man page sections like <code>cxx</code> can be created but the man pages themselves have to at least be properly postfixed with <code>.cxx</code>

The default sections must also be included.
{{Cmd|
grep ^SECTION /etc/man_db.conf >> ~/.manpath # The default sections must also be included. |
echo SECTION cxx >> ~/.manpath}}
