''KDE'' is a powerful graphical desktop environment for Unix workstations.

== Installation ==
Before you start, check your USE flags. If you want KDE as your main desktop environment, set the ''desktop/kde'' profile. Else, and if you have no other desktop profile set, enable the ''kde'', ''qt4'', ''qt3support'', ''consolekit'', ''policykit'', ''dbus'' and ''udev'' USE flags.

In Gentoo there are 3 packages that will install a KDE environment:
* {{Package|kde-base/kde-meta}}, the full KDE suite
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}, a bare KDE environment
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-startkde}}, a very minimal KDE environment (no KDE applications or artwork)
Its usually a good idea to start with {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}} and emerge whatever else you need as you go.

KDE pulls in some packages that are quite heavy, {{Package|dev-libs/boost}}, {{Package|x11-libs/qt-gui}}, {{Package|x11-libs/qt-webkit}}, to name but a few, so the emerge will probably take awhile:
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}

=== Meta packages ===
There are other meta packages that can be installed to pull in parts of the KDE suite:
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeaccessibility-meta}}
:Accessibility applications and utilities.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeadmin-meta}}
:Administrative utilities, pulls in tools such as {{Package|kde-base/kuser}}, {{Package|kde-base/kcron}}, etc. which helps you manage your system.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeartwork-meta}}
:Extra themes, screensavers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebindings-meta}}
:Bindings for various languages.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeedu-meta}}
:Educational applications and "games".
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegames-meta}}
:Standard array of desktop games.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegraphics-meta}}
:Graphics applications such as image viewers, color pickers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdemultimedia-meta}}
:Audio and video playback applications and services.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdenetwork-meta}}
:Network applications such as {{Package|kde-base/kopete}} and VNC services.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-meta}}
:The KDE PIM suite.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdesdk-meta}}
:Various development tools.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdetoys-meta}}
:Toy like applications, think {{Package|x11-apps/xeyes}} and alike.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeutils-meta}}
:Stanadard desktop utilies such as a archiver({{Package|kde-base/ark}}), a caluculator({{Package|kde-base/kcalc}}) and more.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdewebdev-meta}}
:Web development tools.

=== Localization ===
For localization of KDE install {{Package|kde-base/kde-l10n}}. If you want only selected languages, define beforehand the ''LINGUAS'' USE flag:
{{File|/etc/make.conf||<pre>
LINGUAS="de"
</pre>}}
{{Emerge|kde-l10n}}

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===
Set KDM as your display manager:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
</pre>}}

You can now start KDE:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}
To start KDE at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm}}

== Addon Software ==

=== KDE Look for GTK+ programs ===
Install {{Package|x11-themes/oxygen-gtk}} and {{Package|kde-misc/kde-gtk-config}}:
{{Emerge|x11-themes/oxygen-gtk|kde-misc/kde-gtk-config}}
Now you can select the GTK+ theme under '''System Settings > Application Appearance > GTK Configuration'''.

=== Widgets ===
Many useful widget are in the {{Package|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}} package:
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}}

=== More KDE software ===
The most important KDE programs are in the portage tree and are mostly located in the [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-base kde-base] and [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-misc kde-misc] categories.
