<!--T:2-->
'''KDE''' is a free software community, producing a wide range of applications including the popular Plasma desktop environment.

<!--T:67-->
Gentoo support for KDE is excellent, with comprehensive packaging of the legacy Plasma 4, next generation KDE Frameworks 5, Plasma 5, and Applications 5, as well as a wide array of other miscellaneous KDE-based software. 

== Prerequisites == <!--T:9-->

=== Profile === <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
Choosing an appropriate [[Profile (Portage)|profile]], although not required, is recommended as it sets a number of global and package-specific USE flags to ease installation and ensure a smooth KDE experience.

<!--T:66-->
In order to choose the most suitable profile, first list what's available:

<!--T:12-->
{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|output=<pre>
  [1]   default/linux/amd64/13.0
  [2]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
  [3]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop
  [4]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
  [5]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd
  [6]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde
  [7]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde/systemd
  [8]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/plasma
  [9]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/plasma/systemd
  ...
</pre>}}

<!--T:13-->
Then, select the right profile, substituting <code>X</code> with the appropriate profile number:

<!--T:14-->
{{RootCmd|eselect profile set X}}

<!--T:16-->
For Plasma 5 desktop environment choose <code>desktop/plasma</code> with [[OpenRC]] or <code>desktop/plasma/systemd</code> with [[systemd]]. For legacy Plasma 4 desktop environment it is recommended to use the <code>desktop/kde</code> profile, which is tailored for use with OpenRC. If systemd is used, choose <code>desktop/kde/systemd</code> instead. 

=== Services === <!--T:17-->

<!--T:18-->
Before installing KDE related software it is recommended that several other services are set up first. Part of that is done automatically if a ''desktop/plasma'' or ''desktop'' [[Profile (Portage)|profile]] is used. These services are: 
* [[D-Bus]]: Enables use of the D-Bus message bus system.
* [[polkit]]: Enables the polkit framework for controlling privileges for system-wide services.
* [[udev]]: Enables support for udev Linux dynamic and persistent device naming.
* [[udisks]]: Enables support for some storage related services.

<!--T:19-->
Follow the links for information how to set up these services. Note that other USE flag combinations than set in this profile may technically be possible (especially if selected applications are run instead of a full KDE Plasma desktop environment), but may be unsupported, untested, or lead to unexpected loss of functionality.

=== X server === <!--T:20-->

<!--T:21-->
Read and follow the instructions in the [[X server]] article to setup the X environment.

== Frameworks == <!--T:69-->

<!--T:70-->
KDE Frameworks 5 is a collection of libraries and software frameworks that provide the foundation for KDE Plasma 5 and KDE Applications 5, but may be leveraged by any Qt application.

<!--T:71-->
As Frameworks are mostly libraries and provide little user functionality, it's not necessary to install them manually - the required packages will be pulled in automatically as dependencies.

=== Available versions === <!--T:100-->

== Plasma == <!--T:72-->

<!--T:73-->
Plasma 5 is the next generation of KDE's desktop environment, based on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5. Upgrading is fairly simple, although it cannot be coinstalled with Plasma 4 due to upstream design decisions.

<!--T:74-->
Note that while Plasma 5 is in a good state, it is still under heavy upstream development and is missing some features present in KDE 4.

=== Available versions === <!--T:101-->

<!--T:80-->
{{Note|Before proceeding, make sure to choose a plasma profile. KDE 4 users will need to take extra steps.}}

=== Upgrade from Plasma 4 === <!--T:81-->

<!--T:75-->
Information on how to upgrade from Plasma 4, migration and troubleshooting can be found on the [[KDE/Plasma_5_upgrade|upgrade page]].

=== Installation === <!--T:82-->

<!--T:83-->
The {{Package|kde-plasma/plasma-meta}} package provides the full Plasma 5 suite, configured by the following USE flags:
{{USEflag|package=kde-plasma/plasma-meta|desc=}}

<!--T:84-->
{{Emerge|kde-plasma/plasma-meta}}

<!--T:85-->
Alternatively, {{Package|kde-plasma/plasma-desktop}} provides the basic desktop, leaving users free to install only the extra packages they require:

<!--T:86-->
{{Emerge|kde-plasma/plasma-desktop}}

<!--T:87-->
{{Note|Please note that such installations will be missing important packages such as {{Package|kde-plasma/powerdevil}} (power management, suspend and hibernate options) and {{Package|kde-plasma/systemsettings}} if this alternative installation is used.}}

=== Widgets === <!--T:52-->

<!--T:76-->
Many useful widgets are in the {{Package|kde-plasma/kdeplasma-addons}} package:

<!--T:77-->
{{Emerge|kde-plasma/kdeplasma-addons}}

=== Display manager === <!--T:88-->

<!--T:89-->
[[SDDM]] (Simple Desktop Display Manager) is the recommended login manager and is pulled in automatically via {{package|kde-plasma/plasma-meta}} by default. This is the preferred option. Alternatively, [[LightDM]] can be used and pulled in by setting USE flag <code>-sddm</code> for {{package|kde-plasma/plasma-meta}}. Change the setting accordingly in {{Path| /etc/conf.d/xdm}}. Also, be sure to read through the [[SDDM]] page if further issues appear.

== Applications == <!--T:90-->

<!--T:91-->
Releases consist of various applications and supporting libraries based on Qt 5/KDE Frameworks 5 as well as Qt 4/KDElibs 4, with the latter still being in long term support mode. In Portage, the distinction is made using slots <code>4</code> and <code>5</code>. Porting is an ongoing process where each major release is making inroads to Frameworks 5, and therefore contains both well matured and newly ported applications. Note that it also means potential dependency conflicts even within one major release, when two packages depend on slot 4 and 5 of the same library that can not be installed at the same time. The meta packages are taking these conflicts into account and will in some cases prefer the more reliable version over a new port.

=== Localization === <!--T:30-->

<!--T:31-->
To [[localization|localize]] KDE Applications, enable the <code>nls</code> USE flag to automatically pull in the necessary packages, either globally in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} or just for the relevant meta packages:

<!--T:108-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/kde-apps-nls|title=Setting the <var>nls</var> USE flag per package|lang=bash|1=
kde-apps/kde-apps-meta nls
kde-apps/kdepim-meta nls
kde-apps/plasma-telepathy-meta nls
}}

<!--T:60-->
If only a select few languages are desired, define the <var>L10N</var> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. E.g. to use the German language, set:

<!--T:32-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Setting the <var>L10N</var> variable for the German language|lang=bash|1=
L10N="de"
}}

<!--T:109-->
{{Note|To put these [[USE_flag]] changes into effect, a rebuild of the above list of packages is required.}}

<!--T:110-->
To '''manually''' install these localization packages, use the following (complete) list or pick as desired:

<!--T:33-->
{{Emerge|kde-l10n kde4-l10n kdepim-l10n ktp-l10n}}

<!--T:35-->
{{Package|app-office/calligra}} has its own localization package too: {{package|app-office/calligra-l10n}}.

<translate>

<!--T:99-->
In Portage, two variants of KDE PIM, the KDE personal information management suite (including {{Package|kde-apps/kmail}}, {{Package|kde-apps/kontact}}, and {{Package|kde-apps/korganizer}}) are currently available, still based on Qt 4/KDElibs 4. The current, up-to-date version including an Akonadi-based kmail (also known as kmail2) is installed by default. By locally placing a [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/kde.git/plain/Documentation/package.mask/kdepim-4.7 mask file] into {{Path|/etc/portage/package.mask}}, the "[https://launchpad.net/~pali/+archive/ubuntu/kdepim-noakonadi noakonadi fork]" is used including a non-Akonadi kmail (also known as kmail1).

<!--T:112-->
In addition, the KDE overlay provides the latest upstream release for testing which is based on Qt 5/KF 5. It remains masked until it is deemed suitable for wider use, but testing is appreciated. Adding an [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/kde.git/plain/profiles/package.mask/kdepim-16.08.0 unmask file] to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.unmask}} is necessary to get it.

==== Update to KDE PIM 16.08 and later ==== <!--T:113-->

<!--T:114-->
Most, but not all of the codebase has been ported from {{Package|dev-qt/qtwebkit}} to {{Package|dev-qt/qtwebengine}} which is based on Chromium's Blink. By default, this package sets and uses the <code>system-ffmpeg</code> USE flag, which comes down to a {{Package|media-video/ffmpeg}} package dependency, so users preferring {{Package|media-video/libav}} for the rest of their system will need to switch off that USE flag.

<!--T:115-->
Unfortunately, not all of the KDE Applications are compatible yet, with some packages still depending on Qt 4/KDElibs 4 based parts that can not be installed with modern KDE PIM at the same time. That includes {{Package|kde-apps/kopete}}, {{Package|kde-apps/kgpg}}, {{Package|kde-apps/kuser}} and possibly other packages outside of the kde-apps category. By default, these packages are not installed by {{Package|kde-apps/kde-apps-meta}} anymore.

<!--T:116-->
The following commands will deselect any packages from world that would still depend on these conflicting packages:

<!--T:117-->
{{RootCmd|equery -q d kde-apps/kdepim-common-libs &#124; sed -e "s/-[0-9].*//" &#124; xargs emerge --deselect
|equery -q d kde-apps/kdepimlibs &#124; sed -e "s/-[0-9].*//" &#124; xargs emerge --deselect
|equery -q d app-office/akonadi-server &#124; sed -e "s/-[0-9].*//" &#124; xargs emerge --deselect}}

<!--T:118-->
{{Note|This requires {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} to be installed. The [[Gentoolkit]] article provides more information about this useful utility.}}

<!--T:119-->
With all that prepared, KDE PIM is ready to be installed:

<!--T:120-->
{{Emerge|kde-apps/kdepim-meta}}

=== kdesu5 === <!--T:96-->

<!--T:97-->
The utility that is used to run GUI programs as {{c|root}} is provided by {{Package|kde-plasma/kde-cli-tools}}. If built with USE flag <code>kdesu</code>, a graphical frontend to {{Package|kde-frameworks/kdesu}} is installed, which can be used by invoking {{c|kdesu5}}.

<!--T:98-->
As always, ensure that the command actually needs to run as {{c|root}}, versus adding the regular user to the relevant groups or simply just running the command unprivileged.

== Plasma 4 == <!--T:62-->

<!--T:4-->
Plasma 4 is the previous major workspace version by KDE. Although it is no longer maintained upstream, it is considered stable and might still be a viable alternative for some.

<!--T:103-->
{{Warning|Users need to be aware that Plasma 4 has been end-of-life since 19th August 2015, meaning no security bugs have been fixed since then.}}

<!--T:53-->
Many useful widgets are in the {{Package|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}} package:

<!--T:54-->
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}}

=== Display manager === <!--T:36-->

<!--T:38-->
KDM (KDE Display Manager) is the long-serving login manager for Plasma 4 although any other login manager can be used.

<!--T:107-->
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdm}}

==== OpenRC ==== <!--T:39-->

<!--T:40-->
Set KDM as the default [[display manager]]:

<!--T:41-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
}}

<!--T:42-->
To start KDM on boot, add xdm to the default runlevel:

<!--T:43-->
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

<!--T:44-->
To start KDM now:

<!--T:45-->
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

==== systemd ==== <!--T:46-->

<!--T:47-->
Enable KDM at boot time through {{c|systemctl}}:

<!--T:48-->
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable kdm}}

<!--T:49-->
Now start the service:

<!--T:50-->
{{RootCmd|systemctl start kdm}}

== More KDE software == <!--T:55-->

<!--T:56-->
The most important KDE applications are in the portage tree and many are located in the [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-apps kde-apps] and [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-misc kde-misc] categories.
