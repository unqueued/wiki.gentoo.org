KDE is a powerful graphical desktop environment for Unix workstations.

In Gentoo there are 3 packages that will emerge a KDE environment, {{Package|kde-base/kde-meta}}, the full KDE suite, {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}, a bare KDE environment(no KDE applications) and {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-startkde}}, A very minimal KDE environment(no KDE applications or artwork). Its usually a good idea to start with {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}} and emerge whatever else you need as you go.

== Installation ==
Before you start the emerge make sure you have the USE flags '''consolekit''', '''policykit''', '''dbus''' and '''udev''' enabled globally, if you are using a desktop/kde or plain desktop profile they are enabled by said profile.

KDE pulls in some packages that are quite heavy, {{Package|dev-libs/boost}}, {{Package|x11-libs/qt-webkit}}, {{Package|x11-libs/qt-gui}} to name but a few, so the emerge will probably take awhile.
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}

There are other meta packages that can be installed to pull in parts of the KDE suite:
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeaccessibility-meta}}
:Accessibility applications and utilities.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeadmin-meta}}
:Administrative utilities, pulls in tools such as {{Package|kde-base/kuser}}, {{Package|kde-base/kcron}}, etc. which helps you manage your system.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeartwork-meta}}
:Extra themes, screensavers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebindings-meta}}
:Bindings for various languages.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeedu-meta}}
:Educational applications and "games".
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegames-meta}}
:Standard array of desktop games.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegraphics-meta}}
:Graphics applications such as image viewers, color pickers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdemultimedia-meta}}
:Audio and video playback applications and services.

:Network applications such as {{Package|kde-base/kopete}} and VNC services.

:Various development tools.
