'''KDE''' is a powerful graphical desktop environment for Unix workstations.

== Available versions ==
KDE SC 4 is the current KDE version supported by upstream. In Portage there is a stable version, and there might be one (or more) non-stable versions. Under normal conditions new versions get in stabilized after a month. In addition, KDE upstream provides [http://quickgit.kde.org/ live git source repositories]. The Gentoo KDE team provides trunk and latest branch live ebuilds through the [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/kde.git;a=summary kde overlay]. 

Choose what KDE SC version is most appropriate for you:

{{Note|Users with stable systems need to put [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p{{=}}proj/kde.git;a{{=}}blob_plain;f{{=}}Documentation/package.keywords/kde-4.9.keywords this keywords file] in /etc/portage/package.keywords to emerge testing versions.}}

{{Warning|If you are running KDEPIM and upgrade from 4.4 to 4.9, please have a look at the [[KDE/KDEPIM-4.7_upgrade|Gentoo Wiki KDEPIM 4.7 Upgrade Guide]] first (it still applies to 4.9)! If you want to stick with KDEPIM 4.4 you can [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/kde/kdepim-4.7-mask.txt mask KDEPIM 4.9].}}

== Prerequisites ==

=== Profile ===
The Desktop [[profile]]  has been split to KDE and GNOME subprofiles. This means that KDE and GNOME specific USE flags have been stripped from the basic desktop profile and have been migrated to the subprofiles. Choosing a subprofile does not restrict you to use only the equivalent desktop environment. In order to choose the profile that suits you, run 
{{RootCmd|eselect profile list}}
to get the profile list, and 
{{RootCmd|eselect profile set X}}
where X is the appropriate number of the profile you want to select. See the page on [[profile|profiles]] for more details.
For a full KDE desktop environment we recommend to use the ''desktop/kde'' [[profile]], which is specially tailored for KDE. 

=== Services ===
Before you install KDE SC it is recommended that you set up several services. Part of that is done automatically if you use a ''desktop/kde'' or ''desktop'' [[profile]]. In detail you should use: 
* [[ConsoleKit]]: Enables the consolekit framework for defining and tracking users, login sessions and seats.
* [[D-Bus]]: Enables use of the dbus message bus system.
* [[polkit]]: Enables the polkit framework for controlling privileges for system-wide services.
* [[udev]]: Enables support for udev Linux dynamic and persistent device naming.
* [[udisks]]: Enables support for some storage related services.

Follow the links for information how to set up these services. Note that other USE flag combinations than set in this profile may technically be possible (especially if you do not run a full KDE DE but only selected applications), but may be unsupported, untested, or lead to unexpected loss of functionality.

== Installation ==
{{Note|For live versions see the [[KDE/Overlay|''kde'' overlay]] article.}}

=== Packages ===
In Gentoo there are various packages that will install a KDE environment:
* {{Package|kde-base/kde-meta}}, the full KDE suite
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}, a basic KDE environment
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-startkde}}, a very minimal, effectively unsupported KDE environment (no KDE applications or artwork)
It's usually a good idea to start with {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}} and emerge whatever else you need as you go:
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}

There are other meta packages that can be installed to pull in parts of the KDE suite:
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeaccessibility-meta}}: Accessibility applications and utilities.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeadmin-meta}}: Administrative utilities, which helps you manage your system.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeartwork-meta}}: Extra themes, screensavers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebindings-meta}}: Bindings for various languages.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeedu-meta}} :Educational applications and "games".
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegames-meta}}: Standard desktop games.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegraphics-meta}}: Graphics applications such as image viewers, color pickers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdemultimedia-meta}}: Audio and video playback applications and services.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdenetwork-meta}}: Network applications and VNC services.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-meta}}: PIM applications such as emailer, addressbook, organizer, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdesdk-meta}}: Various development tools.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdetoys-meta}}: Toy like applications.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeutils-meta}}: Standard desktop utilities such as a archiver, a calculator, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdewebdev-meta}}: Web development tools.

=== Localization ===
For [[localization]] of KDE install {{Package|kde-base/kde-l10n}}. If you want only selected languages, define beforehand the ''LINGUAS'' USE flag:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
LINGUAS="de"
</pre>}}
{{Emerge|kde-base/kde-l10n}}

For localization of packages included in {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-meta}} you need to install {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-l10n}}, too:
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdepim-l10n}}

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===
Set KDM as your display manager:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
</pre>}}

You can now start KDE:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}
To start KDE at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm}}

== Addon Software ==

=== Widgets ===
Many useful widget are in the {{Package|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}} package:
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}}

=== More KDE software ===
The most important KDE programs are in the portage tree and are mostly located in the [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-base kde-base] and [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-misc kde-misc] categories.
