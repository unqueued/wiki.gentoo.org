'''KDE''' is a powerful graphical desktop environment for Unix workstations.

== Available versions ==
KDE SC 4 is the current KDE version supported by upstream. In Portage there is a stable version, and there might be one (or more) non-stable versions. Under normal conditions new versions get in stabilized after a month. In addition, KDE upstream provides [http://quickgit.kde.org/ live git source repositories]. The Gentoo KDE team provides trunk and latest branch live ebuilds through the [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/kde.git;a=summary kde overlay]. 


== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===
It is recommend to use the ''desktop/kde'' [[profile]], which is specially tailored for KDE. In every case follow these articles to setup required system services:
* [[udev]]
* [[D-Bus]]
* [[ConsoleKit]]
* [[polkit]]

Note that other USE flag combinations may technically be possible, but may be unsupported, untested, or lead to unexpected loss of functionality.

=== Software ===
In Gentoo there are 3 packages that will install a KDE environment:
* {{Package|kde-base/kde-meta}}, the full KDE suite
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}, a basic KDE environment
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-startkde}}, a very minimal KDE environment (no KDE applications or artwork)
It's usually a good idea to start with {{Package|kde-base/kdebase-meta}} and emerge whatever else you need as you go:
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdebase-meta}}


There are other meta packages that can be installed to pull in parts of the KDE suite:
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeaccessibility-meta}}: Accessibility applications and utilities.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeadmin-meta}}: Administrative utilities, which helps you manage your system.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeartwork-meta}}: Extra themes, screensavers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdebindings-meta}}: Bindings for various languages.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeedu-meta}} :Educational applications and "games".
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegames-meta}}: Standard desktop games.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdegraphics-meta}}: Graphics applications such as image viewers, color pickers, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdemultimedia-meta}}: Audio and video playback applications and services.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdenetwork-meta}}: Network applications and VNC services.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-meta}}: PIM applications such as emailer, addressbook, organizer, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdesdk-meta}}: Various development tools.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdetoys-meta}}: Toy like applications.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdeutils-meta}}: Standard desktop utilities such as a archiver, a calculator, etc.
* {{Package|kde-base/kdewebdev-meta}}: Web development tools.

=== Localization ===
For [[localization]] of KDE install {{Package|kde-base/kde-l10n}}. If you want only selected languages, define beforehand the ''LINGUAS'' USE flag:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
LINGUAS="de"
</pre>}}
{{Emerge|kde-base/kde-l10n}}

For localization of packages included in {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-meta}} you need to install {{Package|kde-base/kdepim-l10n}}, too:
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdepim-l10n}}

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===
Set KDM as your display manager:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
</pre>}}

You can now start KDE:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}
To start KDE at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm}}

== Addon Software ==

=== Widgets ===
Many useful widget are in the {{Package|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}} package:
{{Emerge|kde-base/kdeplasma-addons}}

=== More KDE software ===
The most important KDE programs are in the portage tree and are mostly located in the [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-base kde-base] and [http://packages.gentoo.org/category/kde-misc kde-misc] categories.
