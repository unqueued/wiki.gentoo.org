fdupes is a tool for identifying duplicate files across a set of directories. It works by scanning the specified directories for files, running {{c|md5sum}} on those files, then running a byte-by-btye comparison on the files. It can work in tandem with [[duperemove]], a deduplication tool for [[btrfs]].

=== Invocation ===

{{Cmd|fdupes -h|output=<pre>
Usage: fdupes [options] DIRECTORY...

 -r --recurse     	for every directory given follow subdirectories
                  	encountered within
 -R --recurse:    	for each directory given after this option follow
                  	subdirectories encountered within
 -s --symlinks    	follow symlinks
 -H --hardlinks   	normally, when two or more files point to the same
                  	disk area they are treated as non-duplicates; this
                  	option will change this behavior
 -n --noempty     	exclude zero-length files from consideration
 -f --omitfirst   	omit the first file in each set of matches
 -1 --sameline    	list each set of matches on a single line
 -S --size        	show size of duplicate files
 -m --summarize   	summarize dupe information
 -q --quiet       	hide progress indicator
 -d --delete      	prompt user for files to preserve and delete all
                  	others; important: under particular circumstances,
                  	data may be lost when using this option together
                  	with -s or --symlinks, or when specifying a
                  	particular directory more than once; refer to the
                  	fdupes documentation for additional information
 -N --noprompt    	together with --delete, preserve the first file in
                  	each set of duplicates and delete the rest without
                  	prompting the user
 -v --version     	display fdupes version
 -h --help        	display this help message
