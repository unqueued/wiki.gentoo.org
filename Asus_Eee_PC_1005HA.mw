The Asus Eee PC 1005HA is a laptop manufactured by Asus in 2009. It features an Intel Atom N280 with 1GB of RAM (upgradable to 2GB), a 160GB hard disk, and a Mobile Intel 945ME Express with 250MB of VRAM.

This article supplements the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml Gentoo Linux x86 Handbook] with specific information regarding the Eee PC 1005HA.

Kernel configuration is based on the {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}-3.0.6.

=== Choosing the right install medium ===
As the Eee PC 1005HA does not have a CD/DVD drive, the easiest way to install Gentoo is using a LiveUSB. Follow the instructions given in the [[LiveUSB/HOWTO|Gentoo Linux LiveUSB HOWTO]].

The ath9k module that ships with the gentoo-minimal disk image has not been compiled with PCI support, which means wireless networking is not available during install. As a Gentoo install is dependent on a network connection, either install over ethernet (atl1c driver is supported), use another distro to install (e.g. [http://www.sysresccd.org/ System Rescue CD]), or recompile the ath9k module for a custom LiveUSB.

To boot from a LiveUSB press {{Key|Esc}} as the machine powers on, then select the appropriate device from the list presented. If Boot Booster is enabled (see later), first enter the BIOS configuration by pressing {{Key|F2}} as the machine powers on, then exit without saving changes by pressing {{Key|F10}}, then press {{Key|Esc}} as described previously.

=== Partitioning===
Follow the guidance on partitioning as given in the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml handbook], with the following exception to enable Boot Booster:

==== Boot Booster ====
The Asus Eee PC 1005HA features a technology called Boot Booster, which can reduce boot times by a few seconds by caching the results of the [[Wikipedia:Power-on self-test|POST]] on the hard disk. When partitioning the internal hard disk, create a 16MB primary partition of type EFI (0xEF). The location on the disk is unimportant but the partition must be a primary one. The system does not boot using the EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface), but rather uses the partition type to identify which partition to read/write the cache.

The example fdisk output below shows a 100MB boot partition, a 16MB EFI partition (for Boot Booster) a 2GB swap partition and a ~147GB partition for the rest of the system.
{{RootCmd|fdisk -l|output=<pre>
Disk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes

Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

/dev/sda2          206848      239615       16384   ef  EFI (FAT-12/16/32)

/dev/sda4         4433920   312581807   154073944   83  Linux
</pre>}}

Boot Booster must also be enabled in the BIOS configuration.

== Hardware ==

=== CPU ===
The CPU is an Intel Atom N280.
{{KernelBox|title=Processor support|1=

    [*] Machine Check / overheating reporting

    [*]   Intel microcode patch loading support
}}
To update the processor microcode, install {{Package|sys-apps/microcode-ctl}}.
{{Emerge|sys-apps/microcode-ctl}}
The microcode patch will be lost at each reboot, but the init script can reload it.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/microcode_ctl start|rc-update add microcode_ctl boot}}
In this example, the microcode is updated from version 0x212 to 0x218.
{{RootCmd|dmesg <nowiki>|</nowiki> grep microcode|output=<pre>
