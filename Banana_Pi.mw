The Banana Pi embedded system is very similar to the [[Raspberry Pi]]. 

== Lemakers Gentoo Image ==
Download the compressed image file from http://www.lemaker.org/mirror and extract it. 

{{Cmd
| tar xfzv Gentoo_For_BananaPro_v1412.tgz}}

Connect a compatible SD card, or a SATA 2.5" harddisc with your computer. 
Lets assume the device is named {{Path|/dev/sdx}}. Write the image to the media with dd

{{Cmd
| sudo dd if{{=}}Gentoo_For_BananaPro_v1412.img of{{=}}/dev/sdx bs{{=}}1M}}

== Manual Gentoo installation on SDD ==
Boot a Gentoo system (for example the Lemaker image) from SD card. 
Follow to the installation procedure in the [[Handbook:AMD64| amd64 manual]] 
but download and use an ARMv7a stage3 file from https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/ instead of the amd64 version.
