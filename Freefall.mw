{{Lowercase title}}
'''hpfall''' is a simple daemon providing HDD shock protection for HP laptops supporting the feature officially called "HP Mobile Data Protection System 3D" or "HP 3D DriveGuard".

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel option either as built-in or module.
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device drivers --->
    [*] X86 Platform Specific Device Drivers  --->
        <*> HP laptop accelerometer
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
The hpfall daemon and init script can be found in {{Package|sys-apps/linux-misc-apps}}:
{{Emerge|linux-misc-apps}}

== Configuration ==
Set your HDD in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/hpfall.conf}}.

=== Service ===
You can now start hpfall:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/hpfall start}}

To start hpfall at boot time, add it to your boot runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add hpfall boot}}

== Testing ==
After reboot with new kernel, check if hp_accel driver was initialised correctly
{{Cmd|dmesg &#124; grep hp_accel}}

=== Testing Shock protection ===
{{Warning|Be careful while performing this test and keep your laptop over something soft. Simulating free fall over the desk is bad idea.}}
Find your HDD's unload_heads file:
{{Cmd|find /sys -name unload_heads}}
Go to it's directory and run:
{{Cmd|watch --difference{{=}}permanent cat unload_heads}}

Lift you laptop into free space and simulate the free fall while holding it firmly with your hands. About 10 cm should be enough.
If the disk protection works then you should hear your HDD making "click" sound, see one of your laptop's LEDs flashing and the watch value's background should permanently turn black.
