The '''metadata/layout.conf''' file is a file describing global properties of a repository.

== File format ==

The file consists of a number of key-value pairs, one pair per line, with the two separated by =. Comment lines start with #.

{{File|metadata/layout.conf|An example showing the format of the file|<pre>
key1 = value1
# comment
key2 = value2
</pre>}}

== Possible keys ==

=== masters ===

The ''masters'' key specifies a list of master repositories for this particular repository. Whenever installing an ebuild from the particular repository, package manager can use eclasses from the master repositories.

The most common example is a repository (overlay) which provides additional packages for Gentoo. Such a package uses eclasses from the ''gentoo'' repository.

{{File|metadata/layout.conf|An example for repository relying on ''gentoo'' eclasses|<pre>
masters = gentoo
</pre>}}

A particular repository may have more than a single ''masters'' entry. These are not inherited over repositories.

{{File|metadata/layout.conf|An example for repository relying on two other repositories|<pre>
masters = python gentoo
</pre>}}

Finally, a stand-alone repository like ''gentoo'' should provide an empty masters list. This means that all eclasses used by packages in that repository must be found in that repository.

masters =
