Since we are considering adding new dependency types, few developers are suggesting we should adopt exheres-0 single ''DEPENDENCIES'' variable.

A copy-paste from [http://www.exherbo.org/docs/exheres-for-smarties.html#dependencies Exheres for smarties]:

    DEPENDENCIES="
        build+run:
            foo/bar
        run:
            foo/baz
        post:
            foo/monkey
    "

And:

    DEPENDENCIES="
        blah? ( cat/build-and-run )
        foo? (
            cat/build-and-run
            build:
                cat/build-only
            run:
                cat/run-only
                bar? (
                    cat/run-only
                    post:
                        cat/post-only
                )
                cat/run-only-again
        )
        cat/build-and-run"

Shortly saying:
* ''foo:'' starts a block of dependencies of type ''foo'',
* ''foo+bar+baz:'' means that the listed package belong to ''foo'', ''bar'' and ''baz''-type dependencies at the same time,
* the default block is ''build+run'',
* blocks are scoped to the enclosing braces.

Advantages:
* easier way of specifying common dependencies in really weird cases,
* ability to replace one-letter-DEPEND variables with a long, human-readable labels.

Disadvantages:
* necessity of rewriting whole ''*DEPEND'' when migrating to the new EAPI,
* necessity of handling two different dependency syntaxes in eclasses,
* added complexity to the dependency syntax parser (and it is spooky already),
* necessity of converting the new block to old-style dependencies -- for compatibility with external tools,
* reinventing the wheel -- introducing a new syntax to avoid proper use of bash variables.
