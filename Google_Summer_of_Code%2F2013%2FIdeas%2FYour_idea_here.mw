|Your idea here|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Our best proposals, and a significant proportion of our total acceptances every year, come from student-initiated ideas rather than those suggested by Gentoo developers. We highly encourage you to suggest your own idea based on what you think would make Gentoo a better distribution. If you do so, we strongly recommend you work with a potential mentor to develop your idea before proposing it formally. You can find a potential mentor by contacting Donnie or via discussion on the gentoo-soc mailing list or #gentoo-soc IRC channel.|
