Under certain circumstances it might be convenient to set a default root password. For example when deploying Gentoo cross-platform trying to [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Base#Chrooting|chroot in the common way]] may return an {{c|exec format error}}. If the [[Knowledge_Base:Chrooting returns exec format error|respective entry in the Knowledge Base]] does not apply chances are that using a [[Embedded_Handbook/General/Compiling with qemu user chroot|QEMU user chroot]] instead of the standard procedure is indicated. In that case circumventing the necessity of chrooting may spare a lot of efforts. Setting a default root password is integral to that circumvention.

{{Warning|Don't do this lightheartedly as it always carries a certain security risk should one forget to change the root password as soon as indicated adequate. At least consider using a [[Embedded_Handbook/General/Compiling with qemu user chroot|QEMU user chroot]].}}

To set a default root password the file {{Path|TARGET/etc/shadow}} needs to be manipulated.

== Hash (and salt) the password ==

Since passwords may not be stored in plaintext use openssl to convert the password:

{{Cmd|openssl passwd -6|output=<pre>Password:
Verifying - Password:
$6$I9Q9AyTL$Z76H7wD8mT9JAyrp/vaYyFwyA5wRVN0tze8pvM.MqScC7BBm2PU7pLL0h5nSxueqUpYAlZTox4Ag2Dp5vchjJ0</pre>}}

In this example the string corresponds to the password "gentoo".

== Option 1: Edit {{Path|shadow}} by hand ==

{{Note|{{Path|TARGET}} needs to be replaced by the mountpoint of the target root filesystem.}}

The resulting string needs to be placed in {{Path|TARGET/etc/shadow}}. In that file replace the line beginning with <code>root:</code> with the line shown below, substituting {{c|SHADOW_COMMAND_OUTPUT}} with the string obtained before.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/shadow|1=
root:SHADOW_COMMAND_OUTPUT:14698:0:::::
}}

In case of the example with password "gentoo" it would look like that:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/shadow|1=
root:$6$I9Q9AyTL$Z76H7wD8mT9JAyrp/vaYyFwyA5wRVN0tze8pvM.MqScC7BBm2PU7pLL0h5nSxueqUpYAlZTox4Ag2Dp5vchjJ0:14698:0:::::
}}

== Option 2: Use {{c|sed}} to manipulate {{Path|shadow}} ==

The resulting string needs to be placed in {{Path|TARGET/etc/shadow}}. First escape [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_basic_and_extended Basic Regular Expressions] in the string provided by the {{c|openssl}} command before, that is precede each of the characters <code>$.*[\^/&</code> by <code>\</code>.

In the following command substitute {{c|MODIFIED_SHADOW_COMMAND_OUTPUT}} with that modified string.

{{Note|{{Path|TARGET}} needs to be replaced by the mountpoint of the target root filesystem.}}

{{RootCmd
|sed -i 's/root\:\*/root\:\MODIFIED_SHADOW_COMMAND_OUTPUT/' TARGET/etc/shadow
}}

In case of the example with password "gentoo" this would look like that:

{{RootCmd
|sed -i 's/root\:\*/root\:\$6\$I9Q9AyTL\$Z76H7wD8mT9JAyrp\/vaYyFwyA5wRVN0tze8pvM\.MqScC7BBm2PU7pLL0h5nSxueqUpYAlZTox4Ag2Dp5vchjJ0/' TARGET/etc/shadow
}}
