Arduino is an open source development platform using atmel microprocessors. This document describes how to use arduino boards on gentoo.
==Prepare the kernel for USB connection==
The arduino boards will be connected via USB to the computer. With this connection it is possible to write binaries to the atmega microprocessor and get debug messages from the board during run mode. Different boards have different USB interface chips.
* Arduino NG -> FTDI
* Arduino MEGA (8U2, 16U2) -> [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/USB_CDC_ACM CDC ACM]
{{Kernel|for FTDI chip (can also be a module)|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support ---> 
    <*> USB Serial Converter support --->
    <*> USB FTDI Single Port Serial Driver
</pre>}}

{{Kernel|for CDC ACM (can also be a module)|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support ---> 
    <*> USB Modem (CDC ACM) support
</pre>}}

After booting with the new kernel this can be tested after connecting the board to the computers USB port:
{{RootCmd|dmesg}}
{{ContentBox|after connect an Arduino NG|<pre>
usb 5-4: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
</pre>}}
{{ContentBox|after connect an Arduino MEGA|<pre>
cdc_acm 5-4:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
</pre>}}

==Prepare the toolchain==
Because we need to compile code into binaries for another target platform (avr atmel microprocessors) we have to install an cross development toolchain.
We need three parts (Versions depend on your installation):
* cross-avr/gcc-4.6.3
* cross-avr/binutils-2.21.1
* avr-libc-1.8.0
this can be tested with:
{{RootCmd|emerge -p cross-avr/gcc cross-avr/binutils cross-avr/avr-libc}}
===Install the toolchain using crossdev===
Basic installation is out of the scope of this article. Please read the [http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Crossdev gentoo crossdev manual] with special attention to the AVR section of the article.
===Install non gentoo toolchain===
Using the original [http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELAVRTOOLCHAINFORLINUX.aspx Atmel AVR toolchain] seems to be possible but not tested.

Using the debian precompiled toolchain is described there [http://blog.coldtobi.de/index.php?op=ViewArticle&articleId=21&blogId=1]

==Using arduino IDE==
At the moment arduino ide and uisp package are masked with ~amd64 keyword.<br />
This can be tested with:
{{RootCmd|emerge -p arduino}}

Create a file called arduino containing the necessary keywords. For example:
{{File|/etc/portage/package.mask/arduino||<pre>
=dev-embedded/arduino-1.0.3-r1 ~amd64
=dev-embedded/uisp-20050207-r1 ~amd64
</pre>}}

After the keywords are set correctly arduino can be installed with:
{{RootCmd|emerge arduino}}

{{Note|At the moment avrdude is merged as a dependency of arduino although the arduino ide seems to use its own avrdude package for downloading. Therefore don't take to much attention to gentoo's avrdude package.}}

After the start of arduino ide (an link should be found in the application/development section of your start menu) the scetchbook location should be configured.<br />
This is possible via the menu ''File/Preferences/Scetchbook location/''.

==Using eclipse IDE==
After installing eclipse IDE you can choose between two eclipse plugins. Plugins can be installed via provided update sites.
Simply add the given site via ''eclipse menu/help/software-updates/add-site''.
{{Note| Installation of eclipse IDE is out of the scope of this article. Please read [http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Eclipse Eclipse Wiki] for that topic.}}
{{Note|There are major changes since arduino installation version 1 (formerly versions were "022" etc.). Also major changes since arduino installation version 1.5.x where done.
Last but not least the plugin "Arduino Eclipse Extension" has reworked between version 1.2.4 and version 2.x to support the new arduino way [http://blog.baeyens.it/#home (more details there)] so the version 2.x is only compatible with eclipse juno (not helios and not indigo). Please choose the right version of eclipse for your needs!}}
===Arduino Eclipse Extension===
'''Arduino Eclipse Extension''' is a free eclipse plugin for arduino projects developed by Jantje. It depends on the installation of arduino IDE.<br />
Use the update site "http://www.baeyens.it/eclipse/update" for the installation of an plugin version which is compatible with '''arduino 1.0.4''' and eclipse '''helios''' and '''indigo'''.<br />
Use the update site "http://www.baeyens.it/eclipse/V2" for installation an plugin version which is compatible with '''arduino 1.5.x''' and eclipse '''juno'''.

===Avr eclipse plugin===
'''Avr eclipse plugin''' is a free eclipse plugin for developing boards with avr atmel microprocessors. It is not especially make for the arduino boards, but it can used for that. It is not necessary to install arduino IDE for using that plugin. More informations can be found on the [http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/The_AVR_Eclipse_Plugin wiki site].<br />
Use the update site "http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/updatesite/" for installation of the plugin which is known to work with eclipse '''helios'''
