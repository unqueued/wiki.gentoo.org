Arduino is an open source development platform using atmel microprocessors. This document describes how to use arduino boards on gentoo.
==Prepare the kernel for USB connection==
The arduino boards will be connected via USB to the computer. With this connection it is possible to write binaries to the atmega microprocessor and get debug messages from the board during run mode. Different boards have different USB interface chips. In case you prefer to use ICSP programming with an external adapter you don't need this for programming any more but eventually for debugging.
* Arduino NG -> FTDI
* Arduino MEGA and most of the others (8U2, 16U2, 32U4) -> [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/USB_CDC_ACM CDC ACM]
{{Kernel|for FTDI chip (can also be a module)|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support ---> 
      <*> USB Serial Converter support --->
        <*> USB FTDI Single Port Serial Driver
</pre>}}

{{Kernel|for CDC ACM (can also be a module)|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support ---> 
      <*> USB Modem (CDC ACM) support
</pre>}}

After booting with the new kernel this can be tested after connecting the board to the computers USB port:
{{RootCmd|dmesg}}
{{ContentBox|after connect an Arduino NG|<pre>
usb 5-4: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
</pre>}}
{{ContentBox|after connect an Arduino MEGA|<pre>
cdc_acm 5-4:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
</pre>}}

==Prepare the toolchain==
Because we need to compile code into binaries for another target platform (avr atmel microprocessors) we have to install an cross development toolchain.
We need three parts (Versions depend on your installation):
* cross-avr/gcc-4.6.3
* cross-avr/binutils-2.21.1-r1
* cross-avr/avr-libc-1.8.0
this can be tested with:
{{RootCmd|emerge -pvv cross-avr/gcc cross-avr/binutils cross-avr/avr-libc}}
If '''gcc''' is already installed please pay attention of the use flag '''multilib'''. This have to be '''activated'''.
===Install the toolchain using crossdev===
Basic installation is out of the scope of this article. Please read the [http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Crossdev gentoo crossdev manual] with special attention to the AVR section of the article.
===Install non gentoo toolchain===
Using the original [http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELAVRTOOLCHAINFORLINUX.aspx Atmel AVR toolchain] seems to be possible but not tested.

Using the debian precompiled toolchain is described there [http://blog.coldtobi.de/index.php?op=ViewArticle&articleId=21&blogId=1]

==Using arduino IDE==
At the moment arduino ide and uisp package are masked with ~amd64 keyword.<br />
This can be tested with:
{{RootCmd|emerge -p arduino}}

Create a file called arduino containing the necessary keywords. For example:
{{File|/etc/portage/package.mask/arduino||<pre>
=dev-embedded/arduino-1.0.3-r1 ~amd64
=dev-embedded/uisp-20050207-r1 ~amd64
</pre>}}

After the keywords are set correctly arduino can be installed with:
{{RootCmd|emerge arduino}}

{{Note|At the moment avrdude is merged as a dependency of arduino although the arduino ide seems to use its own avrdude package for downloading. Therefore don't take to much attention to gentoo's avrdude package.}}

After the start of arduino ide (an link should be found in the application/development section of your start menu) the scetchbook location should be configured.<br />
This is possible via the menu ''File/Preferences/Scetchbook location/''.

==Using eclipse IDE==
After installing eclipse IDE you can choose between two eclipse plugins. Plugins can be installed via provided update sites.
Simply add the given site via ''eclipse menu/help/software-updates/add-site''.
{{Note| Installation of eclipse IDE is out of the scope of this article. Please read [http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Eclipse Eclipse Wiki] for that topic.}}
{{Note|There are major changes since arduino installation version 1 (formerly versions were "022" etc.). Also major changes since arduino installation version 1.5.x where done.
Last but not least the plugin "Arduino Eclipse Extension" has reworked between version 1.2.4 and version 2.x to support the new arduino way [http://blog.baeyens.it/#home (more details there)] so the version 2.x is only compatible with eclipse juno (not helios and not indigo). Please choose the right version of eclipse for your needs!}}
===Arduino Eclipse Extension===
'''Arduino Eclipse Extension''' is a free eclipse plugin for arduino projects developed by Jantje. It depends on the installation of arduino IDE.<br />
Use the update site "http://www.baeyens.it/eclipse/update" for the installation of a plugin version which is compatible with '''arduino 1.0.4''' and eclipse '''helios''' and '''indigo'''.<br />
Use the update site "http://www.baeyens.it/eclipse/V2" for installation of a plugin version which is compatible with '''arduino 1.5.x''' and eclipse '''juno'''.

===AVR Eclipse Plugin===
'''AVR Eclipse Plugin''' is a free eclipse plugin for developing boards with avr atmel microprocessors. It is not especially make for the arduino boards, but it can used for that. It is not necessary to install arduino IDE for using that plugin. More informations can be found on the [http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/The_AVR_Eclipse_Plugin wiki site].<br />
Use the update site "http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/updatesite/" for installation of the plugin which is known to work with eclipse '''helios'''.
{{Note| V1 of the ''Arduino Eclipse Extension'' contains the ''AVR Eclipse Plugin'' as such you can not have both on your eclipse without confusion.
V2 no longer includes the ''AVR Eclipse Plugin'' so you can easily install ''AVR Eclipse Plugin'' next to the ''Arduino Eclipse Extension''.}}

== Tips and Tricks ==
===udev rule for Arduino NG===
This rule can be used to make an symlink '''/dev/arduino''', especially usefull in case of more than one arduino boards.<br />
For example create an file ''12-mikrocontroller.rules'' and add the line below:
{{File|/etc/udev/rules.d/12-mikrocontroller.rules||<pre>
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{product}=="FT232R USB UART", ATTRS{manufacturer}=="FTDI", NAME="ttyUSB%n", SYMLINK+="arduino"
</pre>}}
===udev rule for Arduino MEGA===
This rule can be used to make an symlink '''/dev/arduino''', especially usefull in case of more than one arduino boards.<br />
For example create an file ''12-mikrocontroller.rules'' and add the line below:
{{File|/etc/udev/rules.d/12-mikrocontroller.rules||<pre>
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{product}=="Arduino Mega 2560", ATTRS{manufacturer}=="Arduino (www.arduino.cc)", NAME="ttyACM%n", SYMLINK+="arduino"
</pre>}}

== Troubleshooting ==
=== Known [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147155 Bug 147155]===
If you can see the message below you have found an already known bug.
{{ContentBox|Error while compilation|<pre>/usr/libexec/gcc/avr/ld: cannot open linker script file ldscripts/avr5.x: No such file or directory
</pre>}}
To fix this create a symlink so that arduino will find ldscripts:
{{RootCmd|ln -s /usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/avr/lib/ldscripts /usr/avr/lib/ldscripts}}

=== Problem with deprecated items in avr-libc v1.8.0 and above (and Mega 2560)===
If you can see the messages below you have found this compatibility issue ([http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,92364.0.html arduino forum]).
{{ContentBox|Errors while compilation|<pre>/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.cpp:107:41: error: attempt to use poisoned "SIG_USART0_RECV"
/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.cpp:117:15: error: attempt to use poisoned "SIG_USART0_RECV"
/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.cpp:161:15: error: attempt to use poisoned "SIG_USART0_RECV"
/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.cpp:178:15: error: attempt to use poisoned "SIG_USART0_RECV"
/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.cpp:195:15: error: attempt to use poisoned "SIG_USART0_RECV"
</pre>}}
To fix this manipulate your '''Arduino.h''' at the third line:
{{File|/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/Arduino.h||<pre>
#ifndef Arduino_h
#define Arduino_h
//start: fix the compatibility issue
#define __AVR_LIBC_DEPRECATED_ENABLE__ 1
//end: fix the compatibility issue
#include <stdlib.h>
...
</pre>}}
