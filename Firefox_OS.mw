This page details how to build Firefox OS on Gentoo

==Requirements==
===Phone===
* Obviously, you will need a smartphone supported by Firefox OS, see list [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites here].
* adb/fastboot must work on your phone, you may need to unlock it to allow it
===Gentoo===
==== Packages ====
Quite a few packages are required to build Firefox OS, so we might as well create a set for it

=====gcc=====
Firefox OS requires gcc 4.6, it will not build with any other version. This may change in the future but for now we need gcc 4.6

=====ccache=====
Mozilla says ccache is required, but it's not.<br/>Using ccache AND forcing the gcc version does not fit well with the way Firefox OS builds, so it is best to forget ccache.
