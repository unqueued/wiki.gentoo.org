This page details how to build Firefox OS on Gentoo

==Requirements==
===Phone===
* Obviously, you will need a smartphone supported by Firefox OS, see list [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites here].
* adb/fastboot must work on your phone, you may need to unlock it to allow that.
===Computer===
* 64bit install (at least Mozilla thinks so)
* 4GB of RAM
* 30GB of disk space (sources alone are 14GB)

==Packages==
Firefox OS requires gcc 4.6, it will not build with any other version. This may change in the future but for now we need gcc 4.6

Mozilla says ccache is required, but it's not.<br/>Using ccache AND forcing the gcc version does not fit well with the way Firefox OS builds, so it is best to forget ccache.

Quite a few other packages are required, so we might as well create a set.

{{file|/etc/portage/sets/firefox_os|@firefox_os set|<pre>
# see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites
=sys-devel/autoconf-2.13
sys-devel/bison
app-arch/bzip2
# dev-util/ccache 
net-misc/curl
sys-devel/flex
sys-apps/gawk
dev-vcs/git
=sys-devel/gcc-4.6.3  # or any other 4.6
sys-devel/make
sys-devel/patch
media-libs/mesa
x11-libs/libX11
sys-libs/ncurses 
sys-libs/zlib
dev-util/android-tools 
</pre>}}

You also need the 32bit versions of ncurses and zlib
{{file|/etc/portage/package.use/firefox_os||<pre>sys-libs/ncurses abi_x86_32
sys-libs/zlib abi_x86_32</pre>}}

{{Emerge|@firefox_os}}

==Udev==
Unless you want to use adb/fastboot as root, you may need to add a rule to udev (and have your user be part of the plugdev group)
{{file|/etc/udev/rules.d/firefox_os.rules||<pre>SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="19d2", ATTR{idProduct}=="1351", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"</pre>}}
{{note|replace 19d2 and 1351 (ZTE Open) by the values of your phone, they can be obtained with lsusb}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/udev restart}}


Now adb should be able to detect your phone
{{Cmd|adb devices|output=<pre>
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached 
roamer2 device</pre>}}


You won't be able to flash your phone if adb/fastboot is not working
