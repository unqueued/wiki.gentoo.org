This page details how to build Firefox OS on Gentoo

==Requirements==
===Phone===
* Obviously, you will need a smartphone supported by Firefox OS, see list [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites here].
* adb/fastboot must work on your phone, you may need to unlock it to allow that.
=== Packages ===
You need to be on a 64bit install (at least Mozilla thinks so)

Firefox OS requires gcc 4.6, it will not build with any other version. This may change in the future but for now we need gcc 4.6

Mozilla says ccache is required, but it's not.<br/>Using ccache AND forcing the gcc version does not fit well with the way Firefox OS builds, so it is best to forget ccache.

Quite a few other packages are required to build Firefox OS, so we might as well create a set for it.

{{Emerge|@firefox_os}}

You need the 32bit versions of ncurses and zlib, you should activate ABI_X86 for these packages

===Other===
You also need:
* 4GB of RAM
* 30GB of disk space (sources alone are 14GB)
* A lot of time, be it to download the sources or to compile them
