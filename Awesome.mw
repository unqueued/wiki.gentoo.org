'''Awesome''' is a highly configurable, next generation framework window manager for X. It is primarly targeted at power users, developers and any people dealing with every day computing tasks and who want to have fine-grained control on theirs graphical environment.

== Installation ==
{{RootCmd|emerge -av x11-wm/awesome}}

== Configuration ==
The default configuration file of '''Awesome''' is located in '''''~/.config/awesome/rc.lua'''''. If such a directory or file does not exist we will need to create them.

=== Creating the configuration ===
A default, out of the box, configuration is distributed with '''Awesome''' and can be found at '''''/etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua'''''. We would need to copy that configuration file to the user home directory.<br \>
First we create the '''awesome''' directory with the following command:
{{Cmd| mkdir ~/.config/awesome/}}
Then we copy the ''lua'' configuration file with the following command:
{{Cmd| cp /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua}}

=== Launch ===
If '''awesome''' is going to launched from terminal through '''''startx''''' a configuration similar to the following is needed:
{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>
<nowiki>exec /usr/bin/ck-launch-session /usr/bin/dbus-launch /usr/bin/awesome
</nowiki></pre>
}}
==== Touchpad ====
If a '''Touchpad''' hardware is present and scrolling does not work ''.xinitrc'' should look similar to the following:
{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>
<nowiki>synclient HorizEdgeScroll=1
synclient VertEdgeScroll=1
synclient TapButton1=1
exec /usr/bin/ck-launch-session /usr/bin/dbus-launch /usr/bin/awesome</nowiki></pre>
}}

{{Note| '''synclient''' belongs to {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics}}}}
