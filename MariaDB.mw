'''MariaDB''' An enhanced, drop-in replacement for [[MySQL]].

In Gentoo, {{Package|dev-db/mariadb}} is the default package for items that depend on {{Package|virtual/mysql}}.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=dev-db/mariadb}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|dev-db/mariadb}}:

{{Emerge|mariadb}}

=== Service ===
* OpenRC:
: To have the database(s) started automatically at boot, add it to the default runlevel:

: {{RootCmd|rc-update add mysql default}}

: If the database is configured, start the service:

: {{RootCmd|rc-service mysql start}}

* Systemd:

:* With MariaDB < 10.1
:: {{RootCmd|systemctl enable mysqld.service}}
:* With MariaDB >= 10.1.8
:: As of MariaDB 10.1.8, it includes a notify based unit to use instead a script to check if the system is alive.
:: {{RootCmd|systemctl enable mariadb.service}}

== Configuration ==

=== Preliminary configuration ===

Gentoo MariaDB package maintainers will help you set up MariaDB through the configuration option in the ebuild.

{{RootCmd|emerge --config dev-db/mariadb}}

The configuration will create a database, set proper permissions, and assist you in creating a secure root password (this is for the MariaDB root account, which is not related to the Linux root account).

=== In-database configuration ===

When the database is set up and running, connect to MariaDB using the {{c|mysql}} client application.

{{Cmd|mysql -u root -p -h localhost|output=<pre>
Enter root password: 
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MariaDB connection id is 86415
Server version: 5.5.32-MariaDB-log Source distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MariaDB [(none)]></pre>}}

=== Custom options ===

Beginning with MariaDB 10.2, the configuration file {{Path|my.cnf}}, includes a single directive to include {{Path|/etc/mysql/mariadb.d}} and all files located within.  Gentoo includes a file for server settings and one for client settings.  Create your own files in this directory and they will be added together in alphabetical order.  The base configuration accepts almost all the defaults and only tweaks paths.  Tune your server to your liking.
