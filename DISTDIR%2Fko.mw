'''DISTDIR 변수는 포티지가 다운로드한 소스 코드를 어디에 저장할지 저장할 위치를 지정합니다. 기본값은 {{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles}} 입니다'''.

This location, which is also often referred to as the ''distfiles'' location, will host the source code archives of all software ever installed (or attempted to install) on the system. This location is not automatically cleaned up though, so you might want to use tools such as '''eclean-dist''' (part of {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}) to keep the storage used by this location under control. Please read the [[Eclean]] article for more details.

Users can set this variable in <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code>.
