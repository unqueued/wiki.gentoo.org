<var>DISTDIR</var> 변수는 포티지가 다운로드한 소스 코드를 어디에 저장할지 저장할 위치를 지정합니다. 기본값은 {{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles}} 입니다.

This location, which is also often referred to as the ''distfiles'' location, will host the source code archives of all software installed (or attempted to install) on the system. This location is not automatically cleaned up, so users should consider using tools such as the {{c|eclean-dist}} command (which comes as part of the {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} package) to keep the storage used by this location under control. Read the [[Eclean|Eclean article]] for more details.

Users can set the <var>DISTDIR</var> variable in [[:/etc/portage/make.conf|{{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}]]
