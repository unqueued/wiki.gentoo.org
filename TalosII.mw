== Installation ==
The system uses [https://github.com/open-power/petitboot petitboot] as main bootloader. The grub based ppc64le install media iso contents can be copied to a partition of an usb storage and used.

Make sure to pass '''console=hvc0''' as boot argument if you are using the OpenBMC console.

=== OpenBMC ===
The [https://www.openbmc.org/ openbmc] will ask for an address if the first eth port is connected.
It would listen to port 22 and port 2200. Petitboot will be directly reachable from port 2200.

=== Kernel ===

Use powernv_defconfig.

{{KernelBox|title=Enable support for these hardware drivers|1=

Write menuconfig instructions here.

To enable hardware accelerated virtualisation:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable hardware virtualisation, kvm_hv|1=

--- Virtualization
<M>   KVM support for PowerPC book3s_64 processors
<M>     KVM for POWER7 and later using hypervisor mode in host
< >     KVM support without using hypervisor mode in host
}}

=== Emerge ===

(Optional section. If the platform requires any user space packages or kernel patches, mention them here).

{{Emerge|category/package}}

== Configuration ==

(Explain any additional configuration or special customization for this hardware platform. Could be anything from BIOS settings to assigning proper media key functionality.)

=== Bootloader ===

The Talos uses petitboot as part of it's firmware and bootloader. This means there is no need to install grub/yaboot/etc, as all petitboot needs is the config file. kboot has a delightfully simple config format, which is easily written.

== Troubleshooting ==

(Optional section.)

(Troubleshoot issues in this section. Separate issues by best describing the error with a new section name. Remove this section and subsections if no issues are known.)

=== Issue 1 ===

When X happens, Y is how you fix it.
