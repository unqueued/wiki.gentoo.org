== Configuration ==

(Explain any additional configuration or special customization for this hardware platform. Could be anything from BIOS settings to assigning proper media key functionality.)

=== Bootloader ===

The Talos uses petitboot as part of it's firmware and bootloader. This means there is no need to install grub/yaboot/etc, as all petitboot needs is the config file. kboot has a delightfully simple config format, which is easily written.
