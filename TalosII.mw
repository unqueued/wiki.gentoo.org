== Installation ==
The system uses [https://github.com/open-power/petitboot petitboot] as main bootloader. The grub based ppc64le install media iso contents can be copied to a partition of an usb storage and used.

Make sure to pass '''console=hvc0''' as boot argument if you are using the OpenBMC console.

=== OpenBMC ===
The [https://www.openbmc.org/ openbmc] will ask for an address if the first Ethernet port is connected.
It would listen to port 22 and port 2200. Petitboot will be directly reachable from port 2200.

=== Kernel ===

Use powernv_defconfig.

To enable hardware accelerated virtualization:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable hardware virtualization, kvm_hv|1=

--- Virtualization
<M>   KVM support for PowerPC book3s_64 processors
<M>     KVM for POWER7 and later using hypervisor mode in host
< >     KVM support without using hypervisor mode in host
}}

== Configuration ==

=== Bootloader ===

The Talos uses petitboot as part of its firmware and bootloader. This means there is no need to install grub/yaboot/etc, as all petitboot needs is the config file. kboot has a delightfully simple config format, which is easily written.
