'''PulseAudio''' (or '''PA''' for short) is a sound server that provides a number of features on top of the low-level audio interface [[ALSA]] on Linux, such as:
* Networking support (P2P and server mode).
* Per-application volume controls
* Better cross-platform support
* Dynamic latency adjustment, which can be used to save power

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===
PulseAudio uses [[udev]] and [[ConsoleKit]], so set them up first.

=== Kernel ===
If you have an Intel HDA soundcard, you probably want the following kernel option to improve power-saving:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Sound card support  --->
        <*> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
            [*] PCI sound devices  --->
                <*> Intel HD Audio  --->
                    (2048) Pre-allocated buffer size for HD-audio driver
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
Portage knows the global USE flag ''pulseaudio'' for enabling support for PulseAudio in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|media-sound/pulseaudio}} automatically:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||
USE{{=}}"... pulseaudio ..."
}}
The recommend USE flags of pulseaudio are:
{{USEflag|package=media-sound/pulseaudio
|alsa+yes+yes
|caps+yes+yes
|dbus+yes+yes
|gdbm+yes+yes
|glib+yes+yes
|orc+yes+yes
|udev+yes+yes
}}

Optional USE flags of pulseaudio are:
{{USEflag|package=media-sound/pulseaudio
|X+yes
|asyncns+yes
|avahi
|bluetooth+yes
|doc
|equalizer
|gnome
|gtk+yes
|ipv6+yes
|jack
|libsamplerate++no
|lirc
|oss++no
|realtime
|ssl+yes
|system-wide++no
|systemd
|tcpd+yes
|test
|webrtc-aec+yes
|xen
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

=== Addons ===
* {{Package|media-sound/pavucontrol}} - Pulseaudio Volume Control, a GTK+ based mixer for PulseAudio.
* {{Package|media-sound/paprefs}} - PulseAudio Preferences, a configuration dialog for PulseAudio.
* [[KDE]]'s Phonon integrated PulseAudio configuration and mixing, but it is not as powerful as pavucontrol or paprefs.

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
{{Note|This is the only supported configuration by upstream and Gentoo developers.}}
PulseAudio uses [[udev]] and [[ConsoleKit]] to dynamically give access to the soundcards to the currently "active" user. To make this possible ACLs (Access Control  Lists) are required:
{{Kernel||<pre>
File systems  --->
   Pseudo filesystems  --->
      [*] Virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
      [*]   Tmpfs POSIX Access Control List
</pre>}}

If you're not using a ''desktop'' [[profile]], check that {{Package|sys-auth/consolekit}} is installed with enabled '''acl''' USE flag and that ConsoleKit is running:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/consolekit status|output=<pre>
* status: started
</pre>}}
If not, enable it at boot time:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add consolekit default}}

When you're finished, check, if your permissions are working correctly:
{{Cmd|getfacl /dev/snd/controlC0 {{!}} grep -Eo "user:.+:"  {{!}} cut -d: -f2|output=
YOUR_USERNAME
}}

{{Important|For ConsoleKit managed permissions to be respected '''no one may be part of the ''audio'' group''' (not even even the user pulse). Remove any and all users from the audio group:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -d <user> audio}}
}}

=== Configuring other applications ===
Some applications need to be configured to output to PulseAudio by default. A detailed list of these can be found on the PulseAudio wiki's [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/PerfectSetup PerfectSetup page].

;ALSA
{{Note|If you previous had followed this article, upon upgrade to a fixed version (there should also be an einfo reminder), please remove the ''asound.conf'' file.}}
You need to install {{Package|media-plugins/alsa-plugins}} with ''pulseaudio'' USE flag enabled:
{{Emerge|alsa-plugins}}

;OSS
You need to enable the following module in {{Path|/etc/pulse/default.pa}}:
{{File|/etc/pulse/default.pa||
load-module module-oss
}}

;GStreamer
You need to set serveral GConf keys:
* You can use the graphical tool gstreamer-properties (part of {{Package|media-sound/paprefs}}). Select under '''Audio Input''' and '''Audio Output''' each '''PulseAudio Sound Server'''.
* Manuel with gconftool:
{{Cmd
|gconftool -t string --set /system/gstreamer/0.10/default/audiosink pulsesink
|gconftool -t string --set /system/gstreamer/0.10/default/audiosrc pulsesrc
}}

;ESD
You need to enable the following module in {{Path|/etc/pulse/default.pa}}:
{{File|/etc/pulse/default.pa||
load-module module-protocol-esound-unix
}}
Also you need to select with eselect the PulseAudio implementation:
{{RootCmd|eselect esd set esdcompat}}

;libao
You need to set the following in {{Path|/etc/libao.conf}}:
{{File|/etc/libao.conf||
default_driver{{=}}pulse
}}

;OpenAL
You need to set the following in {{Path|/etc/openal/alsoft.conf}}:
{{File|/etc/openal/alsoft.conf||
drivers {{=}} pulse
}}

;MPlayer
You need to set the following in {{Path|/etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf}}:
{{File|/etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf||
ao{{=}}pulse
}}

=== Without udev ===
{{Warning|Using PA without udev is highly '''not''' recommended. It should be noted that this not only breaks auto-detection but hot-plugging as whole needlessly making your life harder as well as disabling use of ConsoleKit essentially voiding the article. Please, if you have the possibility to use udev (and you most certainly have), just use it.}}

In case that you are using ALSA as a PulseAudio sink (output) and routing ALSA apps to PA but not using udev, you must make sure to have set a specific device to be used. Else, PulseAudio will use ALSA device "default" as sink which may be routed back to PulseAudio, forming a loop. To avoid this, add the parameter ''device=hw:0,0'' (you can find the correct IDs by running ''aplay -l''). In the following example, we use two soundcards, of which card 0, device 0 is used as a sink (audio output, e.g. speakers) and card 1, device 0 as a source (audio input, e.g. microphone). PulseAudio will still be able to access other cards than these but it needs these settings to avoid looping the ''default'' device in this setup.

{{File|/etc/pulse/default.pa|Using a specific ALSA device as PulseAudio sink/source|<pre>
load-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0,0
load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0
</pre>}}
{{Note|If you forget to specify this when using the ALSA sink/source modules, you may not notice any problems until you restart PulseAudio (e.g. by logging out and back in or rebooting). You will be left with (obviously) no audio and a slowed down desktop environment and hanging applications until you resolve the loop, restart alsasound and kill all running pulseaudio processes.}}

=== Headless server ===
These instructions are for setting up a headless pulse audio server. Meaning a server which has no display on it but does have speakers. This provides the ability to use the remote server's speakers for audio output.

You will get warned in a dozen places for doing this, but it is the proper method.

==== Server ====
First configure USE flags and emerge the package. The system-wide USE flag is masked, so we have to unmask it.
{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /etc/portage/profile|echo "-system-wide" >> /etc/portage/profile/use.mask|echo "media-sound/pulseaudio system-wide" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}
{{Emerge|params+=--oneshot|pulseaudio}}

Add the following 2 lines somewhere in the system.pa file
{{File|/etc/pulse/system.pa||<pre>
load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=1.2.3.0/24
load-module module-alsa-sink
</pre>}}
''Replace 1.2.3.0/24 with the network mask that you want to be able to access the server.''
{{Note|If you have multiple ALSA devices, you will need to specify the device to use by adding <u>device</u> or <u>device_id</u> to the module-alsa-sink module}}

Tell the init script that we really do want to do this, and then start it up.
{{RootCmd
|echo "PULSEAUDIO_SHOULD_NOT_GO_SYSTEMWIDE{{=}}1" >> /etc/conf.d/pulseaudio
|rc-update add pulseaudio default|rc-service pulseaudio start
}}

==== Client ====
{{Cmd|pacmd load-module module-tunnel-sink server{{=}}1.2.3.4|output=server (1.2.3.4) is the IP of the server.}}

For a more permanent solution you can add the following to your default.pa file
{{File|/etc/pulse/default.pa||<pre>
load-module module-tunnel-sink server=1.2.3.4
</pre>}}

Now in the pulse audio volume control you should see the remote server listed under <u>Output Devices</u>. Under playback you should have a button next to the ''Mute audio'' button that when clicked will let you switch that audio stream to whichever output you want.

== Troubleshooting ==
* {{Bug|pulseaudio|search=package}}
* {{Bug|PulseAudio|site=fdo|search=product}}

=== Enable debug mode ===
To get more informations you need to set the following in {{Path|/etc/pulse/daemon.conf}}:
{{File|/etc/pulse/daemon.conf||
log-level{{=}}debug
}}
Afterwards restart the daemon:
{{Cmd|pulseaudio -k}}

=== Audio/Video out of sync ===
When using Pulseaudio over your local network, you can experience out-of-sync problems. Solve this by adding '''tsched=0''':

{{File|/etc/pulse/default.pa||<nowiki>
load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0
</nowiki>}}
This disables time scheduling. Afterwards restart the daemon:
{{Cmd|pulseaudio -k}}

=== Dummy Output ===
If the only playback device is the '''Dummy Output''', PulseAudio can not access your sound devices. Either the user has no permissions (see section [[#Permissions|Permissions]] or another program blocks the access. Try:
{{Cmd|fuser -v /dev/snd/*}}
It shows the relevant program. Close the program und reconfigure it to use PulseAudio.

=== Root can play sound, other users cannot ===
Check whether the device nodes have proper permissions:
{{Cmd|ls -l /dev/snd|output=<pre>
crw-rw-rw-+ 1 root audio 116,  6 Apr  9  2013 controlC0
crw-rw-rw-+ 1 root audio 116,  5 Apr  9  2013 hwC0D0
crw-rw-rw-+ 1 root audio 116,  4 Apr  9  2013 pcmC0D0c
crw-rw-rw-+ 1 root audio 116,  3 Apr  9  2013 pcmC0D0p
crw-rw-rw-+ 1 root audio 116, 33 Apr  9  2013 timer
</pre>}}
Should they only have crw-rw---- set, use {{RootCmd|chmod o+rw /dev/snd*}} to correct this. Do not add your user to the audio group. While it would permit access to the device nodes, PulseAudio will no longer be able to manage the audio devices.

=== No guarantees on actual latencies ===
Currently PA provides whatever latency at that moment is possible be it some milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds without regard to what applications ask for.

=== In case of buffer under-run latencies are never decreased ===
Currently, if a buffer under-run occurs, PA buffers for longer increasing latency, but it then never tries to buffer for less until restart.

=== Re-sampling using up a lot of CPU time ===
Re-sampling can require quite a lot of computational power, PA defaults are rather conservative but in certain cases can still take a significant toll, in such cases edit {{Path|/etc/pulse/daemon.conf}} and consider changing ''resample-method'' to something less CPU intensive, ''default-sample-format'' and ''default-sample-rate'' can also affect CPU utilization with higher bit-depth and larger difference in sample-rate generally needing more resources (e.g. re-sampling 44.1 kHz to 48 kHz is faster than re-sampling either to 192 kHz). Since re-sampling is done per each channel per input, channel configuration and number of applications can affect performance as well.

{{Note|Using a version of PA with Orc support can noticeably decrease CPU usage, too. Also PA has the ability, if certain conditions are met, to automatically switch sinks between common sampling rates, this effectively can avoid some re-sampling.}}
