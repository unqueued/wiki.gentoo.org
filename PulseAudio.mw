PulseAudio or PA for short is a sound server that provides a number of features on top of the low-level audio interface (ALSA) on Linux, such as:

* Networking support
* Per-application volume controls
* Better cross-platform support
* Dynamic latency adjustment, which can be used to save power

PulseAudio allows for playing audio applications on the server, while hearing it through the client's soundcard. The application running on the server sends its audio output to the Pulse server instead of the server's soundcard. The Pulse client on the client receives this output and lets Alsa process it to the client's soundcard.

==Setup==

===PA USE flags===

Currently PulseAudio has quite a few USE flags but some of them are more important than others hence only portion of the available USE flags are being explained here.

{{USEflag
|package=media-sound/pulseaudio
|alsa+yes+yes+PA is the top part of an audio stack hence PA itself needs support for some form of audio output, ALSA being the most common for non-professional systems.
|udev+yes+yes+Provides hardware detection, helps greatly if ALSA applications are being routed via PA by default (see [[#Making ALSA-only applications use PA|Making ALSA-only applications use PA]]).
|realtime++yes
|caps+yes+yes+Allows PA to drop unneeded capabilities, increasing security.
|orc+yes+yes+Improves performance of re-sampling (available only starting with PA 1.0).
|X+yes+yes
|libsamplerate++no+Provides exceptionally CPU intensive re-samplers that are generally regarded as not worth it.
|system-wide++no
}}

===Relevant USE flags for other ebuilds===

{{USEflag
|pulseaudio++yes+Please enable this if you want to use PA on your system.
}}

===PA installation===

The recommend way is to set pulseaudio USE flag for desired ebuilds and then run
{{emerge|params=--ask --deep --newuse --update --verbose
|@world
}}

But if need be PA can be manually installed with
{{emerge|params=
|media-sound/pulseaudio
}}

===Making ALSA-only applications use PA===
{{Warning|Starting with {{Package|media-plugins/alsa-plugins-1.0.25-r1}} having it installed with the '''pulseaudio''' USE flag is enough, rest of the section has been left for now because no version with the fix has not yet been stabilized. If you previous had followed this article, upon upgrade to a fixed version (there should also be an einfo reminder), please remove the ''asound.conf'' file.}}
For applications with PA support, no additional setup is required but for ALSA-only applications to be able to benefit from PA, it is highly recommended that {{Package|media-plugins/alsa-plugins}} is installed with '''pulseaudio''' USE flag (should be the case but it does not hurt to check) and ''/etc/asound.conf'' is edited to route them back to PA so that ALSA-only applications, too, can have improved mixing quality and per-application sound controls among other benefits.
{{Warning|It's highly important that udev is being used for hardware detection, else PA itself will be unable to access sound devices without custom configuration!}}

{{file|/etc/asound.conf|Change this file to make PA the default for ALSA applications|<pre>
pcm.!default {
        type pulse
}
ctl.!default {
        type pulse
}
</pre>}}

===Fast user switching===

For fast user switching to work with PA where each session has its own PulseAudio process, ConsoleKit is used to know which session is active and therefore most likely to be the desired one to be granted exclusive control over device files in ''/dev/snd/''. To make this possible Access Control  Lists (or ACL for short) are required and because /dev is usually devfs, which is a form of tmpfs, ACL support for tmpfs is a must.

{{Kernel|Enabling ACL for tmpfs|<pre>
File systems  --->
   Pseudo filesystems  --->
      [*] Virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
      [*]   Tmpfs POSIX Access Control List
</pre>}}

{{Warning|For ConsoleKit managed permissions to be respected '''no one may be part of the ''audio'' group''' (not even even the user pulse). In fact, for users to be able to output sound vai PA they do not have to be part of any specific group.

Also it is recommended that the '''acl''' USE flag is globally enabled (Desktop profiles do this by default).}}

{{Note|For obvious reasons ConsoleKit has to be running for this to work which is usually the case but, if it is not started by default, please enable it. In case of OpenRC, this can be accomplished using
{{RootCmd|rc-update add consolekit default}}
}}

==Usage==

A handy cross-desktop graphical tool is available for setting various aspects of PA. Install it with

{{emerge|params=
|media-sound/pavucontrol
}}

KDE users can to some extent use Phonon`s configuration but it is not a full replacement for pavucontrol.

==Configuring other applications==

Some applications need to be configured to output to PulseAudio by default. A detailed list of these can be found on the PulseAudio wiki's [http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup PerfectSetup page].

==Known problems and limitations==

===No guarantees on actual latencies===
Currently PA provides whatever latency at that moment is possible be it some milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds without regard to what applications ask for.

===In case of buffer under-run latencies are never decreased===
Currently, if a buffer under-run occurs, PA buffers for longer increasing latency, but it then never tries to buffer for less until restart.

===Re-sampling using up a lot of CPU time===
Re-sampling can require quite a lot of computational power, PA defaults are rather conservative but in certain cases can still take a significant toll, in such cases edit ''/etc/pulse/daemon.conf'' and consider changing '''resample-method''' to something less CPU intensive, '''default-sample-format''' and '''default-sample-rate''' can also affect CPU utilization with higher bit-depth and larger difference in sample-rate generally needing more resources (e.g. re-sampling 44.1 kHz to 48 kHz is faster than re-sampling either to 192 kHz). Since re-sampling is done per each channel per input, channel configuration and number of applications can affect performance as well.

{{Note|
Using a version of PA with Orc support can noticeably decrease CPU usage, too.
}}

== Things that really should not be here ==
=== Using PA without udev ===
{{Warning|Using PA without udev is highly '''not''' recommended. It should be noted that this not only breaks auto-detection but hot-plugging as whole needless making your life harder as well as disabling use of ConsoleKit essentially voiding the article. Please, if you have the possibility to use udev, just use it.}}

In case that you are using ALSA as a PulseAudio sink (output) and routing ALSA apps to PA but not using udev, you must make sure to have set a specific device to be used. Else, PulseAudio will use ALSA device "default" as sink which may be routed back to PulseAudio, forming a loop. To avoid this, add the parameter ''device=hw:0,0'' (you can find the correct IDs by running ''aplay -l''). In the following example, we use two soundcards, of which card 0, device 0 is used as a sink (audio output, e.g. speakers) and card 1, device 0 as a source (audio input, e.g. microphone). PulseAudio will still be able to access other cards than these but it needs these settings to avoid looping the ''default'' device in this setup.

{{file|/etc/pulse/default.pa|Using a specific ALSA device as PulseAudio sink/source|<pre>
load-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0,0
load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0
</pre>}}
{{Note|If you forget to specify this when using the ALSA sink/source modules, you may not notice any problems until you restart PulseAudio (e.g. by logging out and back in or rebooting). You will be left with (obviously) no audio and a slowed down desktop environment and hanging applications until you resolve the loop, restart alsasound and kill all running pulseaudio processes.}}
