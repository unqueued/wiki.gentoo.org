|Improve ROOT support|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
[https://root.cern.ch/ ROOT] is a modular scientific software framework, a standard de-facto analysis tool in HEP, but used in other scientific and industrial areas too. We support ROOT in Gentoo and have a long list of improvements awaiting implementation:
* move ROOT from configure to cmake;
* add new USE flags and dependencies;
* move documentation generation from THtml to doxygen;
* improve PyROOT:
** dependency cleanup (split ROOT.py and put Pythonize.cxx in its own .so);
** make the core of PyROOT standalone, so that it as "PyCling" when it's packaged with Cling and libCore/libCling can be used standalone;
** get clingcwrapper.cxx from PyPy into ROOT as a standalone .so, so that PyROOT can run on PyPy w/o further ado;
* make Cling installable as a separate package.
