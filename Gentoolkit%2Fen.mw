Gentoolkit is a suite of tools to ease the administration of a Gentoo system. This document covers the basics of some of the tools present in Gentoolkit.

== Introduction ==

=== What is Gentoolkit? ===

Gentoo is a unique distribution and presents some complexities that simply do not exist for other distributions. As Gentoo developers and contributors discovered some of these complexities, they also wrote tools to help users and administrators work around them. Many tools have been contributed to the Gentoo project and are included in the {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} package. 

{{Note|As of now, there are two versions of Gentoolkit: {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} and {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit-dev}}. While the former contains administration scripts, the latter contains scripts specific to help ''development'' on Gentoo. Gentoo developers can have their scripts included into {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit-dev}} by contacting the Gentoolkit maintainer. The remainder of this document discusses the {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} package only.}}

Gentoolkit contains a whole bunch of useful tools to help users manage packages and keep track of what is going on in their systems. Most users - particularly those who update systems often - will benefit from having Gentoolkit installed.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

As with most other Gentoo packages, installation is as simple as an {{c|emerge}}: 

{{Emerge|app-portage/gentoolkit}}

{{Note|Many of the tools in Gentoolkit reveal important information about the system they are installed on or require root privileges. For that reason, some of the programs may only be executed (or only function properly) if run by a user with root privileges.}}

=== Finding documentation ===

Any documentation that a program might have (other than man pages) is stored in {{Path|/usr/share/doc/gentoolkit-[version]/[program-name]/}}.

== euse ==

{{c|euse}} is a tool to see, set and unset USE flags at various places. For more information on USE flags, please refer to the [[Handbook:X86/Working/USE|USE Flags]]. See {{c|euse -h}} for complete help and all options.

=== Viewing, setting, and unsetting USE flags ===

The {{c|euse -a}} command reads the current active USE flags and displays them. 

{{Note|There are 5 "columns" that {{c|euse}} now uses to show whether a flag is set/unset and where all the flag has been set. The columns are as follows -- +/-, set in the '''E'''nvironment, set in {{Path|make.'''C'''onf}}, set in {{Path|make.'''D'''efaults}}, and set in {{Path|make.'''G'''lobals}}. The output looks like [+ECDG].}}

Similarly the {{c|euse -a -g}} command is used to view ''active'' global USE flags. The {{c|euse -a -l}} command does the same for active local USE flags. <code>-g</code> and <code>-l</code> are sub-options to {{c|euse}} and need an option before them (like <code>-a</code>) to function correctly. 

{{RootCmd|euse -a -l|output=<pre>
bitmap-fonts        [+  D ]
font-server         [+  D ]
fortran             [+  D ]

offensive           [+    ]
truetype            [+ CD ]
</pre>
}}

<tt>euse</tt> is able to set or unset USE flags. The commands used for this are <tt>euse -E flagname</tt> (enable a flag) and <tt>euse -D flagname</tt> (disable a flag). 

{{Warning|Do not use the {{c|euse -E}} or {{c|euse -D}} commands by themselves (without a flag). '''It will set/unset ALL USE flags''' in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. Although a backup is kept at {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf.euse_backup}}, please be careful while using {{c|euse -E}} or {{c|euse -D}}!}}

Enabling a USE flag:

{{RootCmd|euse -E 3dfx|output=<pre>
/etc/portage/make.conf was modified, a backup copy has been placed at /etc/portage/make.conf.euse_backup
</pre>}}

The {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} file looks like so after the command was ran:

{{FileBox|filename=make.conf|title=After enabling the 3dfx USE flag|lang=bash|1=
USE="alsa acpi apache2 -arts cups cdr crypt cscope -doc fbcon \
     firefox gd gif gimpprint gnome gpm gstreamer gtkhtml imlib \
     innodb -java javascript jpeg libg++ libwww mad mbox md5sum \
     mikmod mmx motif mpeg mpeg4 mysql ncurses nvidia \
     ogg odbc offensive opengl pam pdflib perl png python \
     quicktime readline sdl spell sse ssl svga tcltk tiff truetype usb \
     vanilla X xosd xv xvid x86 zlib 3dfx"
}}

Disabling a USE flag:

{{RootCmd|euse -D 3dfx|output=<pre>
/etc/portage/make.conf was modified, a backup copy has been placed at /etc/portage/make.conf.euse_backup
</pre>}}

Again, the {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} file after the command:

{{FileBox|filename=make.conf|title=After disabling the 3dfx USE flag|lang=bash|1=
USE="alsa acpi apache2 -arts cups cdr crypt cscope -doc fbcon \
     firefox gd gif gimpprint gnome gpm gstreamer gtkhtml imlib \
     innodb -java javascript jpeg libg++ libwww mad mbox md5sum \
     mikmod mmx motif mpeg mpeg4 mysql ncurses nvidia \
     ogg odbc offensive opengl pam pdflib perl png python \
     quicktime readline sdl spell sse ssl svga tcltk tiff truetype usb \
     vanilla X xosd xv xvid x86 zlib -3dfx"
}}

{{Note|{{c|euse}} does not physically remove the flag from {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. It adds a <code>-</code> (minus) before the flag to unset it. A manual clean up of the {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} might be needed to avoid unwanted variables. Otherwise use the <code>-P</code> (purge) option to remove the flag. {{c|euse -P 3dfx}} for example would remove the <code>3dfx</code> flag.}}

== Other tools ==

=== revdep-rebuild ===

This tool is Gentoo's Reverse Dependency rebuilder. It will scan the installed ebuilds to find packages that have become broken as a result of an upgrade of a package they depend on. It can emerge those packages for users automatically but it can also happen that a given package does not work with the currently installed dependencies, in which case you should upgrade the broken package to a more recent version. {{c|revdep-rebuild}} will pass flags to {{c|emerge}} which lets you use the <code>--pretend</code> flag to see what is going to be emerged again before going any further. 

{{RootCmd|revdep-rebuild -p|output=<pre>

}}

To rebuild some packages run {{c|revdep-rebuild}} without the <code>-p</code> flag and the listed packages will be emerged again. 

=== glsa-check ===

<tt>[https://www.gentoo.org/support/security/ glsa-check]</tt> is mainly a test tool that keeps track of the various [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/ GLSA's] (Gentoo Linux Security Advisory) and will eventually be integrated into {{c|emerge}} and {{c|equery}}.

=== eread ===

{{c|eread}} is a simple utility to display elog files produced by >=<code>portage-2.1</code>. The saving of elog files can be enabled by setting a couple of variables in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}: 

{{FileBox|filename=make.conf|title=Enabling elog|lang=bash|1=
PORTAGE_ELOG_CLASSES="log"
PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="save"
}}

{{Note|This is only one way of saving elog messages. For more information on how Portage's elog system works, please refer to the appropriate page in the [[Handbook:X86/Portage/Files#Logging_features|Portage Handbook]].}}

Once elog has been set up to satisfaction, run <tt>eread</tt> to view the log files. 

{{Cmd|eread|output=<pre>
This is a list of portage log items. Choose a number to view that file or type
q to quit.
  
1) app-portage:gentoolkit-0.2.4_pre2:20070320-000256.log
2) app-portage:gentoolkit-0.2.4_pre2:20070320-000258.log
3) app-portage:gentoolkit-0.2.4_pre2:20070320-000319.log
4) app-portage:gentoolkit-0.2.3:20070320-000408.log
Choice?
</pre>
}}

Select a number and the file will be displayed using the paging program specified in the <var>PAGER</var> environment variable. If <var>PAGER</var> is not set, it will use {{c|less}}. The <var>PAGER</var> environmental variable can be set using {{c|eselect}} (module <code>pager</code>).

After displaying the elog item, you will be prompted if you want to delete the file.

=== eclean ===

{{c|eclean}} is a tool to remove old source files and old binary packages from the system. 

When building and installing packages, the source files are downloaded and preserved in <var>DISTDIR</var>, usually {{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles}}. This can accumulate several gigabytes of material over time if it is not cleaned periodically. Users should run {{c|eclean-dist}} to clean source files from <var>DISTDIR</var>.

It is possible to create archives of installed packages by using {{c|quickpkg}} or <code>FEATURES="buildpkg"</code>. These archived packages are kept in <var>PKGDIR</var>, usually {{Path|/usr/portage/packages}}. When they are no longer needed, or if they are too old, {{c|eclean-pkg}} can be ran to remove them from <var>PKGDIR</var>. It is a good way to ensure that any binary packages on the system are only the latest versions. 

For more information on {{c|eclean}} and tips on maintaining a cruft-free system, please read {{c|man eclean}} or check the [[eclean]] article.
