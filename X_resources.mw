== Introduction ==
X resources are configuration options for X applications such as rxvt-unicode. They can also be used for setting the cursor theme. X resources can be set in {{Path|~/.Xresources}}. Most display managers automatically load this configuration file on startup.

== Syntax ==

Configuration options in the {{Path|~/.Xresources}} file should respect the following syntax:
* <code>''name''.''resource'': ''value''</code> (for example <code>Xcursor.theme: redglass</code>)

Constants can be defined in the following way:
* <code>#define ''name'' ''value''</code> (for example <code>#define black #000000</code>)

Comments start with an exclamation mark.
