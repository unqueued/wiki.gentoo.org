Also known as the {{Path|~/.Xresources}} file.

== Introduction ==

X resources are configuration options for X applications such as the [[rxvt-unicode]] terminal emulator. They can also be used for setting the [[Cursor themes|cursor theme]]. X resources can be set in {{Path|~/.Xresources}}.

While most display managers will automatically load this configuration file on startup, it is possible to load the configuration manually by running:
{{Cmd|xrdb ~/.Xresources}}

The {{c|xrdb}} command is provided by the {{Package|x11-apps/xrdb}} package.

== Syntax ==

Configuration options in the {{Path|~/.Xresources}} file should respect the following component syntax:

<code>''name''.''Class''.''resource'': ''value''</code>

{{Note|In many options the ''Class'' component is not used.}}

Examples of existing configuration options:
* <code>Xcursor.theme: redglass</code>
* <code>xscreensaver.Dialog.background: #111111</code>

=== Comments ===
Comments start with an exclamation mark. For example:

<code>! This is a comment</code>

=== Wildcards ===
It is possible to use <code>?</code> and <code>*</code> wildcards to apply a single rule to multiple configuration options. The <code>?</code> matches any single component. The <code>*</code> matches zero or more components. For example:

<code>*background: #000000</code> - Set the given value to all programs/classes which contain a component named ''background''.

=== Constants ===
Constants can be defined in the following way:

<code>#define ''name'' ''value''</code> (for example <code>#define black #000000</code>).

=== Includes ===
The main {{Path|~/.Xresources}} file can be composed of multiple sub-files (e.g. on a per-application basis). The includes can be defined as:

<code>#include "''file_name''"</code>

Example of including application sub-files:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|1=#include ".Xresources.d/urxvt"
#include ".Xresources.d/xft"}}
