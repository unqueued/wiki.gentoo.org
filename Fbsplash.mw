fbsplash is a Gentoo implementation of a Bootsplash screen to provide some eye candy during boot up or while working on a terminal without X. It is currently available in portage as {{Package|media-gfx/splashutils}}.

== Installation ==
You can install {{Package|media-gfx/splashutils}} with the following command:
{{Emerge|media-gfx/splashutils}}
To also install the Gentoo themes which are also used on the Live CD/DVD:
{{Emerge|media-gfx/splash-themes-gentoo}}
And more themes with:
{{Emerge|media-gfx/bootsplash-themes}}

=== USE Flags ===
{{USEflag|package=media-gfx/splashutils
|hardened++no+
|png+yes+yes+
|truetype+yes+yes+
|mng+yes+yes+
|gpm
|fbcondecor
}}

=== Requirements ===
To use a splash image the kernel needs to support [[initramfs]].

==== Kernel ====
Enable framebuffer console decorations:
{{Kernel|Kernel framebuffer configuration|<pre>
Device Drivers ->
    Graphics support ->
        <*> Support for frame buffer devices  --->
            Console display driver support  --->
                <*> Framebuffer Console support
                [ ] Enable Tile Blitting Support
                [*] Support for the Framebuffer Console Decorations</pre>}}
Enable Keyboard support for framebuffer themes:
{{Kernel|Enabling the Event Interface|<pre>
Device Drivers --->
    Input Device Support --->
        <*> Event Interface</pre>}}

Using either [[radeon]], [[intel]] or [[nouveau]] drivers provides a framebuffer capable device which is well implemented into the operating system. For users with the binary nVidia or AMD driver, there are workarounds using [[uvesafb]] to get frambuffer support.

== Usage ==
General usage screnarios

=== Themes ===
The different themes are stored in {{Path|/etc/splash}} where the folder represents the theme name. To test some of them on the console use:
{{RootCmd|splash_manager <nowiki>-c set --theme=livecd-2007.0 --tty=1</nowiki>}}
This will change the theme on ''tty1'' to ''livecd-2007.0''. You can choose any theme in {{Path|/etc/splash}} that matches your current resolution. Now to see the theme go to tty1 by pressing {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|F1}}.
If you want to preview a theme in silent mode without reboot, then try
{{RootCmd|splash_manager <nowiki>-c demo -t livecd-2007.0 -m s --steps=100</nowiki>}}
{{Note|don't run this command under X window}}
For more reference please refer to
{{RootCmd|<nowiki>splash_manager --help</nowiki>}}

=== Genkernel ===
If you already use [[genkernel]] to generate your initramfs, then just change the configuration in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} to the theme you want to use. This is especially the case if you use any other compression method than gzip. Please see also [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/de/genkernel.xml Gentoo Linux Genkernel Guide]

=== Append ===
To append the theme to an existing initramfs:
{{RootCmd|splash_geninitramfs --verbose --res NxN --append /path/to/initramfsimage theme}}

=== Generate ===
To create a new initramfs for our theme:
{{RootCmd|splash_geninitramfs --verbose --res NxN --generate /boot/initramfs-bootsplash theme}}

=== Copy ===
To create a new initramfs with the content of an existing one to add our theme:
{{RootCmd|splash_geninitramfs --verbose --res NxN --copy /path/to/initramfsdir theme}}

=== Bootloader ===
In [[GRUB2]] the parameters can be added to the variable GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in {{Path|/etc/defaults/grub}}. For GRUB or other bootloaders check their manual pages on how to append to the kernel commandline. Example:
{{Code|Kernel parameters|<nowiki>splash=verbose,theme:natural_gentoo</nowiki>}}
This enables the ''verbose'' version of the ''natural_gentoo'' theme, a full list of parameters can be found in {{Path|/usr/share/doc/splashutils*/kernel_parameters}}
