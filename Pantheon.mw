Pantheon is a new lightweight, modular desktop environment primarily written in Vala and GTK+, for the [http://elementaryos.org/ elementary OS] project.

== Installation ==

Pantheon currently resides in the elementary overlay. You will first need to ensure you have [[layman]] installed. Then you will need to add the elementary overlay.

{{RootCmd|layman -a elementary}}

Next, we need to add the ~arch keyword to allow installation. At the time of writing only ~amd64 is supported. After keywording pantheon-base/pantheon, portage will give instructions for all dependent packages that also require a keyword. A list of required keyword changes is supplied below.
{{File|/etc/portage/package.keywords/pantheon.keywords||<pre>
pantheon-base/pantheon ~amd64

mail-client/postler ~amd64
pantheon-base/pantheon-shell ~amd64
gnome-base/gnome-desktop ~amd64
x11-themes/elementary-icon-theme ~amd64
x11-themes/elementary-theme ~amd64
x11-libs/granite ~amd64
dev-libs/folks ~amd64
pantheon-base/marlin ~amd64
dev-util/euclide ~amd64
media-sound/beatbox ~amd64
app-office/dexter ~amd64
net-libs/gnome-online-accounts ~amd64
app-editors/scratch ~amd64
pantheon-base/switchboard ~amd64
x11-terms/pantheon-terminal ~amd64
app-office/maya ~amd64
dev-db/sqlheavy ~amd64
</pre>}}

You should ensure that X is included in your global [[USE flag|USE flags]]. Beyond that, I've added a list of other necessary USE flags to install pantheon.

{{File|/etc/portage/package.use/pantheon.use||<pre>
sys-fs/udev gudev
sys-auth/consolekit policykit
sys-auth/pambase consolekit
dev-libs/libxml2 python
</pre>}}

There were also a few packages that were hard-masked in portage. These will need to be unmasked for now:

{{File|/etc/portage/package.mask/pantheon.mask||<pre>
=media-libs/cogl-1.10.4
=media-libs/clutter-1.10.8
</pre>}}

Next, I encountered a blocking package between vte and gtk+. I started by emerging gtk+ first:

{{Emerge|params=--oneshot --ask --verbose|
x11-libs/gtk+}}
