'''Pantheon''' is [[Article description::a new lightweight, modular desktop environment primarily written in Vala and GTK+.]] It was originally written for use with Elementary OS, but is in the process of being ported to Gentoo.

== Prerequisites ==

Users should be aware ''elementary'' [[ebuild repository]] is undergoing rapid development the following instructions are subject to significant changes.

Pantheon currently resides in the elementary ebuild repository. There are two primary methods for installing repositories in Gentoo:

# The older {{c|layman}} method. {{c|layman}} must be installed when going this route. Proceed to the {{c|[[layman]]}} article to install layman, then return and move on the to the [[#Layman|next step]].
# The newer {{Path|repos.conf}} method. A special {{Path|elementary.conf}} file must be created in {{Path|repos.conf}}, then the repository must be synced using one of the many methods available. Pay a visit to the {{Path|[[repos.conf]]}} article for more information on how to use this method, then see the [[#repos.conf|associated section]] below.

=== Layman ===

When {{c|layman}} is ready to go add the ''elementary'' repository:

{{RootCmd|layman -a elementary}}

=== repos.conf ===

Create a file in the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf|/etc/portage/repos.conf]]}} directory (create the {{Path|repos.conf}} directory first if it does not exist) called {{Path|elementary.conf}}. Fill the file's contents with the following code:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/repos.conf/elementary.conf|lang=ini|1=
[elementary]
location = /usr/local/overlay/elementary
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/pimvullers/elementary.git
auto-sync = yes
masters = gentoo
}}

=== Profile ===

Setting a GNOME desktop profile for the system will help prepare the base system for pantheon to be installed:

==== OpenRC ====

When using OpenRC, select:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome}}

==== systemd ====

systemd users will need to GNOME profile with systemd on the end:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd}}

=== Keywording ===

Those who have a separate (virtual) machine for testing Elementary CAN add the ~arch (unstable) keyword in order to allow the installation of the latest (and greatest) Elementary package atoms. For now, only the {{Keyword|~amd64}} and {{Keyword|~x86}} keywords are supported (although in the future and with more testing other architectures may be supported).

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"
}}

This is the 'quick and easy' method for installing Elementary.

If an unstable global keyword was added the following {{Path|package.accept_keywords}} section can be skipped.

=== package.accept_keywords ===

For those who want try Elementary alongside other desktop environments, it is wise to provide Portage with only the explicit instructions Elementary needs for (dependent) packages that require keywording. Copy the following list in the {{Path|package.accept_keywords}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|1=

}}

=== package.use ===

Ensure that <code>X</code> USE flag is included in the system's global [[USE flag]]s. 

==== OpenRC ====

Other necessary USE flags to install pantheon for the OpenRC init system are as follows:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|1=
sys-fs/udev gudev
sys-auth/consolekit policykit
sys-auth/pambase consolekit
dev-libs/libxml2 python
x11-libs/gdk-pixbuf jpeg
}}

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

The pantheon meta-package pulls in the necessary packages. This can be done by emerging just the {{Package|pantheon-base/pantheon-shell}} meta package and then select the desired elementary applications:

{{Emerge|pantheon-base/pantheon-shell}}

Then, for example, emerge Audience and Pantheon terminal:

{{Emerge|media-video/audience x11-terms/pantheon-terminal}}

== Removal ==

=== Unmerge ===

{{Unmerge|pantheon-base/pantheon-shell}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Reporting issues ===

As mentioned in the beginning, the elementary repository is undergoing rapid development, just like the upstream elementary OS project. This means that things might break, or do not work properly yet. If you discover any issues, or if you want to contribute, just create a [https://github.com/pimvullers/elementary/issues/new new issue] on the [https://github.com/pimvullers/elementary elementary ebuild repository] Github project or contact the [mailto:elementary@vullersmail.nl maintainer].
