Pantheon is a new lightweight, modular desktop environment primarily written in Vala and GTK+, for the [http://elementaryos.org/ elementary OS] project.

== Installation ==

Pantheon currently resides in the elementary overlay. You will first need to ensure you have [[layman]] installed. Then you will need to add the elementary overlay.

{{RootCmd|layman -a elementary}}

Next, we need to add the ~arch keyword to allow installation. At the time of writing only ~amd64 is supported. After keywording pantheon-base/pantheon, portage will give instructions for all dependent packages that also require a keyword. A list of required keyword changes is supplied below.
{{File|/etc/portage/package.keywords/pantheon.keywords||<pre>
pantheon-base/pantheon ~amd64

mail-client/postler ~amd64
pantheon-base/pantheon-shell ~amd64
gnome-base/gnome-desktop ~amd64

You must also ensure that the following use flags are in place, if they aren't already included in your global [[USE flag|USE flags]].
