On [[GTK+]] based applications, the key sequence for hexadecimal Unicode input is {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|Shift}}+{{Key|u}}+<code><hex digit></code>.  As an example, the unicode character ✔ which has unicode number [http://unicode-table.com/en/2714/ U+2714] can be written as {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|Shift}}+{{Key|u}}+<code>2714</code>+<code>ENTER</CODE>, being rendered as <code>&#x2714;</code>.
