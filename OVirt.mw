== Background ==
 oVirt project is a complete open sourced virtualization management platform working with kvm.
 More can be found here: http://www.ovirt.org/
 Additional information (including presentations) from a Workshop held early this November is
 available here: http://www.ovirt.org/wiki/Workshop_November_2011

 The Project is made of an Engine core, which is the backend server.
 Every hypervisor should have a VDSM agent installed, which is the agent the core will use to manage that host.
 Additionally there's a client side which is UI (GWT based) and/or RESTful API.

== Description ==
 This article will try to explain how to install oVirt on Gentoo system using instructions from ovirt.org.
== Important ==
 This manual is what I did on my Gentoo server. If you have different install, which you probably do, you might not strictly do copy/paste and some additional steps might be necessary!!!
== Install procedure ==
=== Step 1: vdsm ===
emerge dev-python/pyflakes (needed by vdsm)<b>
Install vdsm<b>
Get srpm 
wget -c http://fsimonce.fedorapeople.org/vdsm/fedora-16/SRPMS/vdsm-4.9.0-0.200.g2fc4e63.fc16.src.rpm
Turn it to tgz
 rpm2tgz vdsm-4.9.0-0.200.g2fc4e63.fc16.src.rpm
Unpack
 tar zxvf vdsm-4.9.0-0.200.g2fc4e63.fc16.src.tgz

and install it from source code.

=== Step 2: JDK ===
- Sun JDK >=1.6.0.24 should work well
 <nowiki>
$> emerge sun-jdk</nowiki>

=== Step 3: J2EE server- JBoss ===
* For now, simply put JBoss' upstream server binaries.
* TODO: create a wrapping ebuild.
* TODO2: (for the bold): try compiling JBoss from source and create the ultimate ebuild ;)

 <nowiki>
$> wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/JBoss/JBoss-5.1.0.GA/jboss-5.1.0.GA-jdk6.zip/download
$> unzip jboss-5.1.0.GA-jdk6.zip
$> mv jboss-5.1.0.GA /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA</nowiki>

* Folder should be owned by the developer user, so you'll be able to deploy build products into JBoss.
* Test that JBoss is working
** Run /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin/run.sh

* Troubleshooting... when you're being attacked by exceptions, follow this list;
** Verify folder owner....
** Used TCP ports: 8080/8443/8083/1090/4457/...
*** May be used by other applications. Either close other application or change JBoss configuration<BR> (check /usr/local/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/deploy/jbossweb.sar/server.xml)
** Since JBoss binds to the hostname, your hostname should be resolvable, or you may add it to /etc/hosts for local resolution.
 <nowiki>
127.0.0.1       localhost engine-dev</nowiki>

=== Step 4: build tools ===
* Maven
* git

=== Step 5: DB ===

TODO: postgresql installation

=== Step 6: building from source ===
TBD.

=== Step 7: Testing current setup ===
TBD.

=== Step 8: how to contribute ===

TODO: explain oVirt Gerrit
