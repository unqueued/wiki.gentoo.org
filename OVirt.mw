== Background ==
 oVirt project is a complete open sourced virtualization management platform working with kvm.
 More can be found here: http://www.ovirt.org/
 Additional information (including presentations) from a Workshop held early this November is
 available here: http://www.ovirt.org/wiki/Workshop_November_2011

 The Project is made of an Engine core, which is the backend server.
 Every hypervisor should have a VDSM agent installed, which is the agent the core will use to manage that host.
 Additionally there's a client side which is UI (GWT based) and/or RESTful API.

 This article will try to explain how to install oVirt on Gentoo system using instructions from ovirt.org.
