I had a heck of a time figuring out how to get the touchpad working among other things so I will leave some kernel config hints here! I used gentoo-sources-4.10.9

{{KernelBox|title=touchpad and touchscreen|
Device Drivers --->
 Input device support --->
  [*] Mice --->
   <*> ELAN I2C Touchpad support
    [*] Enable I2C support
    [*] Enable SMbus support
  [*] Touchscreens --->
   <*> USB Touchscreen Driver
    [*] (I just selected everything here)
 
 I2C support --->
  [*] I2C support
  I2C Hardware Bus support --->
   <*> (I selected all Intel options)
   <*> Synopsys DesignWare Platform
   <*> Synopsys DesignWare PCI
   [*] Intel Baytrail I2C semaphore support
}}

And for X, I put this in make.conf:
<pre>INPUT_DEVICES="libinput"</pre>

Now I have both touchscreen and touchpad working!
