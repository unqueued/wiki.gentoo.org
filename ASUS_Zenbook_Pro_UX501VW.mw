== Configuration ==

=== Xorg ===

For proper input, video, and high DPI support on the 3840x2160 screen:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
INPUT_DEVICES="libinput"
VIDEO_CARDS="intel i965 nouveau"
}}

Create a xorg configuration file to set the monitor size in millimeters (these values were quickly and crudely calculated; you may want to measure your own):

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-hidpi.conf|1=
Section "Monitor"
	Identifier	"<default monitor>"
	DisplaySize	342 193
EndSection
}}

If not using GNOME or some other software which manages Xresources and DPI for you, you will need do specify the DPI:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.Xresources|1=
Xft.dpi: 240
}}

And you will need this line in someplace like {{c|~/.xinitrc}} or {{c|~/.xsession}} (depending on your configuration) in order to apply the Xresources file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|1=
xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
}}

Other applications may handle high DPI weirdly. The [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI Arch wiki page on High DPI] has many helpful hints.
