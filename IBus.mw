'''IBus''' ('''I'''ntelligent Input '''Bus''') is [[Article description::an open source input framework for Linux and Unix]].

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-i18n/ibus}}

=== Emerge ===

Except for the basic IBus framework, one or more engines should be installed. For example:

{{emerge| app-i18n/ibus ibus-pinyin}}

=== KDE ===

For IBus to work with [[Qt]] 5 / [[KDE]] 5 / Plasma, the <tt>ibus</tt> USE flag needs to be set on at least {{package|dev-qt/qtgui}} and {{package|kde-plasma/plasma-desktop}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/ibus|lang=bash|1=
dev-qt/qtgui ibus
kde-plasma/plasma-desktop ibus
}}

And those packages rebuilt to reflect that change:

{{emerge| emerge --ask --newuse dev-qt/qtgui kde-plasma/plasma-desktop}}

== Configuration ==

Have a look at the [[eix]] output for more available engines:

{{cmd|eix -c -S engine app-i18n/ibus}}

For graphical toolkit integration, {{package|app-i18n/ibus}} offers <code>gtk</code> (this refers to gtk+:2) and <code>gtk3</code> flags.

The {{package|app-i18n/im-chooser}} package can helpful for selecting the preferred input method. As of now all im-chooser packages in the Portage tree are marked unstable.

If nothing starts (no ibus daemon) when a user logs in, put the following in the {{Path|~/.xprofile}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xprofile|lang=bash|1=
export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
ibus-daemon -drx
}}

The installation can be finely tuned by running:
 
{{cmd|ibus-setup}}

<tt>ibus-setup</tt> can be used to set the preferred input methods, the system keyboard, or to add an icon in the taskbar.

You may also use the command-line <tt>ibus</tt> utility, if you can't or don't want to use <tt>ibus-setup</tt>:
{{cmd|ibus list-engine|ibus engine m17n:t:unicode      # For example}}

To inform Qt ibus is now the input method, run:

{{Cmd|qtconfig}}
