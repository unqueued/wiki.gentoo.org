'''IBus''' (Intelligent Input Bus) is an open source input framework for Linux and Unix.

== Installation ==
Except for the basic IBus framework, one or more engines should be installed. For example:
{{emerge|ibus ibus-pinyin}}
Have a look at the [[eix]] output for more available engines:
{{cmd|eix -c ibus -I app-i18n}}

For graphical toolkit integration, {{package|app-i18n/ibus}} offers gtk (this refers to gtk+:2) and gtk3 useflags, and there is a separate {{package|app-i18n/ibus-qt}} package for [[Qt]] (including [[KDE]]) as well.

You can use {{package|app-i18n/im-chooser}} for selecting your preferred input method.
