'''IBus''' ('''I'''ntelligent Input '''Bus''') is an open source input framework for Linux and Unix.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-i18n/ibus|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|app-i18n/ibus}}:
|X+yes
|deprecated
|gconf
|gtk+yes
|gtk3+yes
|introspection+yes
|nls+yes
|python+yes
|vala
|wayland
}}

=== Emerge ===

Except for the basic IBus framework, one or more engines should be installed. For example:

{{emerge| app-i18n/ibus ibus-pinyin}}

== Configuration ==

Have a look at the [[eix]] output for more available engines:

{{cmd|eix -c ibus -I app-i18n}}

For graphical toolkit integration, {{package|app-i18n/ibus}} offers <code>gtk</code> (this refers to gtk+:2) and <code>gtk3</code> flags. There is a separate {{package|app-i18n/ibus-qt}} package for [[Qt]] (including [[KDE]]) as well. Do not forget to install this latest package if KDE/QT is the main desktop environment for the system.

The {{package|app-i18n/im-chooser}} package can helpful for selecting the preferred input method. As of now all im-chooser packages in the Portage tree are marked unstable.

If nothing starts (no ibus daemon) when a user logs in, put the following in the {{Path|~/.xprofile}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xprofile|lang=bash|1=
export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
ibus-daemon -drx
}}

The installation can be finely tuned by running:
 
{{cmd|ibus-setup}}

<tt>ibus-setup</tt> can be used to set the preferred input methods, the system keyboard, or to add an icon in the taskbar.

You may also use the command-line <tt>ibus</tt> utility, if you can't or don't want to use <tt>ibus-setup</tt>:
{{cmd|ibus list-engine|ibus engine m17n:t:unicode      # For example}}

To inform Qt ibus is now the input method, run:

{{Cmd|qtconfig}}
