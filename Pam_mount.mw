The {{Path|pam_mount.so}} PAM module allows systems to automatically mount file systems when a user logs on, and unmount file systems when the user logs off.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

The {{Package|sys-auth/pam_mount}} package has a few USE flags that it supports:

{{USEflag|package=sys-auth/pam_mount}}

=== Emerge ===

To install the package, just emerge it:

{{Emerge|sys-auth/pam_mount}}

== Configuration ==

No specific configuration is needed for the installation itself. The actual configuration entries are mentioned below under the [[#Usage|Usage]] section.

== Usage ==

=== Mounting regular file systems ===

Edit the PAM configuration file in which the mount action has to be configured. Add the required call to {{Path|pam_mount.so}} for <code>auth</code> and <code>session</code> as shown in the next example:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/pam.d/system-login|title="Enable pam_mount in the proper service"|1=
auth		required	pam_tally2.so onerr=succeed
auth		required	pam_shells.so 
auth		required	pam_nologin.so 
auth		include		system-auth
auth		optional	pam_mount.so

account		required	pam_access.so 
account		required	pam_nologin.so 
account		include		system-auth
account		required	pam_tally2.so onerr=succeed

password	include		system-auth

session         optional        pam_loginuid.so
session		required	pam_env.so 
session		optional	pam_lastlog.so silent 
session		include		system-auth
session		optional	pam_ck_connector.so nox11
session		optional	pam_motd.so motd=/etc/motd
session		optional	pam_mail.so
session		optional	pam_mount.so
}}

Next, edit or create the following configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml|title="Configure pam_mount"|lang=xml|1=
<pam_mount>
  <volume user="your username" fstype="ext4" path="/dev/sdxn" mountpoint="/somewhere" option="fsck" />
  <debug enable="1" />
</pam_mount>
}}

This file will establish the file systems to mount when a particular user logs on. Of course, replace the example values with actual ones.

=== Mounting encrypted file systems (dm-crypt/LUKS) ===

One might want to mount devices encrypted with cryptsetup. At the moment it's managed by {{c|pam_mount}} automatically. You just need to state <code>fstype="crypt"</code> in configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml|lang=xml|1=
<pam_mount>
  <volume user="username" fstype="crypt" path="/dev/sdXN" mountpoint="/somewhere" option="fsck" />
  <debug enable="1" />
</pam_mount>
}}

For other kind of encrypted file systems you may specify your customization for mount programs.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml|lang=xml|1=
<cryptmount>mount.crypt ...</cryptmount>
<cryptumount>umount.crypt %(MNTPT)</cryptumount>
}}

See {{c|man pam_mount.conf}} for details.

=== Unmerge ===

Before removing the package, make sure that no PAM configuration file refers to the module anymore:

{{Cmd|grep pam_mount /etc/pam.d/*}}

If no file refers to it anymore, then the package is safe to unmerge:

{{Unmerge|sys-auth/pam_mount}}
