Git '''L'''arge '''F'''ile '''S'''torage (LFS) is [[Article description::an open source plugin created by GitHub that enables the {{c|[[git]]}} version control system to better track binary blobs.]] It does so by creating a text-based reference to the blob, then tracking and storing the blob in a location external to the git repository itself; typically on a content server.
