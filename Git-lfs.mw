Git '''L'''arge '''F'''ile '''S'''torage (LFS) is an open source plugin by GitHub for the {{c|[[git]]}} version control system. It enables git to better track binary blobs by creating a text-based reference to the blob, then storing the blob external to the git repository itself; typically on a content server.

== Usage ==

Binary files must be tracked by file extension. This enables git LFS to make proper distinctions between binary and non-binary files.

GitHub has released a video on YouTube explaining how to utilize git LFS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLR1RNqJ1Mw
