'''eselect''' is a tool for administration and configuration on Gentoo systems. It ''will'' modify the system’s behavior and should be used with care by the system administrator. eselect is a modular framework for writing configuration utilities. It consists of:

* A main program called {{c|eselect}}.
* Various modules ({{Path|.eselect}} files) which carry out different tasks.
* Several libraries which help ensure consistent behavior and simplify the creation of new modules.

A module provides several actions. Actions typically either display some information ({{c|list}} and {{c|show}} actions are common) or update the system somehow (for example, {{c|set}} and {{c|update}}). Each module also provides {{c|help}} and {{c|usage}} actions which explain how to use the module.
