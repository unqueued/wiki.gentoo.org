'''{{c|eselect}}''' is a tool for administration and configuration on Gentoo systems. It ''will'' modify the system's behavior and should be used with care by the system administrator. The associated modular framework for writing configuration utilities consists of:

* A main program called {{c|eselect}}.
* Various modules ({{Path|.eselect}} files) that carry out different tasks.
* Several libraries which help to ensure consistent behavior and simplify the creation of new modules.

Each module provides several actions. Actions typically either display some information ({{c|list}} and {{c|show}} actions are common) or update the system somehow (for example, {{c|set}} and {{c|update}}). Each module also provides {{c|help}} and {{c|usage}} actions that explain how to use the module.
