{{DISPLAYTITLE:eselect}}

'''eselect''' is a tool for administration and configuration on Gentoo systems. It ''will'' modify the systemâ€™s behaviour and should be used with care by the system administrator. eselect is a modular framework for writing configuration utilities. It consists of:

* A main program called <tt>eselect</tt>;
* Various modules ({{Path|*.eselect}} files) which carry out different tasks;
* Several libraries which help ensure consistent behaviour and simplify the creation of new modules.

A module provides several actions. Actions typically either display some information (<tt>list</tt> and <tt>show</tt> actions are common) or update the system somehow (for example, <tt>set</tt> and <tt>update</tt>). Each module also provides <tt>help</tt> and <tt>usage</tt> actions which explain how to use the module.
