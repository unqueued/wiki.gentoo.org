The Gentoo Embedded Handbook is the center point for all Embedded work done with Gentoo. It aims to cover just about all aspects of the process - from theory, to design, to practice.

== General topics ==

Embedded fundamentals you need before playing with hardware.

;[[/General/Introduction|Introduction]]
:An introduction into the world of embedded, cross-compilers, and dragons.
;[[/General/Creating a cross-compiler|Creating a cross-compiler]]
:Build a cross-compiler on your machine!
;[[/General/Cross-compiling with Portage|Cross-compiling with Portage]]
:Leverage Portage as a cross-compiling package manager.
;[[/General/Cross-compiling the kernel|Cross-compiling the kernel]]
:Cross-compile a kernel for your system with flair!
;[[/General/Compiling with qemu user chroot|Compiling with qemu user chroot]]
:How To compile with QEMU user.
;[[/General/Frequently asked questions|Frequently asked questions]]
:FAQs for Gentoo Embedded.

== Emulators ==

Software emulation of systems can often times be as good (if not better) than the real thing.

;[[/Emulators/Qemu|Qemu]]
:A generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer for x86, x86_64, arm, sparc, powerpc, mips, m68k (coldfire), and superh.
;[[/Emulators/SkyEye|SkyEye]]
:ARM embedded hardware simulator.
;[[/Emulators/Armulator|Armulator]]
:Emulate armnommu/uClinux (no-mmu Linux) in GDB.
;[[/Emulators/Softgun|Softgun]]
:ARM software emulator.
;[[/Emulators/Hercules|Hercules]]
:Hercules System/370, ESA/390 and zArchitecture Mainframe Emulator.

== Bootloaders ==

From the obscure to the obscene, we'll cover some of the common bootloaders out there and how to get your feet wet with them.

;[[/Bootloaders/Das U-Boot|Das U-Boot]]
:The Universal Bootloader which supports every embedded architecture out there.
;[[/Bootloaders/NeTTrom|NeTTrom]]
:Simple bootloader on NetWinders.
;[[/Bootloaders/RedBoot|RedBoot]]
:Small bootloader based on eCos which supports every embedded architecture out there.
;[[/Bootloaders/SH-LILO|SH-LILO]]
:Port of LILO to SuperH which tends to be pretty common on that architecture.

== Boards ==

Some boards are fun while others can be a PITA; we'll cover many of the common gotchas with systems out there.

;[[/Boards/Hammerboard and Nailboard|Hammerboard and Nailboard]]
:Little-endian armv4l board.
;[[/Boards/LANTank|LANTank]]
:Little-endian SuperH based NAS (using internal IDE) from I-O Data.

:Little-endian ARMv7-A from Beagleboard.org.
;[[/Boards/BeagleBone Black|BeagleBone Black]]
:Little-endian ARMv7-A from Beagleboard.org.

== Beyond ==

A handbook can only go so far, so here we list resources to go the distance when we can't get you there.

;[[/Beyond/Communication|Communication]]
:Gentoo Embedded communication channels.
;[[/Beyond/Contributing|Contributing]]
:Gentoo Embedded and you: the answer to the ever prevalent "What can I do?" question.
