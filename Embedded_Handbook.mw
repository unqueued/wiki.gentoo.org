The Gentoo Embedded Handbook is the center point for all Embedded work done with Gentoo. It aims to cover just about all aspects of the process - from theory, to design, to practice.

== General topics ==

Embedded fundamentals you need before playing with hardware.

;Introduction
:An introduction into the world of embedded, cross-compilers, and dragons.
;Creating a Cross-Compiler
:Build a cross-compiler on your machine!
;Cross-Compiling with Portage
:Leverage Portage as a cross-compiling package manager.
;Cross-Compiling The Kernel
:Cross-compile a kernel for your system with flair!
;Compiling with qemu user chroot
:How To compile with QEMU user.
;Frequently asked questions
:FAQs for Gentoo Embedded.

== Emulators ==

Software emulation of systems can often times be as good (if not better) than the real thing.

;Qemu
:A generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer for x86, x86_64, arm, sparc, powerpc, mips, m68k (coldfire), and superh.
;SkyEye
:ARM embedded hardware simulator.
;Armulator
:Emulate armnommu/uClinux (no-mmu Linux) in GDB.
;Softgun
:ARM software emulator.
;Hercules
:Hercules System/370, ESA/390 and zArchitecture Mainframe Emulator.

== Bootloaders ==

From the obscure to the obscene, we'll cover some of the common bootloaders out there and how to get your feet wet with them.

;Das U-Boot
:The Universal Bootloader which supports every embedded architecture out there.
;NeTTrom
:Simple bootloader on NetWinders.
;RedBoot
:Small bootloader based on eCos which supports every embedded architecture out there.
;SH-LILO
:Port of LILO to SuperH which tends to be pretty common on that architecture.

== Boards ==

Some boards are fun while others can be a PITA; we'll cover many of the common gotchas with systems out there.

;Hammer/Nailboard
:Little-endian armv4l board.
;LANTank
:Little-endian SuperH based NAS (using internal IDE) from I-O Data.
;NetWinder
:Little-endian ARMv4 based network server from Rebel.
;NSLU2
:Big-endian arm based NAS (using external USB) from Linksys.
;QNAP TurboStation 109/209/409
:Little-endian ARMv5TE NAS from QNAP.
;Marvell Sheevaplug
:Little-endian ARMv5TE from Marvell.
;ACME SYSTEMS Netus G20
:Netus G20 (ARMv5TE) from ACME SYSTEMS
;Genesi Efika MX
:Little-endian ARMv7-A from Genesi USA.
;Pandaboard
:Little-endian ARMv7-A from pandaboard.org.
;Trimslice
:Little-endian ARMv7-A from Compulab/trimslice.com.
;Beaglebone
:Little-endian ARMv7-A from Beagleboard.org.
;BeagleBone Black
:Little-endian ARMv7-A from Beagleboard.org.

A handbook can only go so far, so here we list resources to go the distance when we can't get you there.

;Communication
:Gentoo Embedded communication channels.
;Contributing
:Gentoo Embedded and you: the answer to the ever prevalent "What can I do?" question.
;Vendors
:Information specific to vendors who wish to help out.
;Further learning
:External references to help you expand your embedded Linux knowledge.
