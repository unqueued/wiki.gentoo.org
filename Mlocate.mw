mlocate is a '''m'''erging '''locate''' and database package. The 'm' stands for "merging": updatedb reuses the existing database to avoid rereading most of the file system, which makes updatedb faster and does not trash the system caches as much.<ref>https://fedorahosted.org/mlocate/</ref> It can index several file systems including network file systems for network shares. This package is essential when attempting to finding local programs and documents.

== Installation ==
Possible '''USE''' flags for {{Package|sys-apps/mlocate}}
{{USEflag|nls}}

{{emerge|mlocate}}

Once installed mlocate can be invoked with the <kbd>locate</kbd> command.

== Configuration ==
To have network file systems ''included'' when mlocate's index is populated edit the pruning of the file system variable (<code>PRUNEFS</code>) in the {{Path|/etc/updatedb.conf}} file. Remove the <code>nfs</code>, <code>NFS</code>, and <code>nfs4</code>, <code>nfsd</code> entries:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/updatedb.conf|title=Include network file systems example|lang=bash|1=
# This file sets variables that are used by updatedb.
# For more info, see the updatedb.conf(5) manpage.

# Filesystems that are pruned from updatedb database
PRUNEFS="afs anon_inodefs auto autofs bdev binfmt binfmt_misc cgroup cifs coda configfs cramfs cpuset debugfs devfs devpts devtmpfs ecryptfs eventpollfs exofs futexfs ftpfs fuse fusectl gfs gfs2 hostfs hugetlbfs inotifyfs iso9660 jffs2 lustre misc mqueue ncpfs nnpfs ocfs ocfs2 pipefs proc ramfs rpc_pipefs securityfs selinuxfs sfs shfs smbfs sockfs spufs sshfs subfs supermount sysfs tmpfs ubifs udf usbfs vboxsf vperfctrfs"

# Paths which are pruned from updatedb database
PRUNEPATHS="/tmp /var/tmp /var/cache /var/lock /var/run /var/spool"

# Folder names that are pruned from updatedb database
PRUNENAMES=".git .hg .svn CVS"

# Skip bind mounts.
PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS="yes"
}}

== Usage ==
Upon installation, the <kbd>updatedb</kbd> command will automatically be added as a scheduled cron job. To index the files manually, run:
{{RootCmd|updatedb}}

To find all Firefox executables
{{RootCmd|locate firefox {{!}} grep bin}}
