Redshift is [[Article description::an automatic color temperature adjustment to help reduce monitor eye strain induced by working in low-light conditions.]] Depending on the location (longitude and latitude) of the user's computer system, Redshift will change the color of the screen from the default bluish color to a orange/reddish color during evening hours, and then back again to bluish tint during daylight hours.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/redshift}}

=== Emerge ===

After setting necessary USE flags, install Redshift:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/redshift}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

A configuration file can be created in each users home directory at {{Path|~/.config/redshift.conf}}

In order for Redshift to start, it will require longitude and latitude information inside the configuration file.

{{Cmd|redshift -l manual:help}}

=== Saving lon/lat ===

Redshift can be quickly established in working order by adding correct location information into the configuration file. Lat/Lon values can be found searching for the closest city or region at [https://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia] or with a map service such as [http://www.openstreetmap.org/ OpenStreetMap].

When using OpenScreetMap, simply search for the location. When it appears on the map tiles click the {{Path|Export}} button (should be near the top left). The center of the displayed tiles will be the exact Lat/Lon location. The Lat value is the second number from the end displayed in the URL. The Lon value is the last number on the end.

A finished {{Path|.conf}} file will look something like this:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/redshift.conf|lang=bash|1=
[manual]
lat=47.6587803
lon=-117.4260466
}}

== Service ==

=== OpenRC ===

Redshift does not currently include an OpenRC init script.

=== systemd ===

{{Cmd
|systemctl --user enable redshift.service
|systemctl --user start redshift.service
}}
== Usage ==

=== Invocation ===

{{Cmd|redshift -h|output=<pre>
Usage: redshift -l LAT:LON -t DAY:NIGHT [OPTIONS...]

Set color temperature of display according to time of day.

  -h		Display this help message
  -v		Verbose output
  -V		Show program version

  -b DAY:NIGHT	Screen brightness to apply (between 0.1 and 1.0)
  -c FILE	Load settings from specified configuration file
  -g R:G:B	Additional gamma correction to apply
  -l LAT:LON	Your current location
  -l PROVIDER	Select provider for automatic location updates
  		(Type `list' to see available providers)
  -m METHOD	Method to use to set color temperature
  		(Type `list' to see available methods)
  -o		One shot mode (do not continuously adjust color temperature)
  -O TEMP	One shot manual mode (set color temperature)
  -p		Print mode (only print parameters and exit)
  -x		Reset mode (remove adjustment from screen)
  -r		Disable temperature transitions
  -t DAY:NIGHT	Color temperature to set at daytime/night

The neutral temperature is 6500K. Using this value will not
change the color temperature of the display. Setting the
color temperature to a value higher than this results in
more blue light, and setting a lower value will result in
more red light.

Default values:

  Daytime temperature: 5500K
  Night temperature: 3500K
