<!-- Description goes here: --> 
In GSoC 2011 an LDAP authentication backend has been written (in Python/Django) for Gentoo infrastructure. This has to get improved. It needs to parse (or read in some other way) the ACL rules from the LDAP server, instead of committing the ACL in the webapp itself.
