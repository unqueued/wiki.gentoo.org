'''Completed in 2013'''

In GSoC 2011 an LDAP authentication backend has been written (in Python/Django) for Gentoo infrastructure so that we could do useful things on our websites like have a single sign-on across all Gentoo sites (forums, bugs, etc) and potentially customize our homepage for specific users. This has to get improved. It needs to parse (or read in some other way) the ACL rules from the LDAP server, instead of committing the ACL in the webapp itself.
