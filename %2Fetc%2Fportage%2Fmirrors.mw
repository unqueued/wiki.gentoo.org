{{Path|/etc/portage/mirrors}} is a file that is used to modify mirror behavior. It is useful for defining a local mirror that can contain fetch-restricted packages when using multiple Gentoo machines.

Portage will check the {{Path|/etc/portage/mirrors}} file before looking at <code>GENTOO_MIRRORS</code> in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}

== Example ==

{{CodeBox|filename=/etc/portage/mirrors|title=Portage mirror example|1=
# A list of local, private mirrors used by a company
local ftp://192.168.0.3/mirrors/gentoo http://192.168.0.4/distfiles

# People in Japan would want to use the Japanese mirror first
sourceforge http://keihanna.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge

# People in Tawain would want to use the local GNU mirror first
gnu ftp://ftp.nctu.edu.tw/UNIX/gnu/
}}
