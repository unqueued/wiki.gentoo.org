This article describes the setup of [[power management]] for [[:Category:Processors|processors]].

== CPU 주파수 조절 ==

CPU 주파수 조절은 "동작중" 전원을 절약하고 칩에서 발생하는 열의 양을 줄이려는 목적으로 자동으로 조절할 수 있는 주파수를 다루는 기술입니다.

=== 설치 ===

==== BIOS ====

일부 기능은 [[BIOS]]에서 켜고 끌 수 있습니다. 다음 기능을 켰는지 확인하십시오:
* "Processor C1E support"
* "Enhanced Speedstep (EIST)"

==== 커널 ====

다음 커널 옵션을 활성화하십시오:

{{KernelBox|title=CPU 전원 관리 옵션 활성화|1=
Power management and ACPI options  --->
     [*] ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support  --->
         <*>   Processor
     CPU Frequency scaling  --->
         [*] CPU Frequency scaling
             Default CPUFreq governor (ondemand)  --->
                 Select a default governor; see below table
                 Default is:
                 ondemand
             x86 CPU frequency scaling drivers  --->
                 Select a driver, see below table
}}

이 프로파일에 기반하여 주파수를 바꾸는 역할을 담당하는 정책 설정이 필요합니다:

{| class="table"
|+ Default CPUFreq governor
|-
! Option
! Module
! Supported Processors
! Note
|-
| 'performance' governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_performance}}
| Sets the frequency statically to the highest available CPU frequency.
|
|-
| 'powersave' governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_powersave}}
| Sets the frequency statically to the lowest available CPU frequency.
| Can't be set as default governor
|-
| 'userspace' governor for userspace frequency scaling
| {{ta|cpufreq_userspace}}
| To set the CPU frequency manually or when a userspace program shall be able to set the CPU dynamically.
|
|-
| 'ondemand' cpufreq policy governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_ondemand}} 
| Does a periodic polling and changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.
| recommend
|-
| 'conservative' cpufreq governor
| {{ta|cpufreq_conservative}}
| Similar to ondemand. The frequency is gracefully increased and decreased rather than jumping to 100% when speed is required.
|

| AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon 64, AMD Turion 64

|-
| Intel Enhanced SpeedStep (deprecated)
| {{ta|speedstep_centrino}}
| Intel Pentium M (Centrino), Intel Xeon
| Deprecate, use '''ACPI Processor P-States driver''' instead.
|-
| Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation
| {{ta|p4-clockmod}}
| Intel Pentium 4, Intel XEON
| Causes severe slowdowns and noticeable latencies
|}

== Ticks ==

The processor saves the most energy when the processor stays longer in power savings mode, so reduce the amount of ticks that wakes the processor up.

=== 설치 ===

==== BIOS ====

Some functions can be enabled or disabled in the [[BIOS]]. Check that the following are enabled:
* "HPET"
* "Multimedia timer"

==== 커널 ====

다음 커널 옵션을 활성화하십시오:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling tick optimizing functions in the kernel|1=
Processor type and features  --->
   [*] Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks)
   [*] High Resolution Timer Support
   [*] HPET Timer Support
}}

{{Note|These options now appear to be under "General setup" -> "Timers subsystem".}}

== PowerTOP ==

[[PowerTOP]] is a utility designed to measure, explain and minimize a computer's electrical power consumption.

=== 설치 ===

==== 커널 ====

Please refer to the [[PowerTOP#Kernel|Kernel section]] in the [[PowerTOP]] article for more information.

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling powertop functions|1=
Power management and ACPI options  --->
   [*] Power Management Debug Support
   [*]   Extra PM attributes in sysfs for low-level debugging/testing
Kernel hacking  --->
   [*] Kernel debugging
   [*] Collect kernel timers statistics
}}

==== 프로그램 ====

{{Package|sys-power/powertop}}을 설치하십시오:

{{USEflag
|unicode+yes
|X
}}

{{Emerge|sys-power/powertop}}

{{Important|For kernel 3.3 onwards, one will need to enable the following kernel options (maybe incomplete list) to get proper support. Some of the following config are already enabled in the previous graphical kernel configuration. One can use the following to quickly check if the required options are set or not. The last two options are not mandatory.}}
{{FileBox|filename=/usr/src/linux/.config|1=
CONFIG_NO_HZ
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS
CONFIG_HPET_TIMER
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND
CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE
CONFIG_TIMER_STATS
CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS
CONFIG_PERF_COUNTERS
CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS
CONFIG_TRACING
# These do not seem to be mandatory:
CONFIG_EVENT_POWER_TRACING_DEPRECATED
CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS_POWER}}

==== 사용법 ====

When [[PowerTOP|powertop]] is ran, it sorts the running processes in order of how often they cause the processor to wake up.

== Hprofile ==

It is possible to change the active CPU governer using a simple command:

{{RootCmd|for c in $(ls -d /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*); do
echo ondemand >$c/cpufreq/scaling_governor; done}}

Read {{Path|/etc/local.d/README}} to learn how to execute this command on startup.

Applications such as {{Package|sys-power/cpupower}} do little more than the above but with some interface on top of it. However, having to run certain commands as root depending on the system usage is not efficient for most users. It is better to automate some of the decisions of governing CPU frequency. For instance, when not wired to AC power, most users would like to have the system in a power saving mode.

This is where [[Hprofile]] comes into play. Please refer to its article for more information and configuration.
