''synaptics'' is the open source input driver for Synaptics and ALPS touchpads.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

You need to activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|
Device Drivers  --->
   Input device support  --->
      <*>   Event interface
      [*]   Mice  --->
         <*>   PS/2 mouse
}}

{{Note|You may also need additional drivers under the Mice menu to support your touchpad. i.e. "Synaptics PS/2 mouse protocol extension". The touchpad may also be USB, not PS/2.  If you are unsure, select multiple drivers and check what the kernel uses later with "lspci -k".}}

=== Driver ===

{{INPUT_DEVICES|synaptics libinput}}

== Configuration ==

The driver has a lot options to tune it to your needs. See the ''synaptics'' [[man page]] for more information.

=== Fixed configuration ===

Referring to [[xorg.conf]] there should have a {{Path|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d}} directory on the system. If there is none create one:

{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d}}

Configure file {{Path|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf}} as in the example below:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf|lang=text|
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad catchall"
        Driver "synaptics"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Option "VertEdgeScroll" "on"
        Option      "CircularScrolling"         "on"
        Option      "VertScrollDelta"          "-111"
        Option      "HorizScrollDelta"         "-111"
        Option      "TapButton1"       	          "1"
EndSection
}}

=== Configuration at runtime ===

You need to enable above option to be able to configure the driver also at runtime. Changes at runtime will be lost with the next start of the X-server. To keep them, add them to the above config file.

You can configure the driver with the program ''<code>synclient</code>''. Some examples:

List all parameters:

{{Cmd|synclient -l}}

Cut the right side of the touch area to expand the vertical scroll area:

{{Cmd|synclient RightEdge{{=}}5000}}

Finding the right edge parameter:

{{Cmd|synclient -m 50}}

Disable the mouse click function:

{{Cmd|synclient MaxTapTime{{=}}0}}

Finally, You can dump Your handpicked configuration to the {{Path|99-synaptics}} file pasting output of the following command inside the <code>InputClass</code> section:

{{Cmd|synclient -l {{!}} sed -e '1d' -e 's/^ \+/Option\t"/g' -e 's/ \+{{=}} /"\t"/g' -e 's/$/"/g'}}

Alternatively there is the [[KDE]] systemsettings module {{Package|kde-misc/synaptiks}}:

{{Emerge|kde-misc/synaptiks}}
