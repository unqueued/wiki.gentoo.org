{{DISPLAYTITLE:synaptics}}
''synaptics'' is the [[X.Org]] input driver for Synaptics and ALPS touchpads.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Input device support  --->
        <*>   Event interface
        [*]   Mice  --->
              <*>   PS/2 mouse
</pre>}}

=== Driver ===
{{INPUT_DEVICES|synaptics}}

== Configuration ==
The driver has alot options to tune it to your needs. For a detailed description of the options see the [[man page]]:
{{Cmd|man synaptics}}

=== Fixed Configuration ===
As an example you can enable an option to configure the driver also at runtime. To do so you have to change your [[xorg.conf]]:
{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf/99-synaptics||
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "All touchpads"
        Option SHMConfig "on"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
EndSection
}}

=== Configuration at runtime ===
You need to enable above option to be able to configure the driver also at runtime. Changes at runtime will be lost with the next start of the X-server. To keep them, add them to the above config file.

You can configure the driver with the program ''<code>synclient</code>''. Some examples:
* List all parameters:
{{Cmd|synclient -l}}
* Cut the right side of the touch area to expand the vertical scroll area:
{{Cmd|synclient RightEdge{{=}}5000}}
* Finding the right edge parameter:
{{Cmd|synclient -m 50}}
* Disable the mouse click function:
{{Cmd|synclient MaxTapTime{{=}}0}}


Alternativly there is the [[KDE SC 4|KDE]] systemsettings module {{Package|kde-misc/synaptiks}}:
