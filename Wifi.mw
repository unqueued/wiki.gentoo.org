This article describes the setup of a Wifi network device.

== Installation ==
=== Hardware detection ===
To choose the right driver, first detect the used Wifi controllers. You can use [[Hardware detection#lspci|lspci]] for this task:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep --color -i network}}

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
[*] Networking support  --->
    [*]   Wireless  --->
          [*]   Improved wireless configuration API
          [*]   Generic IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack (mac80211)

          Optionally enable a Wifi LED:
          [*]   Enable LED triggers

Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Network device support  --->
        Wireless LAN  --->
            [*] Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11)

            Select the driver for your Wifi network device, e.g.:
            <*> Broadcom 43xx wireless support (mac80211 stack) (b43)
            [*]    Support for 802.11n (N-PHY) devices
            [*]    Support for low-power (LP-PHY) devices
            [*]    Support for HT-PHY (high throughput) devices
            <*> Intel Wireless WiFi Next Gen AGN - Wireless-N/Advanced-N/Ultimate-N (iwlwifi)
            <*> Intel Wireless WiFi 4965AGN (iwl4965)
            <*> Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG/BG Network Connection (iwl3945)
</pre>}}

=== Firmware ===
Besides the kernel driver, you will also need firmware:

If there is a package, you can simply [[emerge]] it, e.g for {{Package|iwl3945-ucode}}:
{{Emerge|iwl3945-ucode}}

If there is no package, you have to download the firmware and move it to <tt>/lib/firmware</tt> yourself.

== Configuration ==
* [[Network management]]

== Advanced Configuration ==
* [[Power management/Wifi|Power management]]
