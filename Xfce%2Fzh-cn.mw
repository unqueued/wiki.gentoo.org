引用 [http://xfce.org/ xfce.org]网站的话：“Xfce 是类Unix操作系统上的 [[Article description::轻量级 [[desktop environment|桌面环境]] 。]] 虽然它致力于快速与低资源消耗，但仍然具有视觉吸引力且易于使用。”

== 安装 ==

=== 避免不必要的依赖 ===

避免可选的GNOME支持和包将使系统更加精简，这部分完全是可选的：如果目标是使系统保持较小而不是较大，则以这种方式进行。

确保系统使用基本的“desktop” [[Profile (Portage)|profile]]配置文件：

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set default/linux/amd64/17.0/desktop}}

{{Package|app-text/poppler}} 默认具有 <code>+qt5</code> ：

{{FileBox|title=取消设置poppler的qt5 USE标记|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/xfce|1=
app-text/poppler -qt5
}}

当然，如果需要， <code>-qt5</code> 也可以在 {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} 中全局设置。

=== 设置 XFCE_PLUGINS === 

在 {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}中，添加并自定义 <var>XFCE_PLUGINS</var> 变量：

{{FileBox|title=设置 XFCE_PLUGINS|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
XFCE_PLUGINS="clock power trash"
}}

以上选项可能会改变；当前列表可以在 [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/profiles/desc/xfce_plugins.desc?id=0c35e2aaa3616dbd54810a083d65c63667abfd37 ${PORTDIR}/profiles/desc/xfce_plugins.desc]中找到。

=== 安装（Emerge） ===

是时候安装完整的Xfce桌面了！

如果没有在 {{c|emerge}} 命令中明确包含 {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}} ，则 {{Package|virtual/notification-daemon}} 将在GNOME的 {{Package|x11-misc/notification-daemon}} 中进行绘制。因此，将它与 {{Package|xfce-base/xfce4-meta}} 一起安装，然后取消选择它，使其不包含在world文件中：

{{Emerge|xfce-base/xfce4-meta xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}}

{{Emerge|params+=--deselect{{=}}y|xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}}

当然，也可以只选择所需的包：

{{Emerge|xfce-base/xfwm4 xfce-base/xfce4-panel}}

== 配置 ==

=== 显示管理器 ===

可以使用显示管理器启动Xfce，请参阅[[display manager]]中相关文章以配置显示管理器。

大多数显示管理器使用 {{Path|*.desktop}} 文件来配置可用会话，以下是一个示例桌面文件：

{{FileBox|title=用于显示管理器的Xfce4 desktop 文件|filename=xfce4.desktop|lang=ini|1=
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Xfce4
Comment=Use this session to run Xfce 4 as desktop environment
Exec=/usr/bin/startxfce4
Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/xfce4_xicon1.png
Type=Application
}}

desktop文件可以放置在显示管理器的正确位置。

=== Starting Xfce without a display manager ===

{{c|startx}} and {{c|startxfce4}} are two of the [[X without Display Manager|readily available options]] for starting Xfce without using a display manager.

==== startx ====

When using {{c|startx}}, create a {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} file with the following contents:

{{FileBox|title=Starting xfce4 when invoking startx|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec startxfce4
}}

When experiencing authorization or permissions issues within xfce4 in a OpenRC profile (symptoms include being unable to open power manager and unable to suspend/hibernate) be sure the {{Package|sys-auth/consolekit}} package has been merged with the <code>pm-utils</code> USE flag set. Then replace the above line in {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} with the following (see this entry on the [https://forums-lb.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7920810.html?sid=e76984319cf592c57047f87ec689c327 Gentoo Forums] for more information):

{{FileBox|title=Starting xfce4 the right way when invoking startx|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
ck-launch-session dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session xfce4-session
}}

==== startxfce4 ====

To launch the Xfce4 desktop simply type {{c|startxfce4}} at the command-line and press enter:

{{Cmd|startxfce4}}

Xfce is a desktop environment and as such can be tuned and tailored to the needs of (almost) every user. In this section, a number of popular (or more challenging) aspects are covered.

=== Volume keys ===

==== xfce4-volumed ====

Install {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed}} to manage the volume keys  (deprecated - Suggested replacements include {{Package|media-sound/tudor-volumed}} or use key binds in a Window Manager or mixer):

{{Emerge|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed}}

When using pulseaudio with xfce4, use {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed-pulse}}:

{{Emerge|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed-pulse}}

==== Keyboard shortcuts ====

Run {{c|xfce4-keyboard-settings}} to bind the following keys:

* {{Key|volume up}} button: amixer set Master 5%+
* {{Key|volume down}} button: amixer set Master 5%-
* {{Key|mute}} button: amixer set Master toggle

=== Consistent GTK+ 3 themes ===

==== Native Xfce theme engine ====

Xfce's own theme engine, {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}}, was updated in version 3.0, which implements native support for GTK+ 3 with no further configuration.

Assuming that the <code>gtk3</code> USE flag is set, the GTK+ 3 version (revision 300 or higher) should be pulled in by default if {{Package|xfce-base/xfce4-meta}} or {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}} were installed with a <code>--deep</code> world upgrade.

If not simply:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}}

This should pull in the right version of {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}} through the use of a specific <code>SLOT</code>.

After emerging the GTK+ 3 version of {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}}, applications using GTK+ 3 should now blend nicely with applications using GTK+ 2 when one of the native Xfce themes is used.

==== Greybird theme ====

Another option is to use the [http://shimmerproject.org/project/greybird/ Greybird] theme, which has support for GTK+ 2, GTK+ 3, xfwm4, emerald, and metacity:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/greybird}}

Go to {{Path|Xfce menu}} -> {{Path|Settings}} -> {{Path|Appearance}}. Or run {{c|xfce4-appearance-settings}}. Select "Greybird" from the "Style" list.

Now GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3 applications should have a consistent look.

=== Other themes ===

Other themes available in Portage that are compatible with XFCE can be emerged with the following list:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/clearlooks-phenix x11-themes/gnome-themes-standard x11-themes/gtk-engines-aurora x11-themes/light-themes x11-themes/murrine-themes x11-themes/nimbus x11-themes/oxygen-molecule x11-themes/redhat-artwork x11-themes/shiki-colors x11-themes/tactile3 x11-themes/zukini}}

=== Additional applications ===

There are a number of additional applications that are part of Xfce.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Enable vertical window snapping ===

Most modern desktop environments have vertical window snapping enabled by default. This is also possible in Xfce, but not by default. To enable, navigate to: {{Path|Settings}} → {{Path|Window manager}} → {{Path|Advanced tab}}.

* Make sure the "Snap windows to screen border" checkbox has been ''checked''.
* Make sure the checkboxes under "Wrap workspaces when reaching the screen edge" have been ''unchecked''. These interfere with vertical window snapping.

Once the checkboxes are set it should be now possible to drag a window to the right or left side of the screen, which should cause the window to resize to 50% of the screen width.

Keyboard shortcuts can be set in order to do this via the typical {{Key|Super}}+{{Key|←}} or {{Key|Super}}+{{Key|→}} behavior. Navigate to {{Path|Settings}} → {{Path|Window manager}} → {{Path|Keyboard tab}}.

Set the "Tile window to the left" and "Tile window to the right" actions with the {{Key|Super}}+{{Key|←}} and {{Key|Super}}+{{Key|→}} key combinations respectively.

=== Audio mixer complains about missing pavucontrol binary ===

Clicking the speaker (audio) icon in the panel and then selecting {{Path|Audio mixer...}} results in a message saying "pavucontrol binary not found".

The solution is to install {{Package|media-sound/pavucontrol}}:

{{Emerge|media-sound/pavucontrol}}

=== Program starting hotkeys are not working / Colors not changeable from appearance ===

Xfce can have hotkeys for both starting an application as well as modifying the behavior of an already running application or setting. An example of behavior hotkey is the {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|D}} combination, which minimizes all windows to show the deskop (and vice-versa).

Assuming that hotkeys for starting an application (such as {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|F2}} to start the application finder) are not working, while the application can be started from the menu, then Consolekit is not running. Start it, and make sure that it gets started at boot time:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/consolekit start}}

{{RootCmd|rc-update add consolekit default}}

This will also start D-Bus, a prerequisite for Consolekit. Restart X to enjoy the new hotkeys and colors.
