=== The Problem ===
An error occurs when building and linking a package which hasn't had 'libtool' files updated for a long time.
When linking, libtool throws away the flag '-flto', which apparently does not know because 'libtool' generated by autoreconf + ./configure somewhen has become ancient and obsolete.

=== How to find affected packages ===
Try to propagate the flag '-flto' by supplementing CFLAGS, or CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS with it. If linking fails with the message 'not an object or archive' or something similar this is the case. It is highly likely that libtool needs to be updated according to recent autotools

=== Packages required to get rid of the problem ===
>=sys-devel/autoconf-2.69-r4 <br/>
>=sys-devel/automake-1.15.1-r2 <br/>
>=sys-devel/libtool-2.4.6-r3 <br/>
=== How to fix it ===
First of all, we must update automake, autoconf and libtool in our system. Refer to the [[Outdated_libtool#Packages required to get rid of the problem|clause]]

Different packages require different approaches to do away with the issue. The solution depends on how autotools-related files have been generated 

Here below the list of some packages and solutions are shown:

==== dev-libs/libdaemon ====
From the root of the project, execute <br/>
<code>
rm -rf m4/*
autoreconf --install --force
</code>

==== media-libs/libuninameslist ====
From the root of the project, execute <br/>
<code>
autoreconf --install --force
</code>

==== net-libs/libasyncns ====
From the root of the project, execute <br/>
<code>
autoreconf --install --force
</code>

==== sys-fs/inotify-tools ====
From the root of the project, execute <br/>
<code>
autoreconf --install --force
</code>

==== dev-libs/chmlib ====
From the root of the project, execute <br/>
<code>
autoreconf --install --force
</code>

==== media-libs/libid3tag ====
From the root of the project, execute <br/>
<code>
autoconf --force configure.ac > configure
</code>

==== app-crypt/mhash ====
From the root of the project, execute <br/>
<code>
autoreconf --install --force
</code>
