=== The Problem ===
An error occurs, when building and linking a package which hasn't had 'libtool' files updated for a long time.
When linking, libtool throws away the flag '-flto', which apparently does not know because 'libtool' generated by autoreconf + ./configure somewhen has become ancient and obsolete.

=== How to find affected packages ===

=== How to fix it ===

So, the solution is (from the root of the project):

 rm -rf m4/*
 autoreconf --install
