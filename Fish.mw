'''fish''' - the '''f'''riendly '''i'''nteractive '''sh'''ell.

fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for OS X, Linux, and the rest of the family. fish includes features like syntax highlighting, autosuggest-as-you-type, and fancy tab completions that just work, with no configuration required.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-shells/fish}}:

{{Emerge|app-shells/fish}}

== Caveats ==
Fish is not a POSIX 1003.1 compatible shell. It does not read {{Path|/etc/profile}}, {{Path|/etc/profile.env}}, or the {{Path|/etc/profile.d/*}} directories.

It is advised not to set fish as a default login shell. see {{Bug|545830}} for more details.

Some packages install files into {{Path|/etc/profile.d}} and are not compatible with fish. Not setting fish as system wide or user default allows the standard shell scripts to run on startup, ensures the environment variables are set correctly, and generally reduces the issues associated with using a non-Bash compatible terminal like fish. Those who really, truly, actually wish to set the fish shell can jump down to [[#Setting the fish shell as the login shell|Setting the fish shell as the login shell]]. For all other readers, it is best to proceed down the [[#.bashrc safety net|.bashrc safety net]] path.

==== .bashrc safety net ====

The following is a [https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3665#issuecomment-268527236 trick] suggested by one of the fish developers and the [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fish#Not_setting_fish_as_default_shell Arch wiki]. This enables the {{c|fish}} shell to inherit the {{c|bash}} environment (which written in and should be executed by the {{c|bash}} shell):

{{FileBox|filename=~/.bashrc|lang=bash|1=
if [[ $- != *i* ]] ; then
        # Shell is non-interactive.  Be done now!
        return
fi


# Put your fun stuff here.



# keep this line at the bottom of ~/.bashrc
[ -x /bin/fish ] && SHELL=/bin/fish exec /bin/fish
}}
Please note it should not be run for non-interactive shells, so make sure it's placed below the test for interactive shell.

Launch {{c|bash}} using:

{{Cmd|bash --rcfile /etc/profile}}

==== Setting the fish shell as the login shell ====

Those who really wish make {{c|fish}} their default login shell can change the shell:

{{Cmd|chsh -s /bin/fish}}

{{Warning|After setting {{c|fish}} as the login shell there probably will be entries missing in the <var>PATH</var> variable and some packages that rely on {{Path|/etc/profile.d}} broken.}}

== Configuration ==
fish starts by executing commands in {{path|~/.config/fish/config.fish}} . You can create it if it does not exist.
Since the version 2.0 it is possible to configure fish within a web browser session by running:
{{Cmd|fish_config}}

Fish can generate completions from man pages. To generate completions run:
{{Cmd|fish_update_completions}}
