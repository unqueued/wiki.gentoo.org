'''fish''' - the '''f'''riendly '''i'''nteractive '''sh'''ell.

fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for OS X, Linux, and the rest of the family. fish includes features like syntax highlighting, autosuggest-as-you-type, and fancy tab completions that just work, with no configuration required.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-shells/fish}}:

{{Emerge|app-shells/fish}}

== Caveats ==
Fish is not a POSIX 1003.1 compatible shell. It does not read {{Path|/etc/profile}}, {{Path|}}/etc/profile.env or {{Path|/etc/profile.d/*}}

It's advised not to set fish as a default login shell. see [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=545830 bug 545830]

Some packages install files into {{Path|/etc/profile.d}} and are not compatible with fish. Not setting fish as system wide or user default allows the sh scripts to run on startup, ensures the environment variables are set correctly, and generally reduces the issues associated with using a non-Bash compatible terminal like fish.
You can exec fish as a part of default {{Path|~/.bashrc}}:

==== .bashrc ====
{{FileBox|filename=~/.bashrc|lang=bash|1=
# keep this line at the bottom of ~/.bashrc
[ -x /bin/fish ] && SHELL=/bin/fish exec /bin/fish
}}
It's a  [https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3665#issuecomment-268527236 tick] suggested by one of the fish developers and [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fish#Not_setting_fish_as_default_shell arch-wiki]
that way you can still have all shell startup written in bash and let fish inherit it.

You can launch bash using:
{{Cmd|bash --rcfile /etc/profile}}



If you still wish you can make fish the default login shell, run:

{{Cmd|chsh -s /bin/fish}}

If you choose to set fish as you login shell you might find you with missing entries in your $PATH and some packages that rely on /etc/profile.d broken.
== Configuration ==
fish starts by executing commands in {{path|~/.config/fish/config.fish}} . You can create it if it does not exist.
Since the version 2.0 it is possible to configure fish within a webbrowser session by running:
{{Cmd|fish_config}}

Fish can generate completions from man pages. To generate completions run:
{{Cmd|fish_update_completions}}
