Integrated Intel HD Graphics uses I915 driver:
{{Kernel|Video Support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
        Graphics support  --->  
        <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
</pre>}}

=== Input Devices ===
The keyboard support for X11 is provided by evdev.

To make {{Key|Fn}} + {{Key|F5}} (brightness down) and {{Key|Fn}} + {{Key|F6}} (brightness up) function keys work it is needed to unspecify acpi_osi in GRUB.
{{File|/etc/default/grub|Brightness Keys Support|
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT{{=}}'quiet splash acpi_osi{{=}}'
}}
Nevertheless brightness set with keyboard will not synchronize with brightness set with KDE.

Touchpad support is provided through synaptics.
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Input Device Support|
INPUT_DEVICES{{=}}"evdev synaptics"
}}

Also you must enable CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2_ELANTECH in kernel.
