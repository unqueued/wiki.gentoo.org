=== Input Devices ===
The keyboard support for X11 is provided by evdev.

To make fn+f5 (brightness down) and fn+f6 (brightness up) function keys work it is needed to unspecify acpi_osi in grub.
{{File|/etc/default/grub|Brightness Keys Support|
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT{{=}}'quiet splash acpi_osi{{=}}'
}}
Nevertheless brightness set with keyboard will not synchronize with brightness set with KDE.

Touchpad support is provided through synaptics.
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Input Device Support|
INPUT_DEVICES{{=}}"evdev synaptics"
}}

Also you must enable CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2_ELANTECH in kernel.
