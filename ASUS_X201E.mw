        [*] Ethernet driver support  --->
            [*] Atheros devices  --->
                [*] Qualcomm Atheros AR816x/AR817x support
</pre>}}

=== 802.11 Wifi ===
Wifi is provided by Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 Wireless Network Adapter. ath9k driver is needed:
{{Kernel|Wifi Support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Network device support  --->  
        [*] Wireless LAN  --->
            [*] Atheros Wireless Cards  --->
                [*] Atheros 802.11n wireless cards support  --->
                    [*] Atheros ath9k PCI/PCIe bus support
</pre>}}

=== Bluetooth ===
Though Atheros AR9485 has integrated bluetooth, ath9k driver doesn't support it.

=== Input Devices ===
The keyboard support for X11 is provided by evdev.

To make fn+f5 (brightness down) and fn+f6 (brightness up) function keys work it is needed to unspecify acpi_osi in grub.
{{File|/etc/default/grub|Brightness Keys Support|
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT{{=}}'quiet splash acpi_osi{{=}}'
}}
Nevertheless brightness set with keyboard will not synchronize with brightness set with KDE.

Touchpad support is provided through synaptics.
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Input Device Support|
INPUT_DEVICES{{=}}"evdev synaptics"
}}

Also you must enable CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2_ELANTECH in kernel.
{{File|/usr/src/linux/.config|Touchpad support|
CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2_ELANTECH{{=}}y
}}
Double- and tripple- tapping and scroll will work, although 4- and 5- finger tap will not be recognized.
