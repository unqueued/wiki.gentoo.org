Go-mtpfs is a simple FUSE-based filesystem written in Go language for mounting Android devices as a MTP device.

{{Note|Newer Galaxy Devices (S3, S4, Note2, etc.) use their own MTP-stack and do not work reliably, although this should be fixed in newer versions. See [https://github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs/issues/29 Bug#29] for more details.}}

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===

Unmask two packages in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.keywords}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.keywords|1=
dev-libs/go-fuse **
sys-fs/go-mtpfs **
}}

=== Kernel ===

See the [[MTP]] meta article or the [[FUSE]] article for instructions on enabling FUSE support in the Linux kernel.

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|sys-fs/go-mtpfs}}:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/go-mtpfs}}

== Configuration ==

Appropriate users need to be in the <code>plugdev</code> group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <USER_NAME> plugdev}}

== Usage ==

[[Mount]]:

{{Cmd
|mkdir ~/AndroidDevice
|go-mtpfs ~/AndroidDevice &
}}

Note: If go-mtpfs is not ran in the background (with <code>&</code> at the end), another console will be needed to browse the device and unmount the device (when finished).

Unmount:

{{Cmd|fusermount -u ~/AndroidDevice}}

When the device is unmount, go-mtpfs will quit.

=== Bugs ===

# {{Package|dev-libs/go-fuse-9999}} right now has a bug [https://bugs.gentoo.org/638912 638912] that prevents it from building.
# MTP is very unreliable on some devices, old files & directories keep showing up, new ones don't get updated. One way to update media storage database is through [https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.gmail.jerickson314.sdscanner/ SD Scanner].
