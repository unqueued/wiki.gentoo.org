'''PHP''' is a general-purpose server-side scripting language to produce dynamic Web pages.

== Installation ==

=== dev-lang/php ===
Portage knows the global USE flag ''php'' for enabling support for PHP in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|dev-lang/php}} automatically:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
USE="... php ..."
</pre>}}
The most important USE flags of php, the SAPI (Server API) USE flags, are:
{{USEflag|package=dev-lang/php|desc=SAPIs
|apache2
|cgi
|cli+yes
|embed
|fpm
}}
Also check the other USE flags.

By default the ebuild installs the development {{Path|php.ini}} version. If you want to install the production version add the following to your {{Path|make.conf}}:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
PHP_INI_VERSION="production"
</pre>}}
Both versions of {{Path|php.ini}} can be found in {{Path|/usr/share/doc/php-*}}.

After chaning the preferred version of php.ini, you need to reinstall PHP:
{{Emerge|params=--oneshot|dev-lang/php}}

=== Extensions ===
If you want to install extensions, you can decide which versions of PHP you want extensions compiled for. This is done by setting the ''PHP_TARGETS'' variable:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
PHP_TARGETS="php5-4"
</pre>}}
You can also set more than one. Note that the php slot is named "5.4" and the corresponding PHP_TARGETS setting is php5-4. This is due to current restrictions on USE names.

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Running multiple versions of PHP ==
One of the great advantages of using Gentoo for PHP development is the version slotting. It is very simple to swap between multiple versions of PHP as well as run multiple versions simultaneously. This is all done with the eselect command provided by the {{Package|app-admin/eselect-php}} package which should get pulled in automatically with your installation. This allows you to run, for example, PHP 5.3 for your ''cli'' SAPI but PHP 5.4 on your web server. It also allows you to quickly test your application on different versions of PHP.

To list the available versions for the '''cli''' SAPI use:
{{RootCmd|eselect php list cli|output=<pre>
 [1]   php5.3
 [2]   php5.4 *
 [3]   php5.5
</pre>}}
The version marked with the * is the current active version, and to check the other SAPIs simply replace ''cli'' with ''fpm'',''cgi'',''apache2''.

To swap versions use:
{{RootCmd|eselect php set cli 1}}
where ''1'' corresponds to the number in the output of "show".

You are now running PHP 5.3 on command line.
{{RootCmd|php -v|output=<pre>
PHP 5.3.9-pl0-gentoo (cli) (built: Jan 30 2012 13:21:46)
</pre>}}

== Configuration ==
The PHP configuration is in {{Path|/etc/php}}, which contains one subdirectory for each SAPI for each PHP version, e.g. configuration files for the PHP-5.4 apache2 SAPI are installed in {{Path|/etc/php/apache2-php5.4}}.

To setup Apache to use PHP, see the [[Apache#PHP support|Apache]] article.

== Replacing PHP 5.4 with PHP 5.5 ==

Set the ''PHP_TARGETS'' variable.

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
PHP_TARGETS="php5-5"
</pre>}}

=== Installation ===
Install PHP 5.5:
{{Emerge|dev-lang/php:5.5}}

=== Replacing APC ===
If you are building with the ''opcache'' USE flag (the default) but need APC user-land functions such as ''apc_fetch()'', install APCu, which emulates APC but only has user caching functions. This may be necessary for older projects that rely on APC for caching.

If necessary, unmask it:
{{RootCmd|echo 'dev-php/pecl-apcu ~amd64' >> /etc/portage/package.use/your-preferred-file}}

Install APCu:
{{Emerge|dev-php/pecl-apcu}}

=== Switch to PHP 5.5 ===
Switch to it using ''eselect'' for all SAPIs:
{{RootCmd|eselect php set cli php5.5}}
{{RootCmd|eselect php set fpm php5.5}}

If you have other SAPIs, be sure to run ''eselect'' for those as well.

=== Re-install compatible extensions ===

Since changing ''PHP_TARGETS'' is technically a ''USE'' flag change, you will be able to simply emerge @world with flags checking for new ''USE'' flags and all extensions should re-build.

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use|@world}}

=== Uninstall incompatible extensions ===

Remove all old extensions that do not build for PHP 5.5. I recommend using ''eix'' for this task. Note that when piping to emerge, you cannot use interactive mode so ''--ask'' on the ''emerge'' command is not applicable here.

{{Emerge|eix}}
{{RootCmd|eix -I --use php_targets_php5-4 --not --use php_targets_php5-5 --only-names {{!}} xargs emerge -C}}

Be sure to migrate USE flags if you have specified versions in your ''package.use'' file(s).

Since you removed extensions, it may be useful to run a dependency clean up at this point for older ones that are no longer compatible.

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --depclean|}}

=== Uninstall PHP 5.4 ===
{{Emerge|param+=-C|dev-lang/php:5.4}}

=== Restart PHP-FPM ===

Restart PHP-FPM if you are using it.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/php-fpm restart}}
