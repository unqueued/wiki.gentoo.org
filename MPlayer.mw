'''MPlayer''' is a powerful command-line media player.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=media-video/mplayer}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|media-video/mplayer}}:

{{Emerge|media-video/mplayer}}

== Configuration ==

=== GUI tools ===

There are a number of different GUI's for MPlayer with different levels of functionality. Some notable ones include:

* {{Package|media-video/gnome-mplayer}}
* {{Package|media-video/kmplayer}}
* {{Package|media-video/smplayer}}

== Usage ==

=== Streaming videos from websites ===

MPlayer has the ability to stream videos from websites. As a prerequisite, {{Package|media-video/ffmpeg}} must have the <code>openssl</code> and <code>gnutls</code> USE flags enabled. To do this, simply enter the command:

{{Cmd|mplayer ''url''}}

Where ''url'' is the URL to the video.

== Tips ==

=== Disable screensaver while playing a video ===

Using qdbus (Qt/KDE):

{{FileBox|filename=~/.mplayer/config|1=
heartbeat-cmd="qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver SimulateUserActivity"
}}

For systems using xscreensaver alone:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.mplayer/config|1=
heartbeat-cmd="xscreensaver-command -deactivate >&- 2>&- &" 
}}

See [http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/faq.html#dvd this FAQ entry] for more informations.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== My video won't play! ===

MPlayer uses USE flags to enable and disable support for various codecs. If a particular type of file will not play in MPlayer, first check which USE flags MPlayer was emerged with. Update the USE flags to support for the format you are trying to play and recompile.
