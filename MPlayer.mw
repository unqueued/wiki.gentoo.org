== MPlayer GUI tools ==

There are a number of different GUI's for mplayer with different levels of functionality. Some notable ones are:

* {{Package|media-video/gnome-mplayer}}
* {{Package|media-video/kmplayer}}
* {{Package|media-video/smplayer}}

=== Troubleshooting ===
=== My video won't play! ===

mplayer uses USE flags to enable and disable support for various codecs. If a particular type of file won't play in mplayer, first check which USE flags it was emerged with. Update the USE flags to support for the format your trying to play and recompile.

== Tips ==
=== Disable screensaver while playing a video ===
Should work for any freedesktop-compliant environment (like KDE).
