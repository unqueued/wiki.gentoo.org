[http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/ RTorrent] is a highly configurable torrent client based on libtorrent and ncurses. 

== Installation ==
RTorrent is available in portage. A quick note on the USE flags before emerging:
{{USEflag
|color+++Add custom color support for torrent list
|daemon+++Ability to start rtorrent from init for a user
|debug++no
|ipv6
|test++no
|xml-rpc+++Support for xml-rpc library
}}
{{Emerge|net-p2p/rtorrent}}

== Configuration ==
The RTorrent configuration is stored in the user's ~/.rtorrent.rc. A lot can be configured, for this reason, the configuration is divided in sections. 

=== Basics ===
These options are pretty straightforward:
{{File|/home/user/.rtorrent.rc||<pre>
# Global upload and download rate in KiB. "0" for unlimited.
#download_rate = 0
upload_rate = 75

# Default directory to save the downloaded torrents.
directory = /home/user/media/

# Default session directory. When restarting rtorrent, the torrents from this directory will be restarted.
session = /home/wim/media/session
</pre>}}

=== Watching a Directory ===
You can configure RTorrent to watch one or more directories for new torrent files and queue them automatically. You can also set a download directory for each watch directory (rather than downloading to the default download directory).

{{File|/home/user/.rtorrent.rc||<pre>
# A watch directory downloading to the default location
schedule = watch_directory_3,5,300,load_start=/home/user/media/watch/*.torrent

# Watch directories with customized download directories
schedule = watch_directory_1,5,60,"load_start=/home/user/media/watch_series/*.torrent,d.set_directory=/home/user/media/series"
schedule = watch_directory_2,5,5,"load_start=/home/wim/media/watch_music/*.torrent,d.set_directory=/home/user/media/music"
schedule = watch_directory_3,5,300,"load_start=/home/user/media/watch_movies/*.torrent,d.set_directory=/home/user/media/movies"

# Restart torrents that have been copied back and stop those that have been deleted
schedule = tied_directory,1,30,start_tied=
schedule = untied_directory,1,30,close_untied=

# Close torrents when diskspace is low.
schedule = low_diskspace,5,60,close_low_diskspace=100M
</pre>}}

{{Note|Several commands can be scheduled to run depending on two values, ''start'' and ''interval''. The command in question is called every interval, beginning at start. The values can be seconds or a time format.}}
{{File|/home/user/.rtorrent.rc||<pre>
# Execute command after 5 seconds and again every 5 minutes
schedule = some_command,5,300,foo

# Execute command immediately and at 03:00
schedule = some_command,0,03:00,foo
default</pre>}}

=== Ratio Handling ===
You can control seed time by making it dependent on each torrent's ratio. Each torrent is seeded for a minimum of ''min.set'' percent. if a total of ''upload.set'' has been uploaded. If ''upload.set'' is not reached, it will seed a maximum of ''max.set'' percent. Read the [http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentRatioHandling wiki] on the libtorrent site for different ratio groups.
{{File|/home/user/.rtorrent.rc||<pre>
# First, enable the default ratio group, which controls all loaded torrents. Set the limits for the group next.
ratio.enable=
ratio.min.set=200
ratio.max.set=300
ratio.upload.set=20M
</pre>}}

== Adding a self-signed certificate ==
Some trackers use SSL certificates, however most are not signed for various reasons. rtorrent uses the database located in /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt. You also may want to use HTTPS because some ISPs (like Comcast) perform bandwidth shaping, effectively slowing down BitTorrent (regardless of whether your use is legitimate).

Add a certificate (if the domain was mytracker.net and the port was 443):
{{RootCmd|openssl s_client -connect mytracker.net:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null {{!}} sed -n '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/p' >> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt}}

You need to re-hash after adding a certificate:
{{RootCmd|c_rehash}}

Try with curl:
{{Cmd|curl https://mytracker.net:443}}

You should not get a warning regarding the self-signed certificate.

Restart rtorrent. If using the daemon:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/rtorrentd restart}}
