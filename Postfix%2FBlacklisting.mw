There are various spam blacklists which are publicly available and may assist you from limiting spam inbound to your mail server.

To enable them, add <code>reject_rbl_client</code> entries to your <code>main.cf</code> file's <code>smtpd_recipient_restriction</code> directive as follow.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/postfix/main.cf|title=Use blacklists|1=
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
   permit_sasl_authenticated,
   reject_invalid_hostname,
   reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
   reject_non_fqdn_sender,
   reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
   reject_unknown_sender_domain,
   reject_unknown_recipient_domain,
   permit_mynetworks,
   reject_rbl_client sbl.spamhaus.org,
   reject_rbl_client cbl.abuseat.org,
   reject_rbl_client dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net,
   permit}}

==Deployment==
Finally, tell postfix to reload its configuration for the changes to take effect.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/postfix reload}}

{{Note|By using '''reload''' instead of '''restart''', we are advised of any syntax errors we may have accidentally introduced and the daemon stays running under its current configuration instead of going down, which is what would happen if we used '''restart''' with a syntax error in <code>main.cf</code>!}}
