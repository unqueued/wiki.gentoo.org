'''Blacklisting''' is the process of banning specific IP addresses or address ranges from sending email to your server entirely.

==Introduction==
In the email server administration world, blacklisting generally refers to using a Realtime Black(hole) List (usually abbreviated to '''RBL''') service operating over the DNS protocol. There are various such RBL services publicly available. A good overview can be found [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_blacklists over at Wikipedia].

==Setup==
To enable them, add <code>reject_rbl_client</code> entries to your <code>main.cf</code> file's <code>smtpd_recipient_restriction</code> directive based upon the services you have selected, as follows.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/postfix/main.cf|title=Use blacklists|1=
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
   permit_sasl_authenticated,
   reject_invalid_hostname,
   reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
   reject_non_fqdn_sender,
   reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
   reject_unknown_sender_domain,
   reject_unknown_recipient_domain,
   permit_mynetworks,
   reject_rbl_client sbl.spamhaus.org,
   reject_rbl_client cbl.abuseat.org,
   reject_rbl_client dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net,
   permit}}

==Deployment==
Finally, tell postfix to reload its configuration for the changes to take effect.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/postfix reload}}

{{Note|By using '''reload''' instead of '''restart''', we are advised of any syntax errors we may have accidentally introduced and the daemon stays running under its current configuration instead of going down, which is what would happen if we used '''restart''' with a syntax error in <code>main.cf</code>!}}
