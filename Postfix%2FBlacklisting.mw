'''Blacklisting''' is the process of banning specific IP addresses or address ranges from sending email to your server entirely.

==Introduction==
In the email server administration world, blacklisting generally refers to using a Realtime Black(hole) List (usually abbreviated to '''RBL''') service operating over the DNS protocol.

There are various RBL services available. A good overview is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_blacklists over at Wikipedia's list of DNS blacklists]. Another fairly useful resource is [http://www.dnsbl.info DNSBL.info] which allows you to check if your server's IP address block has been listed in any of the major RBLs.

Basically, when a computer asks your system to receive some mail, your system sends a DNS query to the RBL provider(s) including the identity of that sending system. If the system is blacklisted, the response will indicate so, and the mail will be rejected.

{{Note|By using an RBL you are basically trusting them to audit your inbound mail for you. This is a very significant type of trust to extend to a third party. If the RBL goes down, all of your inbound mail may get rejected! ([http://www.dnsbl.info/dul-ru-offline.php Example]) Therefore, you are probably better off picking a smaller number of more widely used RBLs than simply enabling all of them!}}

==Setup==
To enable them, add <code>reject_rbl_client</code> entries to your <code>main.cf</code> file's <code>smtpd_recipient_restriction</code> directive based upon the services you have selected, as follows.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/postfix/main.cf|title=Use blacklists|1=
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
   permit_sasl_authenticated,
   reject_invalid_hostname,
   reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
   reject_non_fqdn_sender,
   reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
   reject_unknown_sender_domain,
   reject_unknown_recipient_domain,
   permit_mynetworks,
   reject_rbl_client sbl.spamhaus.org,
   reject_rbl_client cbl.abuseat.org,
   reject_rbl_client dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net,
   permit}}

==Deployment==
Finally, tell postfix to reload its configuration for the changes to take effect.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/postfix reload}}

{{Note|By using '''reload''' instead of '''restart''', we are advised of any syntax errors we may have accidentally introduced and the daemon stays running under its current configuration instead of going down, which is what would happen if we used '''restart''' with a syntax error in <code>main.cf</code>!}}
