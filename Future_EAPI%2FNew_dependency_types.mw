This page provides a summary of new dependency types requested for various features.

== The types ==
<!-- please keep the list sorted lexically -->

;<var>BADEPEND</var> (aka <var>CDEPEND</var>)
:''Build-against dependencies''; {{Bug|392239}}. It would be used to inject additional <var>DEPEND</var> into a package being built against the package in question.
:'''Use case''': xorg packages, where e.g. building against ''libX11'' requires header files in ''xorg-proto''. However, ''libX11'' can still be used without ''xorg-proto'' installed, so <var>RDEPEND</var> is not really correct. An alternative is to specify ''xorg-proto'' in every single ebuild linking against ''libX11'' directly or indirectly.
:''Note:'' This has also been suggested under the name [https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_db4986470a316a3653bfecd593d5007b.xml CDEPEND] (for "compile-against depend") previously.

;<var>FDEPEND</var>
:''Fetch dependencies''; {{Bug|481434}}. If implemented, it will be used to specify the dependencies necessary for the <code>src_fetch()</code> phase (e.g. a particular VCS). Thus, the package manager will be required to delay the execution of that phase until all fetch dependencies have been satisfied.
:'''Alternative solution:''' put fetch dependencies in <var>DEPEND</var>, and request <code>src_fetch()</code> implementation to check whether the tool requirements are satisfied already. Allow the package manager to execute <code>src_fetch()</code> without satisfying the dependencies and if it fails, re-try when the dependencies are satisfied.

;<var>IDEPEND</var>
:''Install-time dependencies''. Tools required for <code>pkg_*</code> phases; useful when binary a package is being installed and thus ''DEPEND'' does not fit.
:Note: this type would probably need to be split between CBUILD & CHOST dependencies.

;<var>LDEPEND</var>
:''Library dependencies''. Packages providing a library that is linked to, the first dependency type listed for BSD ports, cf: [http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/makefile-depend.html LIB_DEPENDS], which portage descends from. These would automatically be considered both <var>DEPEND</var> and <var>RDEPEND</var>, but soname changes would be tracked, and this would provide better data for both embedded and normal builds, eg: for <code>--preserved-rebuild</code>.

;<var>SDEPEND</var>
:''Suggested dependencies''; {{Bug|327701}}. A way of providing suggestions to install additional packages which can provide additional features to the package in question.

;<var>TDEPEND</var>
:''Test dependencies''; {{Bug|541938}}. Additional dependencies needed for the <code>src_test()</code> phase.
:Note: this type would probably need to be split between CBUILD & CHOST dependencies.

== Listing of suggested 'longer' names ==

If we decide to switch to a more meaningful dependency variable names, here are some ideas:

* <var>BADEPEND</var> -> BUILD_AGAINST_DEPEND
* <var>BDEPEND</var> -> BUILD_DEPEND
* <var>FDEPEND</var> -> FETCH_DEPEND
* <var>HDEPEND</var> -> HOST_DEPEND (HOST_BUILD_DEPEND?)
* <var>IDEPEND</var> -> INSTALL_DEPEND (PKG_DEPEND?)
* <var>LDEPEND</var> -> LIB_DEPEND (LINK_DEPEND?)
* <var>PDEPEND</var> -> POST_DEPEND
* <var>RDEPEND</var> -> RUN_DEPEND (RUNTIME_DEPEND?)
* <var>SDEPEND</var> -> SUGGESTED_DEPEND
* ...
