FDEPEND
:''Fetch dependencies''; {{Bug|182028}}. If implemented, it will be used to specify the dependencies necessary for the ''pkg_fetch()'' phase (e.g. a particular VCS). Thus, the package manager will be required to delay the execution of that phase until all fetch dependencies have been satisfied.
:'''Alternative solution:''' put fetch dependencies in ''DEPEND'', and request ''src_fetch()'' implementation to check whether the tool requirements are satisfied already. Allow the package manager to execute ''src_fetch()'' without satisfying the dependencies and if it fails, re-try when the dependencies are satisfied.
