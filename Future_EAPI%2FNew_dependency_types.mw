This page provides a summary of new dependency types requested for various features.

== The types ==

<!-- please keep the list sorted lexically -->

BADEPEND
:''Build-against dependencies''; {{Bug|392239}}. It would be used to inject additional ''DEPEND'' into a package being built against the package in question.
:'''Use case''': xorg packages, where e.g. building against ''libX11'' requires header files in ''xproto''. However, ''libX11'' can still be used without ''xproto'' installed, so ''RDEPEND'' is not really correct. An alternative is to specify ''xproto'' in every single ebuild linking against ''libX11'' directly or indirectly.

FDEPEND
:''Fetch dependencies''; {{Bug|182028}}. If implemented, it will be used to specify the dependencies necessary for the ''pkg_fetch()'' phase (e.g. a particular VCS). Thus, the package manager will be required to delay the execution of that phase until all fetch dependencies have been satisfied.
:'''Alternative solution:''' put fetch dependencies in ''DEPEND'', and request ''src_fetch()'' implementation to check whether the tool requirements are satisfied already. Allow the package manager to execute ''src_fetch()'' without satisfying the dependencies and if it fails, re-try when the dependencies are satisfied.

HDEPEND
:''Host dependencies''; {{Bug|317337}}. These will be required to be installed on the host machine when cross-compiling.

IDEPEND
:''Install-time dependencies''. Tools required for ''pkg_*'' phases; useful when binary a package is being installed and thus ''DEPEND'' does not fit.

LDEPEND
:''Library dependencies''. Packages providing a library that is linked to, the first dependency type listed for BSD ports, cf: [http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/makefile-depend.html LIB_DEPENDS], which portage descends from. These would automatically be considered both HDEPEND (or equivalently DEPEND for earlier EAPIs) and RDEPEND, but soname changes would be tracked, and this would provide better data for both embedded and normal builds, eg: for --preserved-rebuild.

SDEPEND
:''Suggested dependencies''; {{Bug|327701}}. A way of providing suggestions to install additional packages which can provide additional features to the package in question.

== Alternative: longer (more meaningful) dependency names ==

If the main reason for implementing ''DEPENDENCIES'' would be that dependency types are hard to remember, we may decide to replace them with longer names.

* BADEPEND -> BUILD_AGAINST_DEPEND
* BDEPEND -> BUILD_DEPEND
* FDEPEND -> FETCH_DEPEND
* HDEPEND -> HOST_DEPEND (HOST_BUILD_DEPEND?)
* IDEPEND -> INSTALL_DEPEND (PKG_DEPEND?)
* LDEPEND -> LIB_DEPEND (LINK_DEPEND?)
* PDEPEND -> POST_DEPEND
* RDEPEND -> RUN_DEPEND (RUNTIME_DEPEND?)
* SDEPEND -> SUGGESTED_DEPEND
* ...
