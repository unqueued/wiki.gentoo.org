Having trouble with {{Package|sys-apps/systemd}} being pulled in your emerges for no apparent reason? Read this article in order to find out how to resolve this problem.

== Why is systemd pulled in? ==
Most packages depending on systemd actually depend on systemd '''''or''''' OpenRC '''''or''''' some other init system. If no other init system is installed Portage will attempt to install the first in the list, which, in most cases, will be systemd.

This is perfectly normal behavior; Portage cannot magically guess which init system the user prefers. In order to help Portage understand that the users have preferences a USE flag can be defined to describe user preferences directly. That is the magic of the USE flag system.

== Permanently blocking systemd ==
=== systemd USE flag ===
Add <code>-systemd</code> to the system's '''USE''' variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.

=== Mask systemd and udev ===
In order to explicitly inform Portage to ''never'' install systemd, a mask file will need to be created. Masks can be created a two different ways. Either create a '''''FOLDER''''' called {{Path|package.mask}} in {{Path|/etc/portage}} then create individual text files containing lists of packages to be masked '''''OR''''' create a '''''FILE''''' called {{Path|package.mask}} and organize it all in one big file. Portage will be happy with either method. The choice is left up to the system administrator. Why two ways? Well, it would appear two methods continue to exist for organizational purposes. Some users like having everything defined in one file, while other users like having each set of packages masked in separate folders.

{{FileBox|title=package.mask FOLDER example|filename=/etc/portage/package.mask/systemd|1=
sys-apps/systemd
sys-fs/udev
}}

'''''OR'''''

{{FileBox|title=package.mask FILE example|filename=/etc/portage/package.mask|1=
sys-apps/systemd
sys-fs/udev
}}

Masking udev will not result in a broken system; Portage is smart enough to automatically replace udev by {{Package|sys-fs/eudev}}: the systemd-free fork of udev.

== Troubleshooting ==
===Packages requiring systemd===
Some packages have systemd as a non-optional dependency, if systemd is masked, you won't be able to install them

Either stop using such packages, switch to systemd or use some systemd emulator/wrapper/whatever

===I didn't notice portage installing systemd, am I using systemd now ?===
Portage does '''not''' activate systemd when installing it, if '''you''' do not activate systemd, you will remain on openrc (or whatever init you are currently using)

To remove systemd, follow the steps above and update @world, or remove it manually:
{{Emerge|systemd|params+=--unmerge}}
