Having trouble with systemd being pulled in your emerges for no apparent reason ?<br/>

==Why is systemd pulled in ?==
Most packages depending on systemd actually depend on ''systemd or X or Y''.<br/>
If you have none of those, emerge tries to install the first in the list: systemd<br/>
This is perfectly normal behavior, emerge ''cannot'' magically guess that you would prefer X or Y

==Permanently blocking systemd==
===systemd USE flag===
Add "-systemd" to your USE in /etc/portage/make.conf

===Mask systemd and udev===
{{file|/etc/portage/package.mask/systemd||<pre>
sys-apps/systemd
sys-fs/udev
</pre>
}}

Don't worry about blocking udev, it will automatically be replaced by eudev, the systemd-free fork of udev

==Troubleshooting==
Some packages do need systemd or udev specifically, masking systemd and udev will then prevent you from installing or upgrading these packages
