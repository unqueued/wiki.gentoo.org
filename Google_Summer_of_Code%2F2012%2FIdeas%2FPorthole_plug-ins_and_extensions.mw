|Porthole plug-ins and extensions|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 

Porthole is a GTK+-based frontend to Portage. This project would enable Porthole to improve its ability to manage remote computers, gather and report package statistics, and more. The work would encompass creating:

* A basic python based control interface API for linking to remote computers and groups of computers to gather information about installed packages, and install/update those using portage and/or pkgcore as remote backends.  One possible means of making those connections is by using [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/dev-python/pyro dev-python/pyro]. 
* Extending the work started in the public_api branch of portage to include running emerge via the public api.
* Create a simple cli for gathering/reporting update info for #1
* Create a porthole plug-in for connecting to the control interface, displaying the info in portholes views and and dispatching desired actions to the remotes via the control interface.
