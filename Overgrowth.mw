Overgrowth is a third person, 3D, fast paced, cross-platform action computer game developed by Wolfire Games. It has been in development since September 17, 2008<ref>http://blog.wolfire.com/2008/09/announcing-overgrowth/</ref>.

== Installation ==

At this point, since the game is currently in development, the install requirements might change. Hopefully this wiki page will reflect package requirements accordingly. At minimum the following packages are required for Overgrowth to run properly:

{{Emerge|params+=--verbose|gnome-base/gconf media-libs/freeimage media-libs/freealut media-libs/libpng}}

== Configuration ==

=== User groups ===

Make sure the users that will be running the game have the proper group permissions. Substitute <code><username></code> in the command below for each user that will require permission to play Overgrowth:

{{RootCmd
|gpasswd -a <username> audio
|gpasswd -a <username> video
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== S3TC support ===

If the game display a white box during the loading screen it might be because S3TC support is missing. This is fixable by installing the {{Package|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}} package:

{{Note|Installing the {{Package|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}} package is no longer necessary since the S3TC patent expired on October 2, 2017. S3TC support is now enabled by default with Mesa 17.3<ref>Matt Turner.
