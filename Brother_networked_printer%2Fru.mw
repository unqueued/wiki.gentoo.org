== Предварительные требования ==

=== cups ===

Убедитесь, что {{Package|net-print/cups}} установлен:

{{Emerge|net-print/cups}}

The cups service must be started before the driver(s) can be installed.

===== OpenRC =====

If OpenRC is used, then the following command can be issued to start the ''cups'' service.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/cupsd start}}  

To have it started automatically at boot time, use {{c|rc-update}}:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add cupsd default}}

===== Systemd  =====

If systemd is used, then the following command can be issued to start the ''cups'' service.

{{RootCmd|systemctl start cups.service}}  

To have it started automatically at boot time, invoke the following:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable cups.service}}

== Установка драйверов ==

=== Preferred: Using overlay drivers ===

If the printer is supported by an ebuild in [https://github.com/stefan-langenmaier/brother-overlay/tree/master/ brother-overlay] or some [http://gpo.zugaina.org/Search?search=brother other overlay], then please use it, as it usually contains all the prerequisites mentioned here. It would allow to skip the section "Alternative: rpm installation".

To enable an [[Overlay|overlay]], create the proper [[:/etc/portage/repos.conf|{{Path|repos.conf}}]] file and {{c|emaint sync}} it as shown here for '''brother-overlay''':

{{:/etc/portage/repos.conf/brother-overlay.conf/ru}}

{{RootCmd|emaint sync -r brother-overlay && eix-update}}

For using <code>sync-type = git</code> the package {{Package|dev-vcs/git}} needs to be installed.  Alternatively, [[layman#Adding_custom_overlays|layman]] can be used for adding the overlay.

From the overlay install the driver using {{c|emerge}} as shown here for Brother's Generic LPR and CUPSwrapper printer driver from [https://github.com/stefan-langenmaier/brother-overlay/tree/master/ brother-overlay].

{{Emerge|net-print/brother-genml1-bin}}

[https://github.com/stefan-langenmaier/brother-overlay/tree/master/net-print/brother-genml1-bin brother-genml1-bin] contains the Generic printer drivers as offered on [http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadlist.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=hll2340dw_us_eu_as&os=127 support.brother.com] for a wide range of compatible models (click the ''Compatible Model'' link on [http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadend.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=hll2340dw_us_eu_as&os=127&dlid=dlf101124_000&flang=4&type3=10034#pane3 BrGenML1 Compatible Models]): 
* Generic LPR printer driver (rpm package)
* Generic CUPSwrapper printer driver (rpm package)

The ppd file installed is {{Path|brother-BrGenML1-cups-en.ppd}} and the ''make and model'' is ''Brother BrGenML1 for CUPS''.

{{Cmd|/usr/sbin/lpinfo -m {{!}} grep -i brother|output=<pre>
brother-BrGenML1-cups-en.ppd Brother BrGenML1 for CUPS
</pre>}}

=== Alternative: rpm installation ===

As the drivers are available from Brother in the form of an {{Path|.rpm}} file, the {{Package|app-arch/rpm}} package needs to be installed.

{{Emerge|app-arch/rpm}}

==== Missing directories ====

Please create these directories up front; it will save a lot of trouble later:

{{RootCmd| mkdir -p /var/spool/lpd}}
{{RootCmd| mkdir -p /usr/lib64/cups/filter}}

==== Downloading the driver from Brother ====

The drivers for Brother printers are available at [http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/index.html Brother solutions'] web page.

Search for the correct model name by following the directions given by the pages.

After having chosen the right model, four drivers will be presented for download. Please download the two ones ending in {{Path|.rpm}} for ''LPR driver'' and ''cupswrapper driver''.

==== Установка драйверов ====

Installing the drivers may be a multiple-step process as some needed directories may appear missing on the system.

To install a driver change to the directory where the downloaded {{Path|.rpm}} files are located.

Next, issue the following command to see the filenames:

{{RootCmd|ls -a |output=<pre>
.  ..  dcp750cwcupswrapper-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm  dcp750cwlpr-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm
</pre>}}

Of course the driver names may change according to the model's name. The output of the previous command can be used to copy and paste the filenames in the rpm command to avoid typos when entering them.

First install the LPR driver.

{{RootCmd|rpm -i --nodeps dcp750cwlpr-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm}}

The installation may give some warnings, telling that some directories are missing. In this case, add the missing directories by hand and re-install the driver with this command:

{{RootCmd|rpm -i --nodeps --replacepkgs dcp750cwlpr-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm}}

Next install the ''cupswrapper'' driver  the same way:

{{RootCmd|rpm -i --nodeps dcp750cwcupswrapper-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm}}

Again, the installation may give some warnings, telling that some directories are missing. Try to add the missing directories by hand and re-install the driver with this command:

{{RootCmd|rpm -i --nodeps --replacepkgs dcp750cwcupswrapper-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm}}

{{Note|Do not forget the --replacepkgs option to force the re-installation of all the necessary files.}}

==== Copying the filter at the right place ====

Copy the filter to the right place with the following command:

{{Note| Have a look at the feedback table at the top of this page to know more about the filter's name.}}

{{RootCmd|cp /usr/lib64/cups/filter/brlpdwrapperdcp750cw /usr/libexec/cups/filter/}}

== Установка принтера ==

=== Подключение принтера к сети ===

Connect the printer to the network as described in the network section of the printer model's [http://support.brother.com/g/b/manuallist.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=hll2340dw_us_eu_as&flang=English&type3=10014&type2=5 Online User Guide]. From this step, the printer's network address can be obtained which is needed for CUPS in the next step.  When pointing the browser to the printer's network address it will go to the printer's user interface.

File:Myhomeprinter.png
</gallery>

=== Networked printer detection ===

CUPS is capable of automatically detecting networked printers. In case it does not work it might be blocked by a firewall. As a workaround, temporarily connect the printer to the computer.

=== Use CUPS' web interface to install the printer ===

Using CUPS' web interface [http://localhost:631/admin http://localhost:631/admin] is quite self-explanatory. The ''Add Printer'' button will list the networked printer(s) starting at the ''Discovered Network Printers'' line.

=== Use command line to install the printer ===

{{:Printing/lpinfo}}

Add the printer with {{c|lpadmin}} using device uri and ppd file:

{{RootCmd|lpadmin -p Brother_HL-L2340DW -E -v lpd://BRW67890ABCDEF/BINARY_P1 -m brother-BrGenML1-cups-en.ppd}}

For further options see {{c|man 8 lpadmin}}.

Check the setup with {{c|lpstat}}:

{{Cmd|lpstat -d -l -t|output=<pre>

</pre>}}

== Установка сканера ==

=== Предварительные требования ===

Make sure the {{Package|media-gfx/sane-backends}} package is installed in order to install the driver for the scanner. As most users will use {{c|xsane}} to scan a document, just emerge it. The {{Package|media-gfx/sane-backends}} package will be pulled in as a dependency.

{{Emerge|media-gfx/xsane}}

=== Установка драйвера ===

Download the driver from the [http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_scn.html Brother Solutions]'s download page for the scanner.

{{Important|Pay attention to the family the printer belongs to. Depending on the family, the right brscan will need to be selected (brscan, brscan2, brscan3 or brscan4) as well as the right architecture (32 bits or 64 bits depending on the system installation).}}

Change to the directory where the downloaded drivers are, and run the following command:

{{RootCmd|ls -a}}

This will show the file names of the downloaded files, allowing for easy copy/paste for the next commands.

Install the drivers using {{c|rpm}}:

{{RootCmd|rpm -i --nodeps brscan2-0.2.5-1.x86_64.rpm}}

{{Note|If xsane was not installed yet, install it, then add <code>--replacepkgs</code> as an option to the previous command to reinstall the driver.}}

===Configuring the scanner for network access===

{{Note|This step can be skipped if only local scanning via USB is needed. The necessary drivers are already installed through the brscan RPM package.}}

Once the driver is correctly installed, use the following command:

{{RootCmd|brsaneconfig2 -a name{{=}}monScanner model{{=}}DCP-750CW ip{{=}}192.168.1.13}}

{{Note| ''brsaneconfig2'' should be replaced with the command corresponding to the printer's family (see above), ''monScanner'' with any name of personal choice, and ''DCP-750CW'' with the printer's model name.}}

Now check everything is correctly installed:

{{RootCmd|brsaneconfig2 -q {{!}} grep monScanner|output=<pre>
  0 monScanner          "DCP-750CW"         I:192.168.1.13</pre>}}

{{Note|Replace ''monScanner'' with the name chosen above.}}

Congratulation! The scanner is now ready for use!

== Устранение проблем ==

=== Generic LPR printer driver on amd64 ===

The [http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadlist.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=hll2340dw_us_eu_as&os=127 printer driver] uses statically compiled x86 binaries. To be able to execute them the kernel needs to have the following configuration enabled: IA32_EMULATION

=== Text shifted up ===

Sometimes it happens that the text is shifted up toward the upper border of the page.

To correct this, enter the following command:

{{RootCmd| brprintconf_dcp750cw -pt A4}}

=== Scanner not detected ===

It may happen that, when xsane is launched, the scanner is not detected. This is probably due to a too recent version of libusb. In order to solve this, it might be necessary to install {{Package|dev-libs/libusb-compat}}. It was also necessary to get DCP-1610WE working over the network!

{{Emerge|dev-libs/libusb-compat}}
