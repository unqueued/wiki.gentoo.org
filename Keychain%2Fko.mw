이 문서는 키 모음 프로그램에서 SSH 키 공유 방식을 설명합니다. 이 글에서는 독자 여러분이 기본적인 공용키 암호화 지식을 갖추었다고 가정합니다.

== 배경 ==

=== 손 아귀에 쥐어진 문제 ===

모든 시스템에 매번 로그인 할 때마다 암호를 입력하는 과정은 불편하며, 게다가 수많은 시스템을 관리할 경우 특히 그렇습니다. 일부 관리자는 스크립트 또는 크론 작업을 ssh 연결 과정을 활용하여 편하게 처리하려 합니다. 각각의 방법에 이 문제에 대한 해결책이 있으며 공용키 인증으로 시작합니다. 

=== 공용키 인증은 어떻게 동작할까? ===

클라이언트가 서버의 ssh 데몬에 연결하려 한다고 가정해보겠습니다. 클라이언트는 우선 키 쌍을 만들어 서버에 공용 키를 제공합니다. 그 다음 클라이언트가 연결을 시도할 때마다 서버에서는 공용 키로 암호화한 정보를 던져줍니다. 개인 키에 따른 홀더(클라이언트)만이 이 정보를 해독할 수 있으므로, 올바른 응답을 해야만 인증을 성공적으로 처리할 수 있습니다. 

== 공용키 인증 사용법 ==

=== Generating a key pair ===

The first step is to create a key pair. To do this, use the <tt>ssh-keygen</tt> command: 

{{Cmd|ssh-keygen}}

Accept the default values, and make sure to enter a strong passphrase.

{{Warning|Be sure to choose a strong passphrase, especially if this key is used for root logons!}}

After the generation has ended a private key should be located at {{Path|~/.ssh/id_rsa}} and a public key in {{Path|~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub}}. The public key is now ready to be copied to the remote host.

=== Preparing the server ===

The {{Path|~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub}} file needs to be copied over to the server running <tt>sshd</tt>. It has to be added to the {{Path|~/.ssh/authorized_keys}} file that belongs the connecting user on the remote server. After <tt>ssh</tt> access to the server has been granted by infrastructure personnel, the following steps can be used to setup automatic login using a public key on the remote server:

{{Cmd|scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub server_user@server:~/myhost.pub
|ssh server_user@server "cat ~/myhost.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
|ssh server_user@server "cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"}}

The output from that last line should show the contents of the {{Path|~/.ssh/authorized_keys}} file. Make sure the output looks correct.

=== Testing the setup ===

Theoretically, if all went well, and the <tt>sshd</tt> daemon on the server allows it (as this can be configured), <tt>ssh</tt> access without entering a password should now be possible on the server. The private key on the client will still need to be decrypted with the passphrase used previously, but this should not be confused with the password of the user account on the server.

{{Cmd|ssh <server_user>@<server>}}

It should have asked for a passphrase for {{Path|id_rsa}}, and then grant access via <tt>ssh</tt> as the user <code><server_user></code> on the server. If not, login as <code><server_user></code>, and verify that the contents of {{Path|~/.ssh/authorized_keys}} has each entry (which is a public key) on a single line. It is also a good idea to check the sshd configuration to make sure that it allows to use public key authorization when available.

At this point, readers might be thinking, "What's the point, I just replaced one password with another?!" Relax, the next section will show exactly how we can use this to only enter the passphrase once and re-use the (decrypted) key for multiple logins.

== Making public key authentication convenient ==

=== Typical key management with ssh-agent ===

The next step is to decrypt the private key(s) once, and gain the ability to ssh freely, without any passwords. That is exactly what the program <tt>ssh-agent</tt> is for. 

<tt>ssh-agent</tt> is usually started at the beginning of the X session, or from a shell startup script like {{Path|~/.bash_profile}}. It works by creating a unix-socket, and registering the appropriate environment variables so that all subsequent applications can take advantage of its services by connecting to that socket. Clearly, it only makes sense to start it in the parent process of an X session to use the set of decrypted private keys in all subsequent X applications. 

{{Cmd|eval `ssh-agent`}}

{{Note|This <tt>ssh-agent</tt> will keep keys decrypted until it is killed. To set a lifetime for the keys, use the <code>-t</code> argument as described in <tt>man ssh-agent</tt>.}}

When running <tt>ssh-agent</tt>, it should output the PID of the running ssh-agent, and also set a few environment variables, namely <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> and <code>SSH_AGENT_PID</code>. It should also automatically add {{Path|~/.ssh/id_rsa}} to it's collection and ask the user for the corresponding passphrase. If other private keys exist which need to be added to the running ssh-agent, use the <tt>ssh-add</tt> command: 

{{Cmd|ssh-add somekeyfile}}

Now for the magic. With the decrypted private key ready, ssh into a (public key configured) server without entering any passwords: 

{{Cmd|ssh server}}

In order to shut down ssh-agent (and as such require entry of the passphrase again later):

{{Cmd|ssh-agent -k}}

{{Note|It is possible to have multiple <tt>ssh-agent</tt> processes running, especially when configuring it initially took some effort and trials. These processes can be killed like any other process by running <tt>killall ssh-agent</tt>.}}

To get even more convenience from ssh-agent, proceed to the next section on using keychain. Be sure to kill the running ssh-agent as keychain will handle the <tt>ssh-agent</tt> sessions itself.

=== Squeezing the last drop of convenience out of ssh-agent ===

Keychain will allow to reuse an ssh-agent between logins, and optionally prompt for passphrases each time the user logs in. Let's emerge it first:

{{Emerge|keychain}}

Assuming that was successful, <tt>keychain</tt> can now be used. Add the following to the {{Path|~/.bash_profile}} file to enable it: 

{{CodeBox|title=Enabling keychain in .bash_profile|<pre>
keychain ~/.ssh/id_rsa
. ~/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh
. ~/.keychain/$HOSTNAME-sh-gpg
</pre>
}}

{{Note|More private keys can be added to the command line as desired. Also, to have it ask for passphrases each time a shell is spawned, add the <code>--clear</code> option.}}

{{Note|When not using bash, check the '''EXAMPLES''' section of <tt>man keychain</tt> for examples of use in other shells. The idea is to get those commands to run each time a shell is used.}}

Now test it. First make sure the ssh-agent processes from the previous section are killed, then start up a new shell, usually by just logging in, or spawning a new terminal. It should prompt for the password for each key specified on the command line. All shells opened after that point should reuse the ssh-agent, allowing to use passwordless ssh connections over and over. 

=== Using keychain with KDE ===

KDE users, instead of using {{Path|~/.bash_profile}}, can let KDE manage ssh-agent for them. In order to do so, edit {{Path|/etc/kde/startup/agent-startup.sh}}, which is read during KDE's startup, and {{Path|/etc/kde/shutdown/agent-shutdown.sh}}, which is executed during KDE's shutdown. Here is how one could edit those files: 

{{CodeBox|title=Editing /etc/kde/startup/agent-startup.sh|1=
if [ -x /usr/bin/ssh-agent ]; then
  eval "$(/usr/bin/ssh-agent -s)"
fi
}}

{{CodeBox|title=Editing /etc/kde/shutdown/agent-shutdown.sh|1=
if [ -n "${SSH_AGENT_PID}" ]; then
  eval "$(ssh-agent -k)"
fi}}

Now, all that has to be done is launch a terminal of choice, like Konsole, and load the right set of keys to use. For example: 

{{Cmd|keychain ~/.ssh/id_rsa}}

The keys will be remembered until the end of the KDE session (or until the ssh-agent process is killed manually).

== Concluding remarks ==

=== Security considerations ===

Of course, the use of ssh-agent may add a bit of insecurity to the system. If another user would gain access to a running shell, he could login to all of the servers without passwords. As a result, it is a risk to the servers, and users should be sure to consult the local security policy (if any). Be sure to take the appropriate measures to ensure the security of all sessions. 

=== Troubleshooting ===

Most of this should work pretty well, but if problems do come up, then the following items might be of assistance. 

* If connecting without <tt>ssh-agent</tt> does not seem to work, consider using ssh with the <code>-vvv</code> options to find out what's happening. Sometimes the server is not configured to use public key authentication, sometimes it is configured to ask for local passwords anyway! If that is the case, try using the <code>-o</code> option with <tt>ssh</tt>, or change the server's {{Path|sshd_config}}.
* If connecting with <tt>ssh-agent</tt> or <tt>keychain</tt> does not seem to work, then it may be that the current shell does not understand the commands used. Consult the man pages for ssh-agent and keychain for details on working with other shells.
