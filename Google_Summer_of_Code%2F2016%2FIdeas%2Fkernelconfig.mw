<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Consistently generate custom Linux kernel configurations from curated sources ([https://github.com/Calchan/kernelconfig on github]).

Compiling a kernel is easy, configuring it not so much. Unless you have the time and skill to follow kernel development, it is best to leave that to a team of specialists. But where to download up to date configurations? What to do if you need to do the same changes over and over with each new version? Enter kernelconfig. It will automatically download a base configuration matching the kernel you want to compile from a curated source of your choice (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Liquorix, etc...), customize it with a number of options which suit your taste and needs, apply macros to set a number of options in a smart way, and more.

kernelconfig is still in its infancy and needs a lot of love. The author has a lot of ideas to get you started, but yours are welcome too!
