== Finding an adapter ==
Browse to https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Special:RunQuery/Wireless_adapter_query . <br />
Find "Supported 802dot11 protocols:", enter abgn+ac .<br />
Find "Table query type:", select linux_support .<br />
Click "Run query" .<br />
Scroll down to find a table of known abgn+ac Wireless Adapters with chipset, pciid, and possible linux driver. The AC1200 adapters in the table will have RTL8812AU or BCM43526 chipsets. The other chipsets listed support other protocols.<br />

== Finding and installing a driver ==

Drivers for pcie connected Realtek 8723/8812/8821 adapters are in kernel-3.17.8 and later.
Driver 8812au for Realtek usb chipsets is available at https://github.com/gnab/rtl8812au . Download and extract the zip file, cd to the extracted directory (/path/to/rtl8812au-master). Ensure the AC1200 is not installed. Follow the instructions provided in README.md . Install the adapter. <br />
wl 6 is in portage as broadcomm-sta, but support of bcm4352 and bcm43526 is very unlikely. The BCM43526 is not in the supported device list at http://www.broadcom.com/docs/linux_sta/README_6.30.223.248.txt . Using ndiswrapper and 32 bit windows files may work. 64 bit windows files do not. As the BCM43526 adapters are usb2.0, 480 mbps, they should be unable to support the theoretical 867 mbps of the 5 ghz channels.<br />

== Notes ==

After the driver is installed, the five RTL8812UA adapters listed above can be hot swapped in Gentoo, but not in Windows.

In both Gentoo and Windows, the RTL8812AU driver will not install correctly if the usb adapter is in place before the software is installed.

The 8812ua driver may not install correctly unless the kernel configuration enables some of the builtin realtek wireless drivers (including those in staging) as modules. The need for this is under evaluation.<br />

The 8812ua driver will reject the nl80211 driver and require wext.

The Linksys WUSB6300 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wireless Adapter Windows 8 and 8.1 drivers fail. A simple working solution exists at  https://community.linksys.com/t5/Wireless-Adapters/WUSB6300-Windows-8-1-Wifi-problems/m-p/791422#M33288. Summarized: Control Panel/Device Manager/Network adapters/Linksys WUSB6300/Properties/Advanced/QoS Support/Value needs to be set to "Not Support QoS".
