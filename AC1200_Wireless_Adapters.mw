Browse to https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Special:RunQuery/Wireless_adapter_query . <br />
Find "Supported 802dot11 protocols:", enter abgn+ac .<br />
Find "Table query type:", select linux_support .<br />
Click "Run query" .<br />
Scroll down to find a table of known abgn+ac Wireless Adapters with chipset, pciid, and possible linux driver. The AC1200 adapters in the table will have RTL8812AU or BCM43526 chipsets. The other chipsets listed support other protocols.<br />

== Driver Locations ==

8812au is available at https://github.com/gnab/rtl8812au . Download and extract the zip file, cd to the extracted directory (/path/to/rtl8812au-master), follow the instructions provided in README.md .<br />
wl 6 is in portage as broadcomm-sta, but support of bcm4352 and bcm43526 is very unlikely. The BCM43526 is not in the supported device list at http://www.broadcom.com/docs/linux_sta/README_6.30.223.248.txt . Using ndiswrapper and windows files may work. As the BCM43526 adapters are usb2.0, 480 mbps, they should be unable to support the theoretical 867 mbps of the 5 ghz channels.<br />
