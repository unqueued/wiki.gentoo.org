== Discussion ==
As of February 2015, AC1200 adapters use either the Broadcom BCM43526 chipset or the Realtek RTL8812AU chipset.
Neither chipset has a driver in the kernel.
The Broadcom BCM43526 chipset has no known linux driver. An ndiswrapper ebuild exists in portage; google suggests some success with ndiswrapper.
The Realtek RTL8812AU chipset has a linux driver available at https://github.com/gnab/rtl8812au . Download and extract the zip file, cd to the extracted directory, follow the instructions provided in README.md . External module 8812ua will have been built and inserted as driver    
for the NIC.
