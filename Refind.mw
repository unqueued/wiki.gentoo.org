'''rEFInd''' is [[Article description::a boot manager for EFI and UEFI platforms]] forked from and successor to rEFIt. It provides a graphical interface for launching EFI-based operating systems and accessing EFI-based utilities.

{{Warning|Users of [[Project:AMD64/Multilib_layout#SYMLINK_LIB.3Dno_layout_.2817.1_profiles.29|'''SYMLINK_LIB{{=}}no layout''']] see {{bug|627744}} or use [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/sys-boot/refind/refind-0.11.2.ebuild version 0.11.2] or higher.}}

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

rEFInd has optional support for scanning several filesystems for EFI executables before loading the operating system. This allows to keep the kernels outside of the [[EFI System Partition]] (ESP) but needs the rEFInd built with the respective [[USE flag]]s enabled.

{{USEflag|package=sys-boot/refind}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|sys-boot/refind|output=<pre>rEFInd has been built and installed into ${EROOT%/}/usr/share/${P}
You will need to use the command 'refind-install' to install
the binaries into your EFI System Partition
</pre>}}

== ESP Installation ==
=== Installation with NVRAM modification ===

Once the rEFInd package has been emerged, a second step is needed to install the binaries to the ESP. If an ESP does not exist, one needs to be created. See [[EFI System Partition]]. It is advisable to set its [[EFI_System_Partition#Mount_point|mountpoint]] to {{path|/boot}}.

The rEFInd package comes with the {{c|refind-install}} command. Running it will
* Automount the ESP according to [[EFI_System_Partition#Mount_point|{{path|/etc/fstab}}]]
* Install its {{path|refind_x64.efi}} application and other stuff into the ESP
* Call [[efibootmgr]] to set itself as the default boot manager.

{{RootCmd|refind-install|output=<pre>ShimSource is none

Copied rEFInd binary files

Copying sample configuration file as refind.conf; edit this file to configure
rEFInd.

Installing it!
rEFInd has been set as the default boot manager.
Creating //boot/refind_linux.conf; edit it to adjust kernel options.

Installation has completed successfully.

{{Cmd|efibootmgr -v|output=<pre>Boot000x* rEFInd Boot Manager   HD(1,GPT,1729a003-cf0d-4bd4-88c9-cc24d8d418c4,0x800,0x2f000)/File(\EFI\refind\refind_x64.efi)</pre>}}

Boot000x* can vary depending on existing entries.

{{warning|If {{path|/boot}} cannot be found in [[EFI_System_Partition#Mount_point|{{path|/etc/fstab}}]], {{c|refind-install}} will default to using {{path|/boot/efi/EFI}} and even move an existing {{path|/boot/EFI}} to {{path|/boot/efi/EFI}}.}}

{{warning|It is important to manually [[Efibootmgr#EFI_vars|remount your efivarfs]] with rw option or rEFInd won't be able to set itself as the default boot manager, issuing an error message.
In order to do this, use the following command:
{{RootCmd|mount -o remount,rw -t efivarfs efivarfs /sys/firmware/efi/efivars}}}}

=== Installation to the EFI Default/Fallback path ===
You can install rEFInd to a disk using the default/fallback filename of {{path|EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi}}. Your computer's NVRAM entries will not be modified when installing in this way. Most EFI and UEFI firmware support a fallback EFI image to boot from if the configured EFI file cannot be found, and some will also override the configured boot selection if the fallback boot image is found. This can be used to boot into EFI mode when doing so otherwise is difficult.

{{RootCmd
|refind-install --usedefault /dev/sda
}}

Where {{Path|/dev/sda}} is your [[EFI System Partition]].
This isntallation method can be used as either a permanent setup to create a bootable USB flash drive or install rEFInd on a computer that tends to "forget" its NVRAM settings or as a temporary bootstrap to get the system to boot in EFI mode.

== Kernel management ==

rEFInd detects and displays an icon appropriate for the operating system kernel based on the directory it is in. To display a nice Gentoo logo, move the kernel (and initramfs if required) to {{Path|/boot/EFI/Gentoo}}.

{{RootCmd|mv /boot/vmlinuz-4.2.0-gentoo /boot/EFI/Gentoo/vmlinuz-4.9.16-gentoo.efi
|mv /boot/initramfs-4.2.0-gentoo /boot/EFI/Gentoo/initramfs-4.9.16-gentoo.img}}

Kernels and initramfs go into their EFI subdirectory:

{{Cmd|tree -L 3 /boot|output=<pre>/boot
├── EFI
│   ├── Gentoo
│   │   ├── vmlinuz-4.9.16-gentoo.efi
│   │   └── initramfs-4.9.16-gentoo.img
│   ├── refind
│   │   ├── icons
│   │   ├── keys
│   │   ├── refind.conf
│   │   └── refind_x64.efi
│   └── tools
└── refind_linux.conf
</pre>}}

Alternatively, kernels (and initramfs if in use) may be kept in {{path|/boot}}. As previously stated, when used with the appropriate filesystem driver, rEFInd can scan the root partition for suitable Linux kernels to boot.

{{Note|File names are important to rEFInd, especially for matching kernels with their initramfs. Follow the above naming convention for best results, though more detail can be found in the config file.}}

=== Different boot configurations ===

Also different boot configurations can be specified to appear as different menu options within the rEFInd menu. This is done by creating the file {{Path|/boot/EFI/gentoo/refind_linux.conf}} with a menu title and the matching cmdline options on each line.

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/EFI/gentoo/refind_linux.conf|1="Default"	"root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 ro quiet"
"Console"	"root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 ro quiet nox"
"Emergency"	"root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 ro 1"}}

The main selection screen for rEFInd will use the first option as the default option, however alternate boot entries can be accessed by highlighting your kernel and pressing {{Key|F2}}. You can also modify cmdline on-the-fly by pressing {{Key|F2}} on a menu item to open it in an editor. When ready, press {{Key|Enter}} to boot the kernel.

{{Note|The kernel cmdline options above are for example only - you will need to have your own options that allow your kernel to boot for your system.}}
