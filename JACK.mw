This article [[Article description::describes the setup of a playing sound with ''JACK'' ('''J'''ACK '''A'''udio '''C'''onnection '''K'''it).]]

JACK is a sound server where applications like [[mpv]] can connect to to play their sound.

== Installation ==

JACK uses [[ALSA]] for accessing the sound card hardware, be sure [[ALSA]] is working.

=== Software ===

First, emerge the sound server itself.

{{Emerge|media-sound/jack2}}

{{USEflag|package=media-sound/jack2}}

The global USE flag <code>[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/jack jack]</code> enables support for JACK in other packages, so they can submit sound to a JACK server:

{{RootCmd|euse -E jack}}

The {{c|euse}} command is part of {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}.

After setting this be sure to update the system so the changes take effect:

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Configuration ==

=== Sound Server ===

A good JACK configuration and control software is {{Package|media-sound/cadence}}.

{{Emerge|media-sound/cadence}}

=== Bridging ===

JACK can route sound which was sent to other sound systems like [[PulseAudio]] and [[ALSA]] through itself.
