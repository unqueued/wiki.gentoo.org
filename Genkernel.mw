'''genkernel''' is used to automate the build process of the [[kernel]] and [[initramfs]]. Some of the general features:
* configure the kernel sources
* build bzImage and copy to {{Path|/boot}}
* create initramfs and copy to {{Path|/boot}}
* create symlinks in {{Path|/boot}}
* add custom content to initramfs for encryption, splash images, extra modules etc.
* compress initramfs
* configure the [[bootloader]]

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel}}:
{{USEflag|package=sys-kernel/genkernel
|crypt++no
|cryptsetup++no
|ibm++no
|selinux++no
}}

{{Emerge|genkernel}}

== Configuration ==
The actual behavior of genkernel depends on  a large variety of flags that can be set/unset in the   {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} file. This file is very well documented but let's examine some of the most commonly used ones here. For a more complete explanation, please refer to the comments in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} itself or to the output of the <code>man genkernel</code> command.

=== Configuration flags ===
The configuration flags listed below  help you decide what features should be enabled or disabled in the kernel prior to compilation. You can even choose whether or not the configuration file created in the process should be saved. The following are the primary configuration flags:

{{Note|Some of the flags have a variant that triggers a converse behavior. They are figured as '''--[no]flag_name''', and the converse effect is shown in square brakets as in the following example:<br />
'''--[no]-menuconfig''': Activates [deactivates] ... }}<br />


:* '''--[no-]menuconfig''': Activates [ or deactivates] the <code>make menuconfig</code> command (which invokes un interactive configuration menu) before building the kernel.
:* '''--gconfig''': Provides a kernel configuration utility which depends on the GTK+ libraries. The advantage of this option is that most users find it easier and clearer to configure the kernel using this tool, since it relies on the X-windowing system. The disadvantage of this option is that you need the X-windowing system to use it, so it will not work on the command line.
:* '''--xconfig''': Provides a kernel configuration utility which depends on the QT libraries. The advantage of this option is that most users find it easier and clearer to configure the kernel using this tool, since it relies on the X-windowing system. The disadvantage of this option is that you need the X-windowing system to use it, so it will not work on the command line.
:* '''--[no-]save-config''': Saves [or does not save] the kernel configuration to a file in the /etc/kernels/ directory for later use.
