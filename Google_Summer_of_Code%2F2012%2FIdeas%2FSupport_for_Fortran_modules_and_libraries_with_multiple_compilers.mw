|Support for Fortran modules and libraries with multiple compilers|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Fortran modules and libraries are highly compiler dependent. Even minor version change in gfortran renders them incompatible. However, we are often forced to work with multiple compilers at the same time (e.g. scientific software development). The project aim is to create a Fortran framework that would allow to install concurrent versions of Fortran binaries in a PMS (Package Manager Specification)-aware fashion, along with a configuration module for eselect to rule them all.
