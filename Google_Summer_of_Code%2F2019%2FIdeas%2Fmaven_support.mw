<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Maven support for portage packages. Similar to the [https://fedora-java.github.io/howto/latest/#maven fedora support]. All artifacts must be built from source, constructing a local repository, the maven repository is forced to local repository, a complete eco-system of packages built from source.

The [https://fedora-java.github.io/xmvn/ xmvn] utility may be reused for the task as a wrapepr of maven.

As a prof of concept all existing maven based packages that exists in portage and hacked to use ant or any other transformation should use the new infrastructure.
