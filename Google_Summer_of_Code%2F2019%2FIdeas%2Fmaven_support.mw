{{GSoCIdea|X509 Trust Store|year=2019|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Currently, there is not centralized X.509 trust store in Gentoo to allow easy control of the various of cryptographic frameworks:
* OpenSSL
* NSS
* Java
* Probably Python and Go

Fedora has a [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/using-shared-system-certificates/ mechanism] of having `/etc/pki/anchors` to be source of truth and `update-ca-certificates` scripts to generate the various of framework specific structure, for example each JVM JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts is a synlink to a file at /etc which is generated by the script.

We should have a similar mechanism in Gentoo, as these certificates are system width configuration and not part of a specific package. However, we should have this smarter, so that packages can extend support by using drop-in scriptlet.
