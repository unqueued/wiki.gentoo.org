i'm working on a lenovo 730 15" 

this article wants to be a howto. feel free to edit.

intel gen8 i7
16gb ram
nvidia gforce 1050
512GB nvm-e 

following the sakaki directions for a luks over lvm install. i was not able to get the drives to be recognized when sata mode was set to RST in the bios. it would be nice that one didn't have to switch RST - AHCI in bios to get the stock windows installation to boot back and forth. so far, i have gnome3 on wayland running.

currently trying to get the touch pad to work. the synaptics device is the fingerprint reader and not the touchpad. 
by all accounts on the lenovo yoga 720, the touchpad a elan_i2c device. 

i have tried the kernel patches recommended for the yoga 720 

drivers/input/mouse/elan_i2c_core.c 
+1267         { "ELAN0651", 0 },

the intel_llps_pci.c edits were already comitted in 4.14.65

but still joy in the /dev/input/

more to come
