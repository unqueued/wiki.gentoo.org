qutebrowser is a web browser with [https://qutebrowser.org/img/cheatsheet-big.png vim-style key bindings] based off the QtWebKit (or the QtWebEngine in its latest release). It is lightweight using a minimal GUI and is inspired by software such as [http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator/ Vimperator] and [https://portix.bitbucket.io/dwb/ dwb]. It uses [https://duckduckgo.com/ DuckDuckGo] as the default search engine.

Qutebrowser was developed by Florian Bruhin, for which he received a CH Open Source award in 2016.
