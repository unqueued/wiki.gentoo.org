Multilib is one of the solutions allowing users to run applications built for various ABIs of the same architecture. The most common use of multilib is to run 32-bit applications on amd64.

The multilib systems use separate library directories for non-native ABIs. This allows having the same library installed in variants for each ABI, as necessary to satisfy the dependencies of programs built for the ABI in question.

== multilib library providers in Gentoo ==
There are currently three ways of providing multilib libraries in Gentoo:

* using emul-linux-x86 packages (32-bit libraries for amd64 only),
* using the eclasses provided by the [[gx86-multilib]] project,
* using the [[multilib-portage]] fork.

== Comparison of multilib approaches ==
