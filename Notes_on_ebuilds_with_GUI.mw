When this wiki page was started (2017-11-13), there was a lot confusion about how to write clean ebuilds for desktop applications.
As result, there are many ebuilds which use obsolete eclasses, or even worse do not install, update and remove the icons and menus.
The eclasses are hardly documented and the documentation has mistakes. Many for loops for icons miss the definition of the local variable.

{{Note|This page is still '''work in progress'''. It would be nice, if we could extract a howto wiki page from it afterwards and improve the documentation of the eclasses.}}

== Eclasses ==

=== xdg.eclass ===

eclass reference: {{Eclass|xdg}}

* xdg inherits xdg-utils

=== xdg-utils.eclass ===

eclass reference: {{Eclass|xdg-utils}}

=== gnome2.eclass ===

eclass reference: {{Eclass|gnome2}}

=== gnome2-utils.eclass ===

eclass reference: {{Eclass|gnome2-utils}}

=== kde5.eclass ===

eclass reference: {{Eclass|kde5}}

* kde5_pkg_preinst Function storing icon caches 

* kde5_pkg_postinst Function to rebuild the KDE System Configuration Cache after an application has been installed. 

* kde5_pkg_postrm Function to rebuild the KDE System Configuration Cache after an application has been removed.

=== fdo-mime.eclass (obsolete) ===

eclass reference: {{Eclass|fdo-mime}}

fdo-mime is obsolete since 2017-06-19 see mail "[gentoo-dev] [PATCH] fdo-mime.eclass: Mark the eclass as deprecated". 

See also {{Bug|621914}}.

* '''Packages''' which are still using the fdo-mime https://qa-reports.gentoo.org/output/eclass-usage/fdo-mime.txt
* '''Ebuilds''' which are still using the fdo-mime '''sorted by Maintainer or Package''' http://gentoo.levelnine.at/simplechecks/fdo-mime-check/

== What repoman QA can detect ==

{{CodeBox|1=
 * QA Notice: .desktop files with MimeType= were found installed
 * but desktop mimeinfo cache has not been updated:
 *   /usr/share/applications/SciTE.desktop
 * Please make sure to call xdg_desktop_database_update()
 * in pkg_postinst() and pkg_postrm() phases of appropriate pkgs.
}}

== Code examples to create icons ==

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
src_install() {
    local i
    for i in 16x16 22x22 32x32 48x48 64x64 128x128; do
        newicon -s ${i} utilities/${PN}${i}.png ${PN}.png
    done
}
}}

== .desktop files ==

* [[.desktop_files]]

== brainstorming section (delete later, when merged in the text) ==

This page provides a summary of various files whose installation should be accompanied by appropriate postinst/postrm trigger calls.

* *1) Not needed in general, but still useful to use in phase defining eclasses, like gnome2.eclass.

* Needs to be updated since some savelists are not needed
* what about fonts?

=== How other distributions handle this ===
* Arch Linux uses trigger, which detect the folder activity automatic and update on demand: https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/alpm-hooks.5.html
* Debian (for example update-desktop-database) https://wiki.debian.org/DpkgTriggers

=== Working principle of a trigger in bash ===

{{CodeBox|lang=bash|1=
while read type file; do
	case "${file}" in
		/usr/share/ca-certificates/*.crt)
			update-ca-certificates
			break
		;;
	esac
done < "${TEMP}/files"
}}
