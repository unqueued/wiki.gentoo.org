== Reasoning ==
When this wiki page was started (2017-11-13), there was a lot confusion about how to write clean ebuilds for desktop applications.
As result, there are many ebuilds which use obsolete eclasses, or even worse do not install, update and remove the icons and menus.
The eclasses are hardly documented and the documentation has mistakes. Many for loops for icons miss the definition of the local variable.

This page is still work in progress. It would be nice, if we could extract a howto wiki page from it afterwards and improve the documentation of the eclasses.

== Eclasses ==

=== xdg.eclass ===
xdg inherits xdg-utils

=== xdg-utils.eclass ===

=== gnome2-utils.eclass ===

=== fdo-mime.eclass (obsolete) ===
fdo-mime is obsolete since 2017-06-19 see mail "[gentoo-dev] [PATCH] fdo-mime.eclass: Mark the eclass as deprecated".

== Code examples to create icons ==
<code>
src_install() {
    local i
    for i in 16x16 22x22 32x32 48x48 64x64 128x128; do
        newicon -s ${i} utilities/${PN}${i}.png ${PN}.png
    done
}
