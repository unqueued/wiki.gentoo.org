= Introduction =

Snapper is a snapshot utility initially developed by Suse.

= Rollback =

Snapper has function called 'rollback' to switch your current mounted btrfs subvolume to an older subvolume. This feature requires a btrfs file system.

To work properly the rollback feature needs an entry in the [[fstab]]. Assuming that /dev/sda1 contains your btrfs filesystem you are working on, you need to add.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
/dev/sda1            /.snapshots     btrfs           subvol=.snapshots       0 0
}}

When snapper is initialized, this fstab entry is not needed, because the subvolume "/.snapshots" is created at the root subvolume and therefore accessible from the root subvolume from the directory /.snapshots.
But if you do your first rollback, and you boot into your snapshot subvolume, then the /.snapshots directory is empty. So snapper will not work any more. In my case it printed an input outpur error to the console.
