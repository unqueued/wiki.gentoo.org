'''A torrent is a group of P2P clients participating in a coordinated up- and downloading of one or more files. The structure of this torrent group as well as the metadata involved with the torrent is defined by the tracker file.'''

Clients that want to participate in the torrent connect to the tracker to find out from who to download files. Recent versions of this method also support ''peer exchange'' so that clients can communicate to other clients who participates without the need for registering this in the tracker.
