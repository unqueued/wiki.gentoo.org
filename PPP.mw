'''PPP''' ('''P'''oint-to-'''P'''oint '''P'''rotocol) is commonly used in establishing a direct connection between two networking nodes. It can provide connection authentication, transmission encryption, and compression.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Network device support  --->
        <*>   PPP (point-to-point protocol) support
        <*>     PPP support for async serial ports
        <*>     PPP Deflate compression
        Select more options, see table below

=== Software ===
Portage knows the global USE flag ''ppp'' for enabling support for PPP in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|net-dialup/ppp}} automatically:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||
USE{{=}}"... ppp ..."
}}
The USE flags of ppp are:
{{USEflag|package=net-dialup/ppp
|activefilter
|atm
|dhcp
|eap-tls
|gtk+yes
|ipv6+yes
|pam+yes
|radius
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
