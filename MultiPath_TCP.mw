MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) is an effort towards enabling the simultaneous use of several IP-addresses/interfaces by a modification of TCP that presents a regular TCP interface to applications, while in fact spreading data across several subflows. Benefits of this include '''better resource utilization''', '''better throughput''' and '''smoother reaction to failures'''.

In Gentoo, you can use mptcp-sources (patched official gentoo-sources with mptcp support).
{{RootCmd|layman -a ixit}}
{{Emerge| mptcp-sources}}
Now, you need [[Kernel/Configuration|configure kernel]]
{{Kernel||<pre>
Networking support (NET [=y])
  Networking options
    TCP/IP networking (INET [=y])
      [*]   IP: advanced router
        [*]     IP: policy routing
      [ ]   IP: TCP syncookie support
      [ ]   TCP: MD5 Signature Option support (RFC2385)
      [*]   MPTCP protocol
</pre>}}
{{Note| SYN cookies and MD5_SIG are currently disabled because our implementation does not yet support them. The protocol specification itself has no limitations on these features. }}
If you want to use the Coupled Congestion Control, that guarantees fairness across a shared bottleneck, you have to enable
{{Kernel||<pre>
Networking support (NET [=y])
  Networking options
    TCP/IP networking (INET [=y])
      [*]   TCP: advanced congestion control  --->
        <*>   MPTCP COUPLED CONGESTION CONTROL
        <*>   MPTCP Opportunistic Linked Increase
</pre>}}
