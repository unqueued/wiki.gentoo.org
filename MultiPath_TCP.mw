MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) is an effort towards enabling the simultaneous use of several IP-addresses/interfaces by a modification of TCP that presents a regular TCP interface to applications, while in fact spreading data across several subflows. Benefits of this include better resource utilization, better throughput and smoother reaction to failures.

== Installation ==

Get sources from mptcp or manually patch the Linux kernel.

=== Kernel ===

Now, configure the kernel with the following option:

{{KernelBox|1=
Networking support (NET [=y])
  Networking options
    TCP/IP networking (INET [=y])
      [*]   IP: advanced router
        [*]     IP: policy routing
      [*]   MPTCP protocol
      [*]     MPTCP: advanced path-manager control  --->
        <*>   MPTCP Full-Mesh Path-Manager
}}

Using Coupled Congestion Control will guarantee fairness across a shared bottleneck, enable it:

{{KernelBox|1=
Networking support (NET [=y])
  Networking options
    TCP/IP networking (INET [=y])
      [*]   TCP: advanced congestion control  --->
        <*>   MPTCP COUPLED CONGESTION CONTROL
        <*>   MPTCP Opportunistic Linked Increase
}}
