MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) is an effort towards enabling the simultaneous use of several IP-addresses/interfaces by a modification of TCP that presents a regular TCP interface to applications, while in fact spreading data across several subflows. Benefits of this include '''better resource utilization''', '''better throughput''' and '''smoother reaction to failures'''.

In Gentoo, you can use hybrid-sources with mptcp USE (official gentoo-sources with patches configurable by USE flags).
{{RootCmd|layman -a ixit}}
{{Emerge| hybrid-sources}}
Now, you need [[Kernel/Configuration|configure kernel]]
{{Kernel||<pre>
Networking support (NET [=y])
  Networking options
    TCP/IP networking (INET [=y])
      [*]   IP: advanced router
        [*]     IP: policy routing
      [*]   MPTCP protocol
      [*]     MPTCP: advanced path-manager control  --->
        <*>   MPTCP Full-Mesh Path-Manager
</pre>}}
If you want to use the Coupled Congestion Control, that guarantees fairness across a shared bottleneck, you have to enable
{{Kernel||<pre>
Networking support (NET [=y])
  Networking options
    TCP/IP networking (INET [=y])
      [*]   TCP: advanced congestion control  --->
        <*>   MPTCP COUPLED CONGESTION CONTROL
        <*>   MPTCP Opportunistic Linked Increase
</pre>}}
