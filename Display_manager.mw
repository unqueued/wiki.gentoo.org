A '''display manager''', sometimes known as ''login manager'', presents the user with a graphical login screen to start an X server session.

== Auto-starting a display manager at boot ==
Usually a display manager is started automatically at boot time. The regular Gentoo way is to use [[OpenRC]] and manage this as a boot service. First, set the ''DISPLAYMANAGER'' variable in {{path|/etc/conf.d/xdm}} to the display manager of your choice. Then add the ''xdm'' service to the default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm}}
