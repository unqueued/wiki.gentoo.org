== Configuration ==

In major Linux operating systems display managers are started automatically on boot. In order for this to happen automatically a script must be added to the proper init system's runlevel. Examples for [[Display_manager#OpenRC|OpenRC]] and [[Display_manager#Systemd|Systemd]] are provided below.

Be careful to read the documentation for each display manager, as slightly different configuration will be required. For more information see the respective wiki entry for the display manager of choice.

=== OpenRC ===

Under most circumstances the [[OpenRC]] init system (Gentoo's default init system) will be used to start the display manager. The XDM init script handles the starting of the display manager. Configuration of the conf.d file is needed to set a default display manager for the system. 

The following examples will set KDE to be the default display manager. Adjust as necessary for other display managers.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|title=Setting KDM as the default display manager|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
}}

To start KDM on boot, add the XDM init script to the system's default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

To start KDM immediately, run:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

=== Systemd ===

If using [[systemd]] as the init system, first locate a {{Path|.service}} file. Some can be found in the [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=user/systemd.git;a=tree;f=sys-apps/systemd-units/files/services-desktop systemd overlay], choose one that works and move it to {{Path|/etc/systemd/system}} or install {{Package|sys-apps/systemd-units}} from the overlay.

To start KDM on boot, enable the following service:
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable kdm.service}}

To start KDM immediately run this command:
{{RootCmd|systemctl start kdm.service}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Dual monitor issues ===

==== nVidia card/drivers ====

When you use more than one monitor, you must set the first output for the right loading in your primary screen, the nVidia users using nVidia drivers can set it right by enabling the twinview option.

this is an example of the section screen, where the primary monitor is set to the DVI output (DFP-0):

{{CodeBox|title=/etc/X11/xorg.conf|1= 
Section "Screen"
    Identifier     "Screen0"
    Device         "Device0"
    Monitor        "Monitor0"
    DefaultDepth    24
    Option         "Stereo" "0"
    Option "TwinView"                               # enables TwinView
    Option "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder" "DFP-0, CRT-1"   # this tells which output should be the primary screen for X
    SubSection     "Display"
        Depth       24
    EndSubSection
EndSection
}}
