* WDM (WINGs Display Manager) - {{Package|x11-misc/wdm}}

== Configuration ==
In major Linux operating systems display managers are started automatically on boot. In order for this to happen automatically a script must be added to the proper init system's runlevel. Examples for [[Display_manager#OpenRC]] and [[Display_manager#Systemd]] are provided below.

Be careful to read the documenation for each display manager, as sightly different configuration will be required. For more information see the respective wiki entry for the display manager of choice.

=== OpenRC ===
Under most circumstances the [[OpenRC]] init system (Gentoo's default init system) will be used to start the display manager. The XDM init script handles the starting of the display manager. Configuration of this file is needed to set a default display manager for the system. 

The following examples will set KDE to be the default display manager. Adjust as necessary for other display managers.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|title=Setting KDM as the default display manager in the XDM init script|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
}}

To start KDM on boot, add the XDM init script to the system's default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

To start KDM immedately, run:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

=== Systemd ===

If using [[systemd]] as the init system, first locate a {{Path|.service}} file. Some can be found in the [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=user/systemd.git;a=tree;f=sys-apps/systemd-units/files/services-desktop systemd overlay]. Choose one that works move it to {{Path|/etc/systemd/system}} or install {{Package|sys-apps/systemd-units}} from the overlay.

To start KDM on boot, enable the following service:
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable kdm.service}}

To start KDM immediately run this command:
{{RootCmd|systemctl start kdm.service}}
