The '''world set''' encompasses the [[System set (Portage)|''system set'']] and the [[Selected set (Portage)|''selected set'']].

Packages belonging to the world set are listed by default into the {{Path|/var/lib/portage/world}} file.

It is the world file, together with the [[profile]] and {{Path|/etc/portage}} (including {{Path|make.conf}}) settings, that defines what software is installed on the system. 

Later, when a world update is requested (through {{c|emerge -uDN @world}} or similar command), Portage will use the world file as the base for its update calculations.
