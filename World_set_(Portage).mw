'''The world set encompasses the [[System|sytem]] set and the [[Selected|selected]] set.'''

Packages belonging to the world set are listed by default into the {{Path|/var/lib/portage/world}} file.

It is the world file, together with the [[profile]] and {{Path|/etc/portage}} (including {{Path|make.conf}}) settings, that defines which software is installed on the system. 

Later, when a world update is requested (through '''emerge -uDN @world''' or similar), Portage will use this file as the base for its update calculations.
