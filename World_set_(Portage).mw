The '''world set''', also referred to as '''@world''' in Portage development, encompasses the [[System set (Portage)|''system set'']] and the [[Selected set (Portage)|''selected set'']].

Packages belonging to the world set are listed by default into the {{Path|/var/lib/portage/world}} file.

It is the world file, together with the [[Profile (Portage)|profile]] and {{Path|/etc/portage}} (including {{Path|make.conf}}) settings, that defines what software is installed on a system using [[Portage]]. 

Later, when a world update is requested (through {{c|emerge -uDN @world}} or similar command), Portage will use the world file as the base for its update calculations.

== Checking ==

The {{c|emaint}} command can be used to see if any problems exist in the world file:

{{Cmd|/usr/sbin/emaint --check world|output=<pre>
Emaint: check world        100% [============================================>]
</pre>}}

== Keep it clean ==

In order to avoid problems in dependency resolution when updating the system, the {{Path|/var/lib/portage/world}} file should contain as few dependencies as possible.  So use the {{c|--oneshot (-1)}} option for emerging dependencies.  

Dependencies already listed in this file can be found using the {{c|[[Q_applets#Listing_packages_which_depend_on_some_package_.28qdepends.29|qdepends]] -Q}} command and be collected in a file say {{Path|/tmp/deselect}}:

{{Cmd|while read i ; do if [ -n "$(qdepends -Q $i)" ]; then echo $i >> /tmp/deselect ; fi; done < /var/lib/portage/world}}

Entries collected in {{Path|/tmp/deselect}} can be cross-checked using the --depclean option:

{{Cmd|emerge -pv --depclean $(cat /tmp/deselect)}}

The {{c|emerge --deselect}} option will remove these entries without unmerging them.

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --deselect $(cat /tmp/deselect)}}

In case {{c|emerge --depclean -p}} indicates some needed or wanted package would be unmerged, those can be re-added using the {{c|--noreplace}} option:

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask --noreplace <atom>}}

It will add the atom to the {{Path|/var/lib/portage/world}} file without compiling it again.
