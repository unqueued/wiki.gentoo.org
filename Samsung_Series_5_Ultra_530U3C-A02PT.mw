== Preamble / Special Requirements  ==

The current setup was designed for a working laptop with a focus on performance and security.
It features:

* Full disk encryption
* Optimizations for a Solid State Disk (SSD)

{{Note|The original 500GB HDD was replaced by a 120GB SSD so some options (filesystem, <code>/var/tmp</code> location, etc.) were taken to reflect this change.}}
