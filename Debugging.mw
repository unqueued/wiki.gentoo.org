== Install debugging information and sources for selected packages ==

To install debugging information you can use the <code>splitdebug</code> feature (or alternatively the <code>nostrip</code> feature) and to install the source code you need the <code>installsources</code> feature which in turn requires the {{Package|dev-util/debugedit}}. These features are integrated so they provide you with an environment where {{Package|sys-devel/gdb}} can find both the debugging information and the sources and lets you fully use its interactive debugging features.

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/env|/etc/portage/env/debug]]|1=
CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -ggdb"
FEATURES="${FEATURES} splitdebug installsources"
}}

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/package.use]]|1=
category/your-package debug
}}

{{emerge|dev-util/debugedit sys-devel/gdb}}

{{emerge|params+=--oneshot|category/your-package}}

== Valgrind ==

You often need to have gcc debug information in order to run valgrind on any binary at all.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|1=
sys-libs/glibc debug
}}

It is possible that valgrind refuses to launch with an error containing the following.
<pre>
valgrind:  A must-be-redirected function                        
valgrind:  whose name matches the pattern:      strlen          
valgrind:  in an object with soname matching:   ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 
</pre>

In this case, you need to<ref>https://wwwtech.de/articles/2012/jan/valgrind-again:-strlen-redirection</ref>:

Create a copy of the glibc ebuild in a [[Overlay/Local overlay|local overlay]], then edit the file sys-libs/glibc/file/eblits/common.eblit, line 206 :

{{FileBox|filename=/path/to/overlay/.../sys-libs/glibc/file/eblits/common.eblit|1=
append-flags -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing
}}

and add <pre>-fno-builtin-strlen</pre> at the end of the line.

Also, aactivate the nostrip feature:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|1=
FEATURES="nostrip"
}}

{{emerge|params+=--oneshot|sys-libs/glibc}}

You can remove or comment out the FEATURES line after glibc is merged.
