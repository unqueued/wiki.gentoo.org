== Install debugging information and sources for selected packages ==

To install debugging information you can use the <code>splitdebug</code> feature (or alternatively the <code>nostrip</code> feature and to install the source code you need the <code>installsources</code> feature which in turn requires the {{Package|dev-util/debugedit}}. These features are integrated so they provide you with an environment where {{Package|sys-devel/gdb}} can find both the debugging information and the sources and lets you fully use its interactive debugging features.

== Valgrind ==

You often need to have gcc debug information in order to run valgrind on any binary at all.
