Porting Gentoo to new architectures/platforms/etc...

{{Metadata|abstract=A guide for porting Gentoo to new or alternative platforms.}}

__TOC__

== Introduction ==

As developers expand Gentoo to new architectures and platforms, they may find there is not any real collection of knowledge which explains all the little details of Portage and moving a platform into the experimental release stage.  This document aims to address that. Here we port Gentoo Linux to the SuperH (sh) architecture, but the details should be pretty straight forward for other architectures and operating systems.

== Getting the system running ==

This is the hardest step by far (really!).  There are two ways to get going. You can start with an existing Linux port out there (Debian, RedHat, some random hobbyist distribution, etc...), or you can cross compile the entire system. The first route is the easiest, so we will cover that first.  Simply boot up the system with the existing port and make sure it has all the important packages installed for development. A quick checklist (with recommended minimum versions):

* binutils (2.20)
* gcc      (4.4)
* glibc    (2.11)
* python   (2.7)
* rsync
* wget
* tar
* gzip
* bzip2
* bash     (must be 2.05b or newer, ver 3 is best)

== Converting to Gentoo ==

Once you have these packages, you can easily install Portage. This script has been written to do the task. Simply download it and run:

{{RootCmd
|wget https://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/bootstrap-portage
|sh ./bootstrap-portage
}}

''todo: move this file to the portage tree and parse the portage ebuild ...''

Then we need to make a profile for the new architecture :

{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/profiles/default/linux/sh
|cd /usr/local/portage/profiles/default/linux/sh
|echo '..' > parent
|cat << EOF > make.defaults<br>ARCH{{=}}"sh"<br>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS{{=}}"sh"<br>GRP_STAGE23_USE{{=}}"pam"<br>EOF
|mkdir -p /etc/portage
|cd /etc/portage
|ln -sfT ../usr/local/portage/profiles/default/linux/sh make.profile
|echo "PORTDIR_OVERLAY{{=}}/usr/local/portage" >> make.conf
}}

Finally, sync up and we should have our Portage tree!

{{RootCmd|emerge --sync}}

== Preparing a seed for Catalyst ==

Since none of the ebuilds in Portage know about our new arch, we can cheat with package.keywords and using x86 as the reference architecture:

{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /etc/portage
|printf '%s x86\n' $(USE{{=}}"-*" ACCEPT_KEYWORDS{{=}}x86 emerge @system -qep --cols {{!}} awk '{print $2}') >> package.keywords
}}

Then we simply emerge the system into a new root and create a seed tarball with the result:

{{RootCmd
|env ROOT{{=}}~/gentoo-seed/ USE{{=}}"-*" emerge @system
|tar jpcf ~/seed.tar.bz2 ~/gentoo-seed/
}}

== Preparing a Portage snapshot for Catalyst ==

Now, take the list generated in package.keywords, and add the "sh" KEYWORD to them. If you use 'ekeyword' from the app-portage/gentoolkit-dev package, things will go much faster. Once the Portage tree has been updated, create
a Catalyst snapshot:

{{RootCmd|catalyst -C target{{=}}snapshot version_stamp{{=}}sh}}

Before we can make [[Stage tarball|stages]] with catalyst, we need to teach catalyst something about our new arch. Go into /usr/lib/catalyst/arch/ and copy one of the small py modules to sh.py. Then edit it to reflect the sh architecture. Finally edit the generic_stage_target.py file in /usr/lib/catalyst/modules/. You just have to update the targetmap and machinemap variables.

Then try building a stage1 with Catalyst and the seed.

{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /var/tmp/catalyst/builds
|mv ~/seed.tar.bz2 /var/tmp/catalyst/builds/
|catalyst -C \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;snapshot{{=}}sh version_stamp{{=}}sh \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;subarch{{=}}sh profile{{=}}default/linux/sh \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;rel_type{{=}}default target{{=}}stage1 \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;source_subpath{{=}}seed}}

If everything goes well, you should end up with a [[Stage tarball#Stage 1|stage1 tarball]] which you can then make a stage2 and a stage3 from.

=== Alternative ===

If you don't like the idea of running `catalyst` by hand (i know, it sucks), you can grab this script:

http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/build-stages

It will generate the Portage snapshot and [[Stage tarball|stage]][123] files for you. Simply edit the settings at the top of the script (see above for proper settings). You will still have to move the seed tarball to the catalyst dir.

== Pushing work into the Portage tree ==

If we don't want all this work to be for nothing, we have to share it :). Here's what needs to be updated so you don't start committing half broken work (and making other developers very angry).

=== Create the profiles ===

Our first profile was just a 'make it work' solution.  Now you have to create a much more complete one. After you've committed the profile, update the following files in the profiles/ subdir:
* arch.list
* profiles.desc

You should declare the profile status in profiles.desc as 'exp' for now (it'll keep people from yelling at you, trust me on this).

=== Start committing KEYWORDS ===

At this point, you should be able to start updating ebuilds in the tree with the new KEYWORD.
