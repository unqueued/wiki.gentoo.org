[https://www.bestpractical.com/rt/ Request Tracker (RT)] is a battle-tested issue tracking system which thousands of organizations use for bug tracking, help desk ticketing, customer service, workflow processes, change management, network operations, youth counselling and even more. [https://www.bestpractical.com/rt/who.html Organizations around the world] have been running smoothly thanks to RT for over 10 years.

== About This Guide ==

This guide was written using the latest version of RT available, which at the time of this writing is 4.2.9.

This guide assumes that you are familiar enough with [[Apache]] or [[Lighttpd]] and will not delve into the details of either.

Whether or not you use virtual hosting holds no bearing on the bulk of this guide. It will be noted if there's something significantly different that must be done in a virtual hosting environment.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=www-apps/rt}}

=== Requirements ===

RT requires a database backend and works equally well with either [[MySQL]] or [[PostgreSQL]]. You must enable at most one of their USE flags:

{{RootCmd|echo "www-apps/rt mysql" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

{{RootCmd|echo "www-apps/rt postgres" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

RT also requires a Web server. The default is to run on [[Apache]], but you can use [[lighttpd]]. To use lighttpd, you must enable its USE flag:

{{RootCmd|echo "www-apps/rt lighttpd" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

=== Emerge ===

Many of the packages RT depends on, including RT's own package, are keyword masked. Use the following command to have a patch automatically generated for you.

{{RootCmd|emerge -av --autounmask-write {{=}}www-apps/rt-4.2.9}}

Once the previous command has finished, use <code>dispatch-conf</code> to apply the patch:

{{RootCmd|dispatch-conf}}

Run emerge again:

{{RootCmd|emerge -av www-apps/rt}}

If you have the <code>vhosts</code> USE flag enabled, you'll need to run <code>webapp-config</code> to finish the installation:

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -I -h localhost -d rt rt 4.2.9}}

== Setup and Configuration ==

=== Database ===

RT provides a script called <code>rt-setup-database</code> which creates the initial database and a database user for you.

{{RootCmd|/var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9/sbin/rt-setup-database --action init --dba dbasuperuser --prompt-for-dba-password|output=<pre>
In order to create or update your RT database, this script needs to connect to your
Pg instance on localhost (port '') as postgres
Please specify that user's database password below. If the user has no database
password, just press return.

Password: 
Working with:
Type:   Pg
Host:   localhost

</pre>}}
=== Configuring RT ===

RT uses an overlay system for configuration. This means that the default configuration is declared in {{Path|/var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9/etc/RT_Config.pm}}, and that custom configurations are declared in {{Path|/var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm}}. {{Path|RT_SiteConfig.pm}} will not exist until you create it. Any custom configuration in {{Path|RT_SiteConfig.pm}} will be preserved in upgrades, while the default configurations, {{Path|RT_Config.pm}}, will be overwritten.

You can copy just certain sections from {{Path|RT_Config.pm}} to {{Path|RT_SiteConfig.pm}}, or you can create a full copy.

{{RootCmd|cd /var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9/etc
|cp RT_Config.pm RT_SiteConfig.pm
|chmod u+w RT_SiteConfig.pm
|$EDITOR RT_SiteConfig.pm}}

The configuration file is well documented, but you may want to consult the [https://www.bestpractical.com/docs/ official documentation].

==== Sendmail Alternatives ====

If you don't have, or don't want, a full-blown SMTP server running, you can use a lightweight client to send the emails instead as long as it provides a sendmail-compatible executable. You can pass specific options via your RT_SiteConfig.pm.

=== Configuring the Web Server ===

Request Tracker can be run on any [http://plackperl.org/ PSGI compliant server]. However, [[Apache]] and [[Lighttpd]] are proven platforms.

==== Apache ====

Only information pertinent to RT will be covered. Additional information about [[Apache]] is covered elsewhere.

There's little information about which method works better for RT on Apache, and benchmarks have shown mod_perl and FastCGI to be nearly equal.

===== mod_perl =====

Save the following snippet within the individual <code>VirtualHost</code> tags you installed RT to or {{Path|/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/default_vhost.include}}.

{{CodeBox|lang=apache|1=
# Replace /rt with the proper URL path after the domain name
<Location /rt>
    SetHandler modperl
    PerlResponseHandler Plack::Handler::Apache2
    # Correct this path
    PerlSetVar psgi_app /var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9/sbin/rt-server
</Location>

<Perl>
    use Plack::Handler::Apache2;
    # Correct this one, too
    Plack::Handler::Apache2->preload("/var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9/sbin/rt-server");
</Perl>
}}

In case you haven't done so already, instruct Apache to start with mod_perl enabled.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/apache2|1=
APACHE2_OPTS="... -D PERL"
}}

You may need to change the owner and group of RT's Mason data directory.

{{RootCmd|chown -R apache:apache /var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9/var/mason_data}}

===== mod_fastcgi =====

NOTE: If you wish to use <code>mod_fastcgi</code>, you need to instruct <code>webapp-config</code> to install <code>rt</code> with appropriate permissions. Edit <code>/etc/vhosts/webapp-config</code>:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/vhosts/webapp-config|1=VHOST_DEFAULT_UID="rt"
VHOST_DEFAULT_GID="rt"}}

Save the following snippet within the individual <code>VirtualHost</code> tags you installed RT to or {{Path|/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/default_vhost.include}}.

{{CodeBox|1=# You may need to tell FastCGI to put its temporary files somewhere sane
#FastCgiIpcDir /tmp

# Match the path to the file system location
FastCgiServer /var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9-r1/sbin/rt-server.fcgi -processes 5 -idle-timeout 300

# Match the first path to the URL where RT is actually available
# Match the second path to the file system location
ScriptAlias /rt /var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9-r1/sbin/rt-server.fcgi/

# Match the path to the URL where RT is actually available
<Location /rt>
    <IfVersion >= 2.4> # For Apache 2.4
        Require all granted
    </IfVersion>
    <IfVersion < 2.4>  # For Apache 2.2
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </IfVersion>

    Options +ExecCGI
    SetHandler fastcgi-script
</Location>}}

Edit <code>/etc/conf.d/apache2</code> to instruct <code>apache2</code> to start with <code>FASTCGI</code> and enabled.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/apache2|1=APACHE2_OPTS="-D FASTCGI"}}

If this is your first time installing apache, you will want it to start on bootup.

{{RootCmd|rc-update add apache2 default}}

Restart apache so that all changes made so far will take effect.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/apache2 restart}}

==== lighttpd (untested) ====

You can run RT on <code>lighttpd</code> + <code>fastcgi</code>. The ebuild will install an initscript <code>/etc/init.d/rt</code> and a config file <code>/etc/conf.d/rt</code>.

NOTE: If you wish to use <code>mod_fastcgi</code>, you need to instruct <code>webapp-config</code> to install <code>rt</code> with appropriate permissions. Edit <code>/etc/vhosts/webapp-config</code>:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/vhosts/webapp-config|1=VHOST_DEFAULT_UID="rt"
VHOST_DEFAULT_GID="rt"}}

You will need to edit <code>/etc/conf.d/rt</code> to set [[RTPATH]] to the root of your installation. You shouldn't need to edit anything else in that file.

Also note that, under the default configuration, the socket in <code>$FCGI_SOCKET_PATH</code> is owned by rt:lighttpd, and is chmod-ded to g+rwx. This means that user <code>lighttpd</code> needs to be in the <code>rt</code> group. One way to do that is to use <code>vigr</code>. If you don't like that, edit <code>/etc/init.d/rt</code> to suit your needs.

You will also need to edit <code>/etc/lighttpd.conf</code> to enable <code>mod_fastcgi</code>.

* Uncomment <code>mod_fastcgi</code> under <code>server.modules</code>
* set <code>server.document-root</code>
* set <code>fastcgi.server</code> to something like this:
{{fileBox|filename=/etc/lighttpd.conf|1=
 fastcgi.server = ( "/rt" =&gt;
 ( "rt" =&gt;
 (
 "socket" =&gt; "/var/www/localhost/rt-3.6.1/var/appSocket",
 "check-local" =&gt; "disable"
 )
 )
 )
}}
Be sure to set the correct path to socket (same as <code>$FCGI_SOCKET_PATH</code> in <code>/etc/conf.d/rt</code>).

Now, start <code>rt</code> and <code>lighttpd</code>:

{{RootCmd
|/etc/init.d/rt start
|/etc/init.d/lighttpd start}}

If things don't seem to be working, check the <code>lighttpd</code> logs in <code>/var/log/lighttpd</code> and edit <code>/etc/init.d/rt</code> as per the comments in the file to make the <code>rt</code> daemon more verbose.

Note: you should be able to use this initscript with any <code>fastcgi</code>-enabled webserver. Please send me an email if you get <code>rt</code> to work with any other webserver.

== Feeding Emails Into RT ==

There are a variety of methods to feed email into RT. If you have an MTA -- such as Postfix, Exim, or the real Sendmail -- you'll be better off using it. Follow the [[#MTA On Same Server|MTA On Same Server]] portion of this section.

However, if you're fetching email from a remote server, you don't have to install an MTA, just 2 or 3 smaller utilities. Follow the [[#Without An MTA|Without An MTA]] portion of this section.

=== MTA On Same Server ===

TODO

=== Without An MTA ===

There are 2 utilities you'll need: fetchmail and msmtp. In case you're using aliases delivered to the same email box, you'll want procmail as well.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fetchmailrc|title=Configuration file for fetchmail|<nowiki>
set logfile "/var/log/fetchmail.log"
set no bouncemail

poll imap.example.com protocol IMAP;

user "rt@example.com" there with password "password"
ssl
sslproto SSL3
nofetchall
keep
no rewrite
mda "/usr/bin/procmail -f %F /var/www/localhost/rt-4.2.9/etc/procmailrc";
</nowiki>}}

{{FileBox|filename=/var/www/localhost/etc/rt-4.2.9/etc/procmailrc|title=Configuration for procmail|<nowiki>
LOGFILE=/var/log/procmail.log
