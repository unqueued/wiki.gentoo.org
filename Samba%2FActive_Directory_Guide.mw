=Centralized authentication with Samba/Win AD =
This might look a bit weird at 1st but when working on the migration from samba 3 with LDAP to samba 4 AD.<br />
This seem to be the only choice we have as we have to remove the LDAP Server on the server that running Samba 4 AD.<br />

Else you would have 2 server.<br />
Windows Client using Samba 4 AD and Linux client using an LDAP Server from another which is no longer centralized and defeated the purpose.

== Working method and choice ==
There are a few method. 
# nslcd or nss_pam_ldapd
# sssd

= nslcd or nss_pam_ldapd = 
If you are using 64 bit system, you will need to unmask it.
{{Code|Add these line to /etc/portage/package.keywords|<pre>
#nss-pam-ldapd replacement of both nss_ldap and nss_pam
sys-auth/nss-pam-ldapd ~amd64
</pre>}}

This package will provide what is currently provide by nss_ldap and also nss_pam thus the 2 package have to be removed.
{{Emerge
|nss_ldap nss_pam
|params=--unmerge --ask
}}

Now we can start emerge nss_pam_ldapd
{{Emerge|nss_pam_ldapd}}

== Configuration ==
There are at least 2 method to work on this solution, the result are same but the way of working it are different.
Pick one...<br />
nss-pam-ldapd Setup<ref name="nss-pam-ldapd setup">[http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/setup nss-pam-ldapd setup]http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/setup</ref><br />
Samba Wiki:Local_user_management_and_authentication/nslcd<ref name="Local_user_management_and_authentication/nslcd">[https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Local_user_management_and_authentication/nslcd Local_user_management_and_authentication/nslcd]https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Local_user_management_and_authentication/nslcd</ref>
=== Method 1:  Connecting to AD via LDAP Bind DN and password ===
This method will configure /etc/nslcd.conf to make LDAP binding via an AD account. Communication with AD with this setup is unencrypted, unless your AD and nslcd had setup LDAP over SSL.

Please create a new user with username '''nslcdconnect''' and password '''secret'''.<br />
You might need to do the following:
* ''Enable - disable user change password on next logon''
* ''Disable - user change password''
* ''Enable - Password never expired''.

Assuming that:<br />
* Samba is running locally and accessible via 127.0.0.1
* LDAP Base DN is dc=headoffice,dc=location1,dc=company,dc=com

{{File|/etc/nslcd.conf|Change some line below|<pre>
# The uri pointing to the LDAP server to use for name lookups.
# Multiple entries may be specified. The address that is used
# here should be resolvable without using LDAP (obviously).
#uri ldap://127.0.0.1/
#uri ldaps://127.0.0.1/
#uri ldapi://%2fvar%2frun%2fldapi_sock/
# Note: %2f encodes the '/' used as directory separator
uri ldap://127.0.0.1/

# The distinguished name of the search base.
base dc=headoffice,dc=location1,dc=company,dc=com

# The distinguished name to bind to the server with.
# Optional: default is to bind anonymously.
binddn cn=nslcdconnect,cn=Users,dc=headoffice,dc=location1,dc=company,dc=com

# The credentials to bind with.
# Optional: default is no credentials.
# Note that if you set a bindpw you should check the permissions of this file.
bindpw secret

# The distinguished name to perform password modifications by root by.
rootpwmoddn cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=headoffice,dc=location1,dc=company,dc=com

# Mappings for Active Directory
pagesize 1000
referrals off
idle_timelimit 800
filter passwd (&(objectClass=user)(!(objectClass=computer))(uidNumber=*)(unixHomeDirectory=*))
map    passwd uid              sAMAccountName
map    passwd homeDirectory    unixHomeDirectory
map    passwd gecos            displayName
filter shadow (&(objectClass=user)(!(objectClass=computer))(uidNumber=*)(unixHomeDirectory=*))
map    shadow uid              sAMAccountName
map    shadow shadowLastChange pwdLastSet
filter group  (objectClass=group)
</pre>}}



=== Method 2:  Connecting to AD via Kerberos ===

== nssswitch.conf connfiguration ==
You will need to edit your /etc/nsswitch.conf according to the following.
This meant that nsswitch will use the new nss-pam-ldapd module.
{{Code|/etc/nsswitch.conf|<pre>
passwd:      compat ldap
group:       compat ldap
</pre>}}

== Executing ==
We can now start nslcd daemon
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/nslcd start}}

to check if our Samba is working fine with our local host use these to verify:
{{RootCmd
|getent passwd
|getent group
}}

You should see your Users or Groups which have unit UID or GID.

If you don't have it. check your /etc/nslcd.conf again.
{{Note|nscd should be off under this condition}}

You can now add nslcd using rc-update
{{RootCmd
|rc-update add nslcd default
}}
