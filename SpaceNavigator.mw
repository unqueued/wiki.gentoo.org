= Information =
This article is written for the SpaceNavigator but it should work with other 3D mouse in the Space-series produced by 3Dconnexion.

= Kernel configuration =
To be able to use spacenavd used in this article you need to compile your kernel with input evdev support

{{Kernel||<pre>Device Drivers -> 
   Input Device support -> 
      <*>   Event interface.</pre>}}

= make.conf =
To get other applications to know about your SpaceNavigator mouse you should add the following to your make.conf

{{File|make.conf ||<pre>
USE="3dmouse"
</pre> }}

= spacenavd =
To get 3D mouse working properly you will need spacenavd.
{{RootCmd | emerge app-misc/spacenavd}}


After installing spacenavd you could check out the following file before starting anything, normally default values works for everyone.

{{File|/etc/spnavrc ||<pre>
# This is an example configuration file for spacenavd. Uncomment and change
# any settings you need and copy it to /etc/spnavrc.
#
# Note that it's much easier to configure sensitivities and figure out axis
# reversals by using the interactive configure utility "spnavcfg", which lets
# you fiddle with all the settings and see the result immediately.
#
# Lines that start with a `#' are comments, and are ignored by spacenavd.

# Sensitivity is multiplied with every motion (1.0 normal).
#sensitivity = 1.0

# Separate sensitivity for rotation and translation.
#sensitivity-translation = 1.0
#sensitivity-rotation = 1.0

# Dead zone; any motion less than this number is discarded as noise.
#dead-zone = 2

# Selectively invert translation and rotation axes. Valid values are
# combinations of the letters x, y, and z.
#invert-rot = yz
#invert-trans = yz

# Swap Y and Z axes
#swap-yz = false

# Serial device
# Set this only if you have a serial device, and make sure you specify the
# correct device file. If you do set this option, any USB devices will be
# ignored!
#serial = /dev/ttyS0

# Enable/disable LED light (for devices that have one).
#led = on
</pre> }}

When finished you can start the spacenavd with
{{RootCmd | /etc/init.d/spacenavd start }}

And add it to start up as default with
{{RootCmd | /sbin/rc-update add spacenavd default }}

If everything worked correctly you should now have a working device in blender ('''it must be emerge with 3dmouse useflag''').

= Extra = 

Optionally you can add the following ebuild to configure dynamically the spacenavd.
{{RootCmd 
|emerge x11-misc/spnavcfg
|spnavcfg }}

[[File:spnavcfg.png|frame|spacenavd gui configuration]]

The changes are immediately transmit to the spacenavd daemon that modify its behavior as requested.
