'''tmux''' (terminal multiplexer) is a program that enables a number of terminals (or windows), each running a separate program, to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. Users familiar with GNU [[Screen]] may find that tmux is a good alternative.

== Installation ==
Insttall {{Package|app-misc/tmux}}:
{{USEflag
|vim-syntax++yes
}}

{{Emerge|tmux}}

The configuration files are located in {{Path|~/.tmux.conf}}

== Usage ==

=== Start session ===
Once started tmux will create a socket for the session in {{Path|/tmp/S-<UID>/<Session Name>}}

tmux can be started with the following command:
{{Cmd|tmux}}

tmux can be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|b}} by default, followed by a command key.

Give the session a reasonable name on startup:
{{Cmd|tmux new-session -t portage}}

Start a command in a screen session without attaching to it (like a daemon):
{{Cmd|tmux new-session -d 'emerge -uDNvp @world'}}

=== Key Binds ===
After pressing {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|b}} the following key combinations can be used:

==== General ====
* {{Key|?}} = List all key bindings.
* {{Key|d}} = Detach the current client.
* {{Key|:}} = Enter the tmux command prompt.

==== Creating/Managing windows ====
* {{Key|c}} = Create a new window
* {{Key|n}} = Change to the next window.
* {{Key|p}} = Change to the previous window.
* {{Key|l}} = Move to the previously selected window.
* {{Key|0-9}} = Select windows 0 to 9.
* {{Key|'}} = Prompt for a window index to select. Then enter a number or title to switch to that window.
* {{Key|,}} = Rename the current window.
* {{Key|w}} = Choose the current window interactively.
* {{Key|:}}, then type list-windows {{Key|enter}} = Display the list of windows.

==== Creating/Managing panes ====
* {{Key|"}} = Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
* {{Key|%}} = Split the current pane into two, left and right.
* {{Key|o}} = Select the next pane in the current window.
* {{Key|;}} = Move to the previously active pane.
* {{Key|{}} = Swap the current pane with the previous pane.
* {{Key|<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} = Swap the current pane with the next pane.
* {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|o}} = Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
* {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|1}} to {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|5}} = Arrange panes in one of the five preset layouts: even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal, main-vertical, or tiled.
* {{Key|x}} = Kill the current pane.
* {{Key|!}} = Break the current pane out of the window.

==== Copy, Paste and Scroll operations ====
The keys available depend on whether emacs (default) or vi mode is selected. The mode-keys option can be set int .tmux.conf for vi mode.

* {{Key|[}} = Enter copy mode to copy text or view the history.
* {{Key|]}} = Paste the most recently copied buffer of text.
* {{Key|#}} = List all paste buffers.
* {{Key|-}} = Delete the most recently copied buffer of text.

=== Resume Session ===
After the session is detached, all the active terminals remain active and so do commands that didn't finish yet. To list existing sessions:
{{Cmd|tmux list-sessions
|output=<pre>standard: 5 windows (created Wed Jul  4 22:12:03 2012) [118x49]</pre>}}
To resume this session:
{{Cmd|tmux attach -t standard}}

== Example .tmux.conf ==
{{File|~/.tmux.conf||<pre>
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"   # use 256 colors
set -g status-utf8 on                       # enable utf-8
set -g history-limit 100000                 # scrollback buffer n lines

# start window indexing at one instead of zero
set -g base-index 1

# set the prefix key and some key bindings to match GNU Screen
set -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a last-window

# key bindings for horizontal and vertical panes
unbind %
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v

# enable window titles
#set -g set-titles on

# window title string (uses statusbar variables)
set -g set-titles-string '#T'

# status bar with load and time
set -g status-bg '#4e4e4e'
set -g status-fg '#ffffff'
set -g status-left ' '
set -g status-right '#[bg=#bbbbbb]#[fg=#000000]#(cut -d " " -f -3 /proc/loadavg) #[bg=#4e4e4e]#[fg=#ffffff]#(
date +" %H:%M ")'
set -g window-status-format '#I #W'
set -g window-status-current-format ' #I #W '
setw -g window-status-current-bg '#55ff55'
setw -g window-status-current-fg '#000000'

# pane border colors
set -g pane-active-border-fg '#bbbbbb'
set -g pane-border-fg '#555555'

# bind to reload config
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf
</pre>}}
