This page currently has some details about NVIDIA and Intel and Hybrid graphics using them.

I was running a setup where:
    My display is connected to the Intel chip physically. 
    There is no hardware multiplexer available (and therefore no BIOS option to switch to one of the cards)
    NVIDIA and Intel cards are the two graphic cards on this laptop.

You have several options at your disposal:

Use Optimus: Official NVIDIA DRiver (blob) and Intel driver : https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NVIDIA/Optimus

Use bumblebee: OFficial NVIDIA Driver(blob) and Intel driver : https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bumblebee-gentoo/
        When running bumblebee, you have two options of using either optirun or primusrun (PRIMUS is NOT PRIME, they are different.)
        Using nouveau and Intel with bumblebee, I couldn't set it up.
        Installing PRIMUSRUN without nvidia-drivers was seemingly impossible because it kept trying to pull it.

Use PRIME: Open Source NVIDIA Driver (nouveau) and Intel driver: http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/Optimus/
         When running this setup with PRIME, DRI2 and DRI3 are two options.
         According to some threads floating around, NVIDIA official driver has better performance than Nouveau. 
         Although nouveau is considered slower than NVIDIA, nouveau + prime + DRI3 was the only option that worked for me.
