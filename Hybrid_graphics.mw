This page details the use of NVIDIA or AMD Switchable Graphics/Intel hybrid graphics.

== When are hybrid graphics useful? ==

* The display is connected to the iGPU.
* There is no hardware multiplexer available (and therefore no BIOS option to switch to one of the cards)
* [[NVIDIA]] or [[AMD]] cards and [[Intel]] SOC are the two graphic cards on the device.<ref>PRIME works with both NVIDIA Optimus and AMD technology https://www.linux.ncsu.edu/bumblebee/</ref>

Run:
{{Cmd|xrandr --listproviders|output=<pre>
Providers: number : 2
Provider 0: id: 0x6e cap: 0xb, Source Output, Sink Output, Sink Offload crtcs: 4 outputs: 5 associated providers: 0 name:Intel
Provider 1: id: 0x45 cap: 0xf, Source Output, Sink Output, Source Offload, Sink Offload crtcs: 6 outputs: 0 associated providers: 0 name:Unknown 
AMD Radeon GPU @ pci:0000:01:00.0</pre>}}

== What options are available? ==

* [[NVIDIA/nvidia-drivers|Proprietary NVIDIA drivers]] with [[NVIDIA/Bumblebee|Bumblebee]].
* [[Nouveau]] with [https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/Optimus/ PRIME].

{{Note|Bumblebee does not work correctly with Nouveau.}}
