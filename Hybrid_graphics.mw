This page details the use of NVIDIA or AMD Switchable Graphics/Intel hybrid graphics.

== When are hybrid graphics useful? ==

* The display is connected to the iGPU.
* There is no hardware multiplexer available (and therefore no BIOS option to switch to one of the cards)
* [[NVIDIA]] or [[AMD]] cards and [[Intel]] SOC are the two graphic cards on the device.

== What options are available? ==

* [[NVIDIA/nvidia-drivers|Proprietary NVIDIA drivers]] with [[NVIDIA/Bumblebee|Bumblebee]].
* [[Nouveau]] with [https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/Optimus/ PRIME].

{{Note|Bumblebee does not work correctly with Nouveau.}}
