This page details the use of NVidia and Intel hybrid graphics.

== When are hybrid graphics useful? ==
* The display is connected to the iGPU.
* There is no hardware multiplexer available (and therefore no BIOS option to switch to one of the cards)
* [[NVidia]] and [[Intel]] cards are the two graphic cards on the device.

== What options are available? ==
* [[NVidia/nvidia-drivers|Proprietary NVidia drivers]] with [http://bumblebee-project.org/ Bumblebee].
* [[Nouveau]] with [https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/Optimus/ PRIME].

{{Note|Bumblebee does not work correctly with Nouveau.}}
