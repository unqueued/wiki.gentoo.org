Wayland is intended as a simpler replacement for X. "It is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be a standalone [[display server]] running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client itself. The clients can be traditional
applications, X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers", states the Wayland-Website.
Where possible, Wayland reuses existing drivers and infrastructure, such as the DRI drivers, the kernel side GEM scheduler and kernel mode setting. 

== Installation ==

=== Wayland ===

==== USE flags ====

Several packages are aware of the <code>[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/wayland wayland]</code> USE flag.

{{USEflag|package=dev-libs/wayland}}

Since GTK+3 Wayland is supported. Unfortunately, the GTK+ port to Wayland has major functionality gaps. Nevertheless, when porting application in general two issues must be covered:
* Ensure that your application uses gtk+-3.0 for its pkg-config request.
* All calls to the gdk_x11_ namespace and raw Xlib calls must be wrapped in [http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.3/ch24s02.html#id1502079 build-time and run-time backend checks].

More details including plans and progress can be found on the [https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/GTK%2B GNOME wiki].

For Qt an additional package called {{Package|dev-qt/qtwayland}} is required. In the Qt Wiki it says: "QtWayland is a Qt 5 module that wraps the functionality of Wayland. QtWayland is separated into a client and server side. The client side is the wayland platform plugin, and provides a way to run Qt applications as Wayland clients. The server side is the QtCompositor API, and allows users to write their own Wayland compositors." 

Porting Qt applications is much easier than GTK+ applications. More information on how to use QtWayland can be found at http://wiki.qt.io/Qtwayland and at http://wayland.freedesktop.org/qt5.html .

==== Emerge ====

{{Emerge|dev-libs/wayland}}

=== Weston ===

Part of the Wayland project is a reference implementation of a Wayland compositor called Weston. Weston can run as an X client or under Linux KMS. 

==== USE flags ====

{{USEflag|package=dev-libs/weston}}

==== Emerge ====

{{Emerge|dev-libs/weston}}

== Usage ==

The Weston compositor is a minimal and fast compositor and is suitable for many embedded and mobile use cases.

Enable examples for building example applications like weston-image or weston-view.

Weston is configured with {{Path|~/.config/weston.ini}}. Examples can be found at the [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wayland Arch Linux Wiki].

Launch Weston with the DRM backend on a VT:

{{Cmd|weston-launch}}

Launch Weston with the DRM backend and XWayland support:

{{Cmd|weston-launch -- --modules{{=}}xwayland.so}}

Launch Weston (wayland-1) nested in another Weston instance (wayland-0):

{{Cmd|WAYLAND_DISPLAY{{=}}wayland-0 weston -Swayland-1 }}

From an X terminal, launch Weston with the x11 backend:

{{Cmd|weston}}

=== Applications ===

As mentioned above GTK3+ and Qt support Wayland. Unfortunately most applications still require the X server. 
Several scenarios are possible to get them working.
* Porting the application by rewriting the components with X.org dependencies such that they work also for wayland. Cf. [http://wayland.freedesktop.org/extras.html Wayland-Ports]. Other examples are  mpv which is a video player based on MPlayer/mplayer2 or the minimalist web-client xombrero, midori and epiphany also have full support for wayland. GNOME and KDE are expected to be ported to it.

* Xclients can be run on Wayland. Afterwards the required application can be run as usual on the Xclient. See [http://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html X server running on wayland]. 
* Xwayland it the third option which is running Wayland on the X server.
