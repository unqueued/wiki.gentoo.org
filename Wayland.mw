Wayland is intended as a simpler replacement for X. "It is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client itself. The clients can be traditional
applications, X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers." 
Where possible, Wayland reuses existing drivers and infrastructure, such as the DRI drivers, the kernel side GEM scheduler and kernel mode setting. 

=== Use Flags ===

{{USEflag
|package=dev-libs/wayland
| doc
| static-libs
}}

Since GTK+3 Wayland is supported. For Qt an additional package called qtwayland is required.

== Weston ==

Part of the Wayland project is a reference implementation of a Wayland compositor called Weston. Weston can run as an X client or under Linux KMS.

=== Launching Weston ===

The Weston compositor is a minimal and fast compositor and is suitable for many embedded and mobile use cases.

Enable examples for building example applications like weston-image or
weston-view.

Weston is configured with the weston.ini file located in ~/.config. Examples can be found at the [//https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wayland ArchLinux-Wiki].

Launch Weston with the DRM backend on a VT
{{Cmd|weston-launch}}

Launch Weston with the DRM backend and XWayland support
{{Cmd|weston-launch -- --modules{{=}}xwayland.so}}

Launch Weston (wayland-1) nested in another Weston instance (wayland-0)
{{Cmd|WAYLAND_DISPLAY{{=}}wayland-0 weston -Swayland-1 }}

From an X terminal, launch Weston with the x11 backend 
{{Cmd|weston}}

=== Applications ===

As mentioned above GTK3+ and Qt support Wayland. Unfortunately most applications still require the X server. 
Several scenarios are possible to get them working.
* Porting the application by rewriting the components with X.org dependencies such that they work also for wayland. Cf. [//http://wayland.freedesktop.org/extras.html Wayland-Ports]. Other examples are  mpv which is a video player based on MPlayer/mplayer2 or the minimalist web-client xombrero. GNOME and KDE are expected to be ported to it.

* Xclients can be run on Wayland. Afterwards the required application can be run as usual on the Xclient. See [//http://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html X server running on wayland]. 
* Xwayland it the third option which is running Wayland on the X server.
