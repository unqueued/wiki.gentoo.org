A '''shell''' is a command-line interpreter that offers a text-based interface to users. It can be used as command-line interface (CLI) on a terminal or [[terminal emulator]], or as a script interpreter running in the background.

== Shells available on Gentoo ==

* [[bash]], the '''B'''ourne '''A'''gain '''Sh'''ell, is the default shell on Gentoo. It is used by [[Portage]], Gentoo's package manager;
* [[zsh]] is an advanced shell that is the chosen interactive shell for many users;
* [[mksh]] is an actively developed free implementation of the Korn Shell, and well suited for scripting;
* [[dash]] is the '''D'''ebian '''A'''lmquist '''Sh'''ell, a small, fast, and posix-compliant shell suited for startup scripts (as {{Path|/bin/sh}} replacement);
* [[tcsh]] is an enhanced version of the Berkeley '''C''' '''Sh'''ell (csh);
* [[fish]] is the '''F'''riendly '''I'''nteractive '''SH'''ell.

{{Note|Many scripts reference {{Path|/bin/sh}}; this is generally a symlink to the shell of choice.}}
