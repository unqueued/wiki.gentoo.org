A '''shell''' is a command-line interpreter that offers a text-based interface to users. It can be used as command-line interface (CLI) on a [[terminal emulator]] or as a script interpreter running in the background.

{{Note|Many shell scripts reference the {{Path|/bin/sh}} file; this is generally a symlink to the shell of choice.}}

For more shell options see the output of the following command ({{Package|app-portage/eix}} required):

{{Cmd|eix -cC app-shells}}

== Configuration ==

=== Changing the default shell ===

The default shell can be changed using the {{c|chsh}} command. To change the default shell for the current user, type {{c|chsh}} and enter a correct path to the new shell. In the example below, a user named {{User|Larry}} is changing his default shell from {{Path|/bin/bash}} to {{Path|/bin/dash}}:

{{Cmd|chsh|output=<pre>
Changing the login shell for larry
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Login Shell [/bin/bash]: /bin/dash
</pre>}}

{{c|chsh}} can be used by the super user account to change the default shell for any user.
