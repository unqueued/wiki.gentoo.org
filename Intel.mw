'''intel''' is the open source graphics driver for Intel GMA onboard graphics cards, starting with the Intel 810.

== Hardware detection ==
To choose the right driver, first detect the graphics card. You can use [[Hardware detection#lspci|lspci]] for this task:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep -i VGA}}

: 1) Needs testing packages: >=mesa-9.1
: 2) A FOSS implementation is in development under the name [http://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/Beignet/ Beignet]

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        <*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
             <*> Intel 440LX/BX/GX, I8xx and E7x05 chipset support
        <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
            [*]   Enable modesetting on intel by default
</pre>}}
For hybrid Intel/AMD system, follow also the steps of [[radeon]] (opensource) or [[Fglrx|fglrx]] (closed binary) drivers.

=== Driver ===
Portage uses the variable '''VIDEO_CARDS''' for enabling support for various graphics cards in packages. Setting '''VIDEO_CARDS''' in {{path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} will pull in the correct video driver: (see the [[Intel#Feature support|feature matrix]]) 

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Gen 1&2|<pre>
VIDEO_CARDS="intel"
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Gen 3|<pre>
VIDEO_CARDS="intel i915"
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Gen 4-7|<pre>
VIDEO_CARDS="intel i965"
</pre>}}

Since xorg-base/xorg-drivers is unaware of i915 and i965 you have to set the video_cards_intel USE flag in case you don't want x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel in your world file. Then you don't need intel in make.conf.
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use|Gen 3-7|<pre>x11-base/xorg-drivers video_cards_intel</pre>}}

Check the USE flags of {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel}}:
{{USEflag|package=x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel
|dri+yes+yes
|glamor
|sna+yes+yes
|udev+yes+yes
|uxa
|xvmc
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

=== VAAPI ===
Intel GMA X4500HD / G45 / GM45 and newer supports [[VAAPI]] hardware video acceleration.

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== xorg.conf ===
The [[X server]] is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit X.Org's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

=== KDM freezes ===
A workaround is to set ''TerminateServer=true'' in all sections of the file {{Path|/usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc}}, which starts with ''X-''.

=== Black screen ===
According to this [http://wiki.debian.org/KernelModesetting Debian wiki], CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE must be set to y (aka built-in).  Otherwise, it is possible to always have a black screen unless nomodeset is passed to the kernel, thus disabling KMS.

You can also try to pass acpi_osi="Linux" to the kernel line to try to solve this kind of issue

=== Brightness doesn't change with keyboard shortcuts ===
First, make sure your vendor compatibility is on in the kernel configuration, toshiba for toshiba and so on.
If it is, or if you're sure that the brightness buttons are working, it's probably that your kernel can't detect where the brightness is.
Luckily, this is easy enough to modify, as long as your kernel version is 3.13.x +.
Simply add {{Kernel|command line|<pre>video.use_native_backlight=1</pre>}} to your kernel command line.
