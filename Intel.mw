{{DISPLAYTITLE:intel}}
''intel'' is the [[X.Org]] graphics driver for Intel GMA onboard graphics card, starting with the Intel i810.

== Installation ==
=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        <*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
            <*>   Intel 440LX/BX/GX, I8xx and E7x05 chipset support
        <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            <*>   Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
            [*]     Enable modesetting on intel by default
</pre>}}

=== 3D/GL support ===
{{Package|media-libs/mesa}} is used for actual 3D/GL support. Note that it has three VIDEO_CARDS flags for intel hardware depending on the hardware model and the kind of MESA driver you want to use. MESA has two architectures for drivers - classic and gallium. The later is the newest architecture in MESA, but for Intel hardware the best support is in classic MESA drivers. For older intel graphics cards use i915, but for hewer (gen6/Sandy Bridge and later) use i965. If none of those are specified, both drivers will be built.

=== Video driver ===
{{VIDEO_CARDS|intel}}
Note the USE flags of {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel}}:
* ''dri'' - (Recommended) Enable hardware acceleration.
* ''sna'' - Enable '''S'''andyBridge's '''N'''ew '''A'''cceleration - a new driver optimization. Also applicable for older graphic cards.

=== VAAPI ===
Intel GMA X4500HD and newer supports [[VAAPI]] hardware video acceleration.

== Configuration and Setup ==
Your user has to be in the '''video''' group to be able to use the hardware acceleration:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a larry video}}

Alternatively you can enable the [[ACL/device nodes|ACL suppport for device nodes]].

== Troubleshooting ==

* [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=xf86-video-intel Upstream Bugzilla xf86-video-intel: known bugs]

=== KDM freezes ===
A workaround is to set ''TerminateServer=true'' in all sections of the file <tt>/usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc</tt>, which starts with ''X-''.
