{{DISPLAYTITLE:intel}}
''intel'' is the [[X.Org]] graphics driver for Intel GMA onboard graphics card, starting with the Intel i810.

== Installation ==
=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        <*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
            <*>   Intel 440LX/BX/GX, I8xx and E7x05 chipset support
        <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            <*>   Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
            [*]     Enable modesetting on intel by default
</pre>}}

=== Driver ===
{{VIDEO_CARDS|intel}}
Note the USE flags of {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel}}:
* ''dri'' - (Recommended) Enable hardware acceleration.
* ''sna'' - Enable '''S'''andyBridge's '''N'''ew '''A'''cceleration - a new driver optimization. Also applicable for older graphic cards.

=== VAAPI ===
Intel GMA X4500HD and newer supports [[VAAPI]] hardware video acceleration.

== Configuration and Setup ==
Your user has to be in the '''video''' group to be able to use the hardware acceleration:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a larry video}}

Alternatively you can enable the [[ACL/device nodes|ACL suppport for device nodes]].

== Troubleshooting ==

* [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=xf86-video-intel Upstream Bugzilla xf86-video-intel: known bugs]

=== KDM freezes ===
A workaround is to set ''TerminateServer=true'' in all sections of the file <tt>/usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc</tt>, which starts with ''X-''.

=== Black screen with i945 ===
The Samsung NC10, HYUNDAI 901, LG X120, Asus EEE PC, and some other netbooks have problems to load the framebuffer with GRUB.

Below is the resolution for 800x600@32.
