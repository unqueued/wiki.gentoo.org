'''intel''' is the open source graphics driver for Intel GMA onboard graphics cards, starting with the Intel 810.

== Hardware detection ==
To choose the right driver, first detect the graphics card. You can use [[Hardware detection#lspci|lspci]] for this task:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep -i VGA}}

: 1) Supported by hardware
: 2) Closed source SDK only

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        <*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
             <*> Intel 440LX/BX/GX, I8xx and E7x05 chipset support
        <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
            [*]   Enable modesetting on intel by default
</pre>}}

=== Driver ===
{{VIDEO_CARDS|intel}}

Note the USE flags of {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel}}:
{{USEflag|package=x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel
|dri+yes+yes
|glamor
|sna+yes+yes
|udev+yes+yes
|uxa
|xvmc
}}

=== VAAPI ===
Intel GMA X4500HD / G45 / GM45 and newer supports [[VAAPI]] hardware video acceleration.

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== xorg.conf ===
The [[X server]] is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit X.Org's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

=== KDM freezes ===
A workaround is to set ''TerminateServer=true'' in all sections of the file {{Path|/usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc}}, which starts with ''X-''.
