'''intel''' is the open source graphics driver for Intel GMA onboard graphics cards, starting with the Intel 810.

== Hardware detection ==

To choose the right driver, first detect the graphics card. {{c|[[lspci]]}} can be used for this task:

{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep -i VGA}}

This should show something like this:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep -i VGA|output=<pre>00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)</pre>}}

{{Note|The {{c|lspci}} output for the graphics controller may refer to ''CPU generations'', whereas the '''Feature support''' table below refers to ''GPU generations''. E.g., “3rd Gen” in the example lspci output above corresponds to “Gen7” in the table below.}}

=== Kernel ===

The following kernel options need to be activated:

{{KernelBox|1=

    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support

            [*]   Enable modesetting on intel by default
            [*]   Enable legacy fbdev support for the modesetting intel driver 
}}

The legacy fbdev support is required since kernel 3.14.14 at least for i915 (<code>CONFIG_DRM_I915_FBDEV=y</code>).<ref>Gentoo Forums, [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-998526.html "Black screen on boot after kernel upgrade - grub2"]</ref><ref>Gentoo Forums, [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7596748.html "Black screen on kernel 3.14.14"]</ref>
For hybrid Intel/AMD system, follow also the steps of [[radeon]] (opensource) or [[Fglrx|fglrx]] (closed binary) drivers.

Since kernel version 4.4 the driver has been moved and the legacy fbdev support is now <code>CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION=y</code>.

=== Driver ===

Portage uses the <var>[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/video_cards_intel VIDEO_CARDS]</var> variable, which expands into the <var>[[:/etc/portage/make.conf#USE_EXPAND|USE_EXPAND]]</var> variable, for enabling support for various graphics cards in packages. Assuming {{Package|x11-base/xorg-drivers}} has already been installed, setting <var>VIDEO_CARDS</var> variable in {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/make.conf#VIDEO_CARDS|etc/portage/make.conf]]}} will pull in the correct video driver: (see the [[Intel#Feature support|feature matrix]]) 

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/make.conf#VIDEO_CARDS|etc/portage/make.conf]]|title=Gen 1|lang=bash|1=VIDEO_CARDS="intel"}}

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/make.conf#VIDEO_CARDS|etc/portage/make.conf]]|title=Gen 2 and Gen 3|lang=bash|1=VIDEO_CARDS="intel i915"}}

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/make.conf#VIDEO_CARDS|etc/portage/make.conf]]|title=Gen 4 through Gen 9|lang=bash|1=VIDEO_CARDS="intel i965"}}

"[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/video_cards_intel intel]" is for {{Package|x11-base/xorg-drivers}} and <code>[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/video_cards_i915 i915]</code> resp. <code>[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/video_cards_i965 i965]</code> [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=522878#c1 are for media-libs/mesa].

Check the USE flags of {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel}}:

{{USEflag|package=x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel}}

After making any changes update the system so the changes take effect by running the {{c|emerge}} command with the <code>--changed-use</code> option:

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

=== VAAPI ===

Intel GMA X4500HD / G45 / GM45 and newer supports [[VAAPI]] hardware video acceleration.

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===

{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== xorg.conf ===

Choose one of the following configuration options:

* Classic Driver -- {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel}}
: As xorg is not aware of i915 or i965 they will need to be addressed as Driver <code>intel</code>.

: {{VIDEO_CARDS/xorg.conf|intel}}

* Alternate Driver for Gen 4+ -- Modesetting -- Experimental

: {{Note|These instructions are labeled as "Experimental" because they are new. Experiences of this configuration can be found in the [[Talk:Intel|Discussion]] of this page. Add any difficulties there so this section can be improved.}}

: As of xorg-server-1.17, the modesetting driver was moved into {{Package|x11-base/xorg-server}}.  This driver has more features than the classic driver, such as GLAMOR.

: xorg-server is easily configured to prefer <code>modesetting</code> over the older <code>intel</code> driver.

: {{VIDEO_CARDS/xorg.conf|modesetting}}

The [[X server]] is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit X.Org's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

=== html5/vaapi gpu hangs ===

If your GPU hangs up when watching [[VAAPI|vaapi-accelerated]] video e.g. on youtube, you can try enabling your IOMMU:

{{KernelBox|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] IOMMU Hardware Support --->
        [*] Support for Intel IOMMU using DMA Remapping Devices
        [*]   Enable Intel DMA Remapping Devices by default
}}

Related [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92814 upstream bug report].

=== KDM freezes ===

A workaround is to set <code>TerminateServer=true</code> in all sections of the file {{Path|/usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc}}, which starts with <code>X-</code>.

=== KDE's plasma eating CPU ===

If /usr/bin/plasmashell is always consuming several percent of CPU, perhaps this is related to a vsync problem.
QT Quick Animation seem to loop too fast when vsync is not managed by the driver ([https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-45959 Reference])

A way to enable vsync with SNA is to enable "TearFree" Option in xorg.conf

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf|lang=xorg_conf|
Section "Device"
        Identifier "Device0"
        Driver "intel"

        Option      "AccelMethod" "SNA"
        Option      "TearFree"    "true"
EndSection}}

=== Black screen ===

* According to this [http://wiki.debian.org/KernelModesetting Debian wiki], <var>CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE</var> must be set to y (aka built-in to the kernel). Otherwise, it is possible to always have a black screen unless nomodeset is passed to the kernel, thus disabling kernel mode setting (KMS). <code>acpi_osi="Linux"</code> can be passed to the kernel command line to try to solve this kind of issue. This is usually done through the bootloader.
* Kernel with version 4.2 or newer is needed with some gen8 chipsets<ref>Gentoo Forums, [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1034212.html "N3700 8086:22b1 i915 black screen, works in kernel 4.2.6"]</ref>.

=== Brightness doesn't change with keyboard shortcuts ===

First, make sure vendor compatibility is on in the kernel configuration. Toshiba for Toshiba, etc.

If it is, or when the brightness buttons are working, the issue is that the kernel can not detect ''where'' the brightness control is located.

Luckily, this is easy enough to modify, as long as the kernel version is >= 3.13.x and < 4.2.

Add {{KernelBox|title=command line|1=video.use_native_backlight=1}} to the kernel command line.

On kernels >= 4.2, the {{c|video.use_native_backlight}} option is no longer available.<ref>RedHat Bug 1272633: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1272633#c5 "video.use_native_backlight=1 doesn't work" (comment 5)]</ref> You should use one of the following instead (experiment to see which works on your system):

{{KernelBox|title=command line|1=acpi_backlight=video}}
{{KernelBox|title=command line|1=acpi_backlight=native}}
{{KernelBox|title=command line|1=acpi_backlight=vendor}}
