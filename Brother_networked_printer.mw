== Prerequisites ==
=== rpm installer ===
As the drivers are available from Brother in the form of .rpm file. You need to have the <code>rpm</code> package installed.

{{RootCmd|emerge -av rpm }}

=== cups ===
You also need cups installed
{{RootCmd|emerge -av cups }}

The cups service must be started before you can install the driver!

===== OpenRC =====
If you use OpenRC use the following command to start the ''cups'' service.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/cupsd start}}  

To have it started automatically at boot time:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add cupsd default}}

===== Systemd  =====
If you use systemd use the following command to start the ''cups'' service.

{{RootCmd|systemctl start cups.service}}  

To have it started automatically at boot time:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable cups.service}}

=== Missing directories ===
Please create these directories before all, it will save you a lot of trouble.

{{RootCmd| mkdir -p /var/spool/lpd}}
{{RootCmd| mkdir -p /usr/lib64/cups/filter}}

=== Drivers ===
==== Downloading the driver from Brother ====
The drivers for Brother printers are available at [http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/index.html Brother solutions'] web page.
Search for you model name by clicking ''Printer driver'' in the Download box.
After having chosen your model you will be presented four drivers for download. Please download the two ones ending in .rpm that are ''LPR driver'' and ''cupswrapper driver''.

==== Installing the drivers ====
Installing the drivers may be a multiple steps process as some needed directories may appears missing on your Gentoo installation.
To install a driver change to the directory where you downloaded the .rpm files.
Then issue the following command to visualize the filenames.
{{RootCmd|ls -a |output=<pre>
.  ..  dcp750cwcupswrapper-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm  dcp750cwlpr-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm
</pre>}}
Of course the driver names may change according to your model's name. Using the previous command will allow you to copy and paste the filenames in the rpm command to avoid typos when entering them.

First install the LPR driver.
{{RootCmd| rpm -i --nodeps dcp750cwlpr-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm }}
You may be told that some directories are missing. In this case, try to add the missing directories by hand and re-install the driver with this command:
{{RootCmd| rpm -i --nodeps --replacepkgs dcp750cwlpr-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm }}
I had to add the {{Path|/var/spool/lpd }} directory and re-install:

Then  install the ...cupswrapper... driver  the same way:
{{RootCmd| rpm -i --nodeps dcp750cwcupswrapper-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm }}
You may be told that some directories are missing. In this case, try to add the missing directories by hand and re-install the driver with this command:
{{RootCmd| rpm -i --nodeps --replacepkgs dcp750cwcupswrapper-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm }}
{{Note|Do not forget the --replacepkgs option to force the re-installation of all the necessary files.}}
In my case, I had to add {{Path|/usr/lib64/cups}} and {{Path|/usr/lib64/cups/filter}}

==== Copying the filter at the right place ====
Copy the filter to the right place with the following command:
{{RootCmd| cp /usr/lib64/cups/filter/brlpdwrapperdcp750cw /usr/libexec/cups/filter/ }}

== Installing the printer ==
=== Start the cups service ===
To install the printer you have to start the '''cups''' service first:

=== Use cups' web interface to install the printer ===
Point your browser at [http://localhost:631 localhost:631].
In the ''CUPS for Administrators'' section of the home page, click on ''Add Printer and classes''. Then, in the Printers box, click on  ''Add printer''.


{{Note|If you are prompted for a user id and a password, enter '''root''' and the root password. If it happens that you enter your standard user's name by mistake, access to add printer will be forbidden.  It could be necessary to leave and reenter the session to be able to declare yourself as '''root'''.}}
In the network choices suggested, choose the ''Host or LPD/LPR printer'' protocol and enter the connection url as suggested in Brother's documentation.
In the case of DCP-750CW I had to use ''lpd://192.168.1.13/binary_p1''  where ''192.168.1.13'' was the IP address of my printer read from the command panel of the printer.
{{Note|Other protocols than LPD/LPR can be used. Please refer to Brother's documentation.}}

After, this the configuration is completely intuitive and free. Just follow the instructions of the wizard.

== Installing the scanner  ==
=== Prerequisites ===
==== sane-backend ====
You will need to have the package ''sane-backends'' installed in order to install the driver for the scanner. As you will probably need ''xsane'' to scan your document, just emerge it. ''sane-backend'' will be  pull in as a dependency.
{{RootCmd| emerge -av xsane}}

=== Installing the driver ===
Download the driver from the [http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_scn.html Brother Solutions]'s download page for scanner. 
{{Important|Pay attention to the family your printer belongs to (depending on it you will have to use either brscan, brscan2, brscan3 or brscan4) and to your architecture (32 bits or 64 bits).}}
Change to the directory where you downloaded the file and do:
{{RootCmd|ls -a}}
in order to be able to copy paste the name. 
Enter the following command:
{{RootCmd|rpm -i --nodeps brscan2-0.2.5-1.x86_64.rpm}}
{{Note|If you forget to install xsane, install it, then add '''--replacepkgs''' as an option to the previous command to reinstall the driver.}}

===Configuring the scanner ===
Once the driver is correctly installed, use the following command:
{{RootCmd|brsaneconfig2 -a name{{=}}monScanner model{{=}}DCP-750CW ip{{=}}192.168.1.13}}
{{Note| ''brsaneconfig2'' should be replaced with the command corresponding to your printer's family (see above), ''monScanner'' with any name of your choice, and ''DCP-750CW'' with your printer's model name.}}
Now check everything is correctly installed:
{{RootCmd|brsaneconfig2 -q {{!}} grep monScanner|output=<pre>
  0 monScanner          "DCP-750CW"         I:192.168.1.13</pre>}}

{{Note|Replace ''monScanner'' with the name you have chosen above.}}

Congratulation! You are ready to use your scanner!

== Commom troubles ==
=== Text shifted up ===
Sometimes it happens that the text is shifted up toward the upper border of the page.
To correct this, enter the following command:
{{RootCmd| brprintconf_dcp750cw -pt A4}}
