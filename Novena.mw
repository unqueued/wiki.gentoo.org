== Installing Gentoo on Novena ==
This instruction describes the Genntoo installation on Novena,
an open hardware and F/OSS-friendly computing platform
(see Novena main page [http://www.kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=Novena_Main_Page www.kosagi.com]).
The easiest way for installing Gentoo without initial bootstrapping
is using the already shipped and working Debian installation,
following a stage3 standard-installation on a second drive e.g.
connected via USB. This guide focuses on the more complicated/Novena-unique
parts and references to the original documentation whenever possible.


=== Prerequisites ===
*A Second hard disk has to be connected to USB (using the USB directly connected to the mainboard). This disk is further on referred to be found at /dev/sdb in the booted Novena/Debian system. After usccessfully booting the new Gentoo system later on, /dev/sdb will become /dev/sda.
{{Warning|Make sure the CPU is sufficient cooled e.g. using a fan. Long compilations can lead to an overheating.}} 


=== Base system installation ===

Follow the standard installation for X86 on
[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:X86/Full/Installation wiki.gentoo.org] but
watch the following differences: 


==== Partitioning ====

The bootloader and linux kernel is stored on the internal SD-card of the Novena platform. After loading the kernel, the standard procedure is to mount the root partition by searching for an unique disk-ID 0x4e6f7653 (see http://www.kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=Novena_Main_Page#Bootloader). The boot process is as follows: SD-card (u-boot → Linux kernel) → hard drive (root filesystem). Because of this, the disk-ID of the new hard drive has to be changed accordingly, e.g. using fdisk:

{{RootCmd
|fdisk /dev/sdb

Command (m for help): x

Expert command (m for help): i

Enter the new disk identifier: 0x4e6f7653

Disk identifier changed from 0x00000000 to 0x4e6f7653.

Expert command (m for help): r

Command (m for help): w
}}


The partition layout for the new installation is as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Device !! File system !! Description
|-
| /dev/sdb1 || FAT32 || Boot (Not needed as boot partition and kernel are placed on the SD-card but it doesn't hurt)
|-
| /dev/sdb2 || Swap ||
|-
| /dev/sdb3 || EXT4 || Root filesystem
|}

The device naming has become confusing in the Gentoo handbook. The translation from partition used in this guide to the on in the handbook is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Novena guide !! Handbook
|-
| [not present] || /dev/sda1
|-
| /dev/sdb1 || /dev/sda2
|-
| /dev/sdb2 || /dev/sda3
|-
| /dev/sdb3 || /dev/sda4
|}



==== Installing a stage tarball ====
The following information can be used to find the correct stage3 archive:

* Architecture = arm
* Subarchitecture = armv7a_hardf
* Common subdirectory on mirror: [host][prefix]/releases/arm/autobuilds/current-stage3-armv7a_hardfp/


==== Configuring compile options ====
Save CFLAGS for Novena can be found at: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Safe_CFLAGS#ARMv7-A.2FCortex-A9_MPCore. The following changes on /etc/portage/make.conf work for Novena:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=text|1=
CHOST="armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi"
CFLAGS="-O2 -march=armv7-a -mtune=cortex-a9 -mfpu=vfpv3-d16 -mfloat-abi=hard -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
FEATURES="parallel-fetch ccache"
CCACHE_SIZE="2G"
}}


==== Choosing the right profile ====
Chose: default/linux/arm/10.0 (or newer)


==== Configuring the USE variable ====
Depends on individual needs, in doubt leave unchanged.


==== systemd ====
Nope, nobody needs it.


==== Installing the sources ====
The kernel is installed independent from the portage version, so no need to emerge it.
See: https://github.com/xobs/novena-linux


==== Additional notes ====
Installing ccache is a good idea as compiling on Novena can take some time.


After finishing the installation, shut down the system and connect the drive
containing the newly installed gentoo installation to the SATA port.
Gentoo should boot up successfully. If not, you still have Debian to check for errors (;

== MyriadRF ==
This is a Software Defined Radio (SDR) module which is plugable to the
high speed interface of the Novena board. The following guide describes the
installation of the drivers and simple usage demonstrations.
