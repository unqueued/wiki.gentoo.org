'''LightDM''' is a cross-desktop [[display manager]] whose aim is to be the standard display manager for the X server.

The key features (as listed by upstream) are:
* A well-defined greeter API allowing multiple GUIs
* Support for all display manager use cases, with plugins where appropriate
* Low code complexity
* Fast performance

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/lightdm|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|x11-misc/lightdm}}:
|gtk+yes
|introspection+yes
|kde
|qt4+yes
|razor
}}

=== Emerge ===

Install lightdm:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/lightdm}}

== Configuration ==

The configuration file for LightDM itself is: {{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf}}

* {{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf}}

=== GTK+ ===

{{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf}}

=== KDE ===

{{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm-kde-greeter.conf}}

The LightDM KDE greeter also provides a KCM (KDE Control Module), which appears in the System Settings under {{Path|System Administration}} → {{Path|Login Screen (LightDM)}}.

Due to LightDM currently assuming GTK+ greeter as the default, if the KDE greeter is requested, it needs to be specified in the {{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf|lang=ini|1=
[SeatDefaults]
…
greeter-session=lightdm-kde-greeter
}}

=== RazorQt ===

The RazorQt greeter currently does not offer any configuration options.

=== Boot service ===

==== OpenRC ====

Set LightDM as the default display manager:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"
}}

To start LightDM on boot, add dbus and xdm to the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add dbus default}}

{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

To start LightDM now:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus start}}

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

==== systemd ====

To start LightDM on boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable lightdm}}

To start LightDM now:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start lightdm}}

=== Command-line tool ===

LightDM includes a command-line tool, {{c|dm-tool}}, which can be used to switch user sessions, lock the current seat, etc. To see a list of available commands, use the <code>--help</code> option:

{{Cmd|dm-tool --help}}

For example, to lock the current seat:

{{Cmd|dm-tool lock}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Cursor themes not working ===

As of March 28, 2015, the stable versions of lightdm (lightdm-1.10.3) and lightdm-gtk-greeter (lightdm-gtk-greeter-1.7.0) have a bug that affects some DEs such as XFCE with setting the mouse cursor. Applications will apply the new mouse theme, but the root window where the window manager draws on does not. To get around this, simply unmask the latest versions (lightdm-1.13.2 and lightdm-gtk-greeter-2.0.0 at the time of writing) and the cursors will be set correctly.
