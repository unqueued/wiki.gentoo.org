'''LightDM''' is [[Article description::a cross-desktop [[display manager]] whose aim is to be the standard display manager for the X server.]]

The key features (as listed by upstream) include:

* A well-defined greeter API allowing multiple GUIs.
* Support for all display manager use cases, with plugins where appropriate.
* Low code complexity.
* Fast performance.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=x11-misc/lightdm}}

=== Emerge ===

Install lightdm:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/lightdm}}

== Configuration ==

The (global) configuration file for LightDM can be found at:

* {{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf}}

=== GTK+ ===

The GTK+ greeter configuration can be modified by manually editing the following file:

{{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf}}

=== RazorQt ===

The RazorQt greeter currently does not offer any configuration options.

=== Boot service ===

==== OpenRC ====

Set LightDM as the default display manager:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"
}}

To start LightDM on boot, add dbus and xdm to the default runlevel. [[dbus]] is necessary because LightDM depends on it to pass messages: 

{{RootCmd|rc-update add dbus default}}

{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

To start LightDM now:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus start}}

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

==== systemd ====

To start LightDM on boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable lightdm}}

To start LightDM now:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start lightdm}}

=== Command-line tool ===

LightDM includes a command-line tool, {{c|dm-tool}}, which can be used to switch user sessions, lock the current seat, etc. To see a list of available commands, use the <code>--help</code> option:

{{Cmd|dm-tool --help}}

For example, to lock the current seat:

{{Cmd|dm-tool lock}}

== Tips ==

=== Running commands at log-in ===

A user can run some programs automatically when logging in using LightDM by adding commands in {{Path|~/.xprofile}}, which will be sourced by LightDM. For example:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xprofile|lang=bash|1=
# Starting redshift, setting the dpi with xrandr and set the brightness to 50% with xbacklight
xrandr --dpi 192 &
redshift-gtk &
xbacklight -set 50 &
}}

=== Unlock GNOME Keyring ===

To unlock your GNOME Keyring ({{Package|gnome-base/gnome-keyring}}) automatically on login, edit {{Path|/etc/pam.d/lightdm}} to look as follows. Note: Lines ending with the comment <code>#keyring</code> should be added.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/pam.d/lightdm|1=
auth	   include	system-local-login
auth       optional	pam_gnome_keyring.so #keyring
account    include	system-local-login
session	   include	system-local-login
session    optional	pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start #keyring
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Cursor themes not working ===

As of March 28, 2015, the stable versions of lightdm (lightdm-1.10.3) and lightdm-gtk-greeter (lightdm-gtk-greeter-1.7.0) have a bug that affects some DEs such as XFCE with setting the mouse cursor. Applications will apply the new mouse theme, but the root window where the window manager draws on does not. To get around this, simply unmask the latest versions (lightdm-1.13.2 and lightdm-gtk-greeter-2.0.0 at the time of writing) and the cursors will be set correctly.

More information can be found in [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-greeter/+bug/1024482 Ubuntu's bug #1024482].
