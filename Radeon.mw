{{DISPLAYTITLE:radaeon}}
''radeon'' is a family of  the [[X.Org]] graphics drivers for modern ATI Radeon graphics cards.

== Installation ==
=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options, note that you don't need to enable ''AGP Support'' if your card doesn't sit in a AGP slot:
{{Kernel|Including radeon driver|<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        <*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
            <*>  AMD Opteron/Athlon64 on-CPU GART support
        <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            <*>  ATI Radeon
            [*]    Enable modesetting on radeon by default
</pre>}}

===Firmware===
There is IRQ microcode for r6xx/r7xx/Evergreen/Northern Islands Radeon GPUs and APUs. KMS may not work without it. It can be installed with:
{{Emerge| x11-drivers/radeon-ucode}}


Make sure firmware for your model (check available ones in <tt>/lib/firmware/radeon</tt>) is included in kernel:
{{Kernel|Including radeon firmware|
 Device Drivers  --->
     -*- Userspace firmware loading support
     [*]   Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
     (radeon/<YOUR-MODEL>.bin)
     (/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
}}


Below is a list of the firmware files needed for each family of cards:

=== Driver ===
{{VIDEO_CARDS|radeon}}

You can force X11 to use desired driver with:
{{VIDEO CARDS/xorg.conf|radeon}}

== Configuration and Setup ==
Your user has to be in the '''video''' group to be able to use the hardware acceleration:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a larry video}}
