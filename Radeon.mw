== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to set the following kernel options:
{{KernelBox|
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->

        If your card sits in an AGP slot, choose your AGP driver, e.g.:
        <*/M> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
            <*/M> AMD Opteron/Athlon64 on-CPU GART support

        <*/M> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            <*/M> ATI Radeon
            [*] Enable modesetting on radeon by default

        -*- Support for frame buffer devices  --->
            < >   ATI Radeon display support

    <*/M> Sound card support  --->
        <*/M>   Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
            [*]   PCI sound devices --->
                  HD-Audio  --->
                      <*> HD Audio PCI
                      (2048) Pre-allocated buffer size for HD-audio driver
                      [*] Support initialization patch loading for HD-audio
                      <*> whatever audio codec your soundcard needs
                      <*> Build HDMI/DisplayPort HD-audio codec support
}}
The options from the Sound card support menu need only to be set if the card supports HDMI or DisplayPort audio and you want to use it. Other options there might be needed as well, e.g. don't set the number of soundcards too low, because even with one Radeon card alsa may detect more than one HDA ATI HDMI device, e.g.
{{RootCmd|aplay -l<pre>

=== Firmware ===
Microcode is required for R600 and newer GPUs. Install either {{Package|x11-drivers/radeon-ucode}} or {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} (contains also other firmware), either:
{{Emerge|radeon-ucode}}
or:
{{Emerge|linux-firmware}}

Also, with packages like these, which introduce a number of non-free blobs into your system, if you are security aware, it pays to use the savedconfig use flag, and do some removing of the unnecessary lines, or better yet uncommenting them, from the respective savedconfig file.  See "How to install the linux-firmware package in Gentoo" in [[#External resources|External resources]]  in bottom.

However, savedconfig editing is entirely optional, if you are in a hurry. System will work the same, with or without the savedconfig editing.

If you compiled radeon directly into the kernel instead of as a module, make sure firmware for your model (check available ones in {{Path|/lib/firmware/radeon}}) is included in kernel:
{{KernelBox|
Device Drivers  --->
    Generic Driver Options  --->
        -*- Userspace firmware loading support
        [*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
            (radeon/<YOUR-MODEL>.bin)
            (/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
}}
{{Note|''radeon/<YOUR-MODEL>.bin'' should be replaced with the full list (space separated) appearing in front of your chipset's name in the table below (e.g. for Northern Islands/TURKS: ({{Path|radeon/BTC_rlc.bin radeon/TURKS_mc.bin radeon/TURKS_me.bin radeon/TURKS_pfp.bin radeon/TURKS_smc.bin radeon/SUMO_uvd.bin}}) }}

=== Driver ===
Portage uses the variable '''VIDEO_CARDS''' for enabling support for various graphics cards in packages. Setting '''VIDEO_CARDS''' to e.g. ''radeon'' (see the [[#Feature support|feature matrix]]) will pull in the correct driver:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|<nowiki>
VIDEO_CARDS="radeon"
</nowiki>}}

Check the USE flags of {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati}}:
{{USEflag|package=x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati
|glamor++no+(For Northern Islands and older cards) Disable Glamor OpenGL 2D acceleration
|glamor++yes+(For Southern Islands and newer cards) Enable Glamor OpenGL 2D acceleration
|udev+yes+yes
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== xorg.conf ===
The [[X server]] is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit X.Org's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

You can force the X server to use desired driver with:
{{VIDEO CARDS/xorg.conf|radeon}}

== Advanced configuration ==

=== Power Management ===
Power management can be set in the [[sysfs]] filesystem as follows:

* Check the current power method:
: {{RootCmd|cat /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method}}

* Change the power method:
: The "dynpm" method dynamically changes the clocks based on demand. (not effective as of June 27, 2012)
: {{RootCmd|echo "dynpm" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method}}
: The "profile" method lets you set a profile on how the card should behave.
: {{RootCmd|echo "profile" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method}}

* Check the current profile:
: {{RootCmd|cat /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile}}

* Change the profile:
: Options for profile:
:# "default" no change of clock speeds
:# "auto" switches between "mid" and "high" power states based on the whether the system is on battery power or not. The "low" power state are selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.
:# "low" forces the GPU to be in the low power state all the time. Note that "low" can cause display problems on some laptops; this is why auto does not use "low" when displays are active.
:# "mid" forces the GPU to be in the "mid" power state all the time. The "low" power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.
:# "high" forces the GPU to be in the "high" power state all the time. The "low" power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.
: {{RootCmd|echo "low" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile}}

* Check the current GPU, Memory clocks and voltage (needs to have kernel debugfs enabled):
: {{RootCmd|cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info}}
: {{Note|With more than one monitor connected, the memory clock will always be on full speed.}}
: {{Note|On APU chipsets, those settings have little to no effect and give inconclusive results.}}


===== Power Management with Linux Kernel 3.11, 3.12 =====
Linux Kernel 3.11 introduces improved power management for some radeon cards, to activate it pass the parameter radeon.dpm=1 to the kernel.
{{Note| Performance APU GPUs can be rapidly increased by enabling this option, which allow them use profiles with maximum clocks.}}
* Check the dynamic power management state
: {{RootCmd|cat /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_state}}

* Change the dynamic power management state
: {{RootCmd|echo "performance" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_state}}
: Other valid options include "battery" and "balanced"

In order to verify that the new dynamic power management code is active check radeon_pm_info (see above), it should say something like
: uvd    vclk: 0 dclk: 0
: power level 0    sclk: 25000 mclk: 15000 vddc: 900 vddci: 950

: {{Note|Using the new dynamic power management will  disable the use of the power profiles mentioned above}}


===== Power Management with Linux Kernel >= 3.13 =====
Linux Kernel 3.13 [http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.13#head-f95c198f6fdc7defe36f470dc8369cf0e16898df enabled dynamic power managment by default] for a lot of video cards.

* Check the current GPU, Memory clocks and voltage (needs to have kernel debugfs enabled):
: {{RootCmd|cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info}}
: {{Note|With more than one monitor connected, the memory clock will '''NOT''' be on full speed as it was before.}}


=== Power consumption when using multi-head / multi-monitor ===
When using more than one monitor at once, the power consumption of your graphics card increases up to additionally 150% of its idle power consumption, because the memory clock switches to fullspeed (see above). This behaviour causes my system (Radeon HD6870) to consume around 30W of additinal power when run in multi-monitor mode than in single-monitor mode. You can avoid this behaviour when using power method "profile" instead of "dpm" and by forcing "profile" to "low". <br />
Using power method "dpm" and setting a low power profile is also possible. However, the "dpm" method does not allow to forcibly remain on a certain power preset, because it uses the GPU hardware to dynamically change the clocks and voltages depending on the current GPU load 

* Deaktivate dpm first (Kernel >= 3.13) with an appropriate kernel commandline via GRUB at boottime:
: {{FileBox|filename=/boot/grub/grub.cfg|1=GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="radeon.dpm=0"}}
: {{Note|"dpm" is the default power management method since kernel 3.13, supported on R6xx and newer asics.}}

* After reboting your system to desktop force the power profile to "low". (You can also do that automated in /etc/local.d/*):
: {{RootCmd|echo "low" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile}}

Limitation: For my KDE desktop environment this procedure will only work when the power profile level is assigned ''after'' KDE has started. An automated command in /etc/local.d/*.start is not sufficient. The memory clock rises and stays up (like normal behavior).<br />

Solution: Let KDE do the job with its autostart feature.

* Allow your user to change the power profile by giving him the appropriate privilege when booting. Create a file like the following:
: {{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/pm.start|1=chown <YourUser> /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile}}

* Add a startscript to KDE autostart:
: {{FileBox|filename=~/.kde/Autostart/pm.sh|<nowiki>#! /bin/bash
echo low > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile
exit 0</nowiki>}}

* Don't forget to make it executable:
: {{Cmd| chmod +x ~/.kde/Autostart/pm.sh}}

You can check the result via kernel debugfs (see above) and it should be similar:
{{RootCmd|cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info<pre>
default engine clock: 900000 kHz
current engine clock: 99990 kHz
default memory clock: 1050000 kHz
current memory clock: 150000 kHz
voltage: 950 mV
PCIE lanes: 16
</pre>}}

Benefit: After these changes, you may use as many monitors as possible without an increased power consumption of your system. Despite the fact that the GPU memory clock is constantly reduced there are still enough graphic resources left to render KDE desktop effects, to play HD movies (also with USE="vdpau") and to do all the regular stuff to get your work done.

===== Tuning with mesa from git =====
Mesa from git (=mesa-9999) offers a different way to tune the 3D driver.  Use the environment variable R600_DEBUG with the following options

* Kernel parameters can be just added to the kernel commandline in {{Path|grub.cfg}} or {{Path|grub.conf}}.
* Environment variables could be put into a file like {{Path|/etc/env.d/99radeon}} to have them initialized during boot.
* {{Path|xorg.conf}} parameter are usual in the ''Device'' section for the card.
* A full list of kernel parameters can be found here: [http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature#Linux_kernel_parameters X.Org Wiki - RadeonFeature]
* S3TC compression needed for some applications like most 3D games: {{Package|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}}

::1) supported by Linux kernel 3.11

=== Monitoring ===
[[lm sensors]] can be used to monitor the cards temperature. It uses the I2C interface, which needs to be enabled in the kernel:
{{KernelBox|title=Including radeon firmware|
Device Drivers --->
    Graphics support --->
        <*> Support for frame buffer devices --->
            <*> ATI Radeon display support 
                [*] DDC/I2C for ATI Radeon support
}}

: {{Note|R6xx and newer radeons have an internal thermal sensor that is exposed by the driver on most cards that utilize it. On pre-r6xx hardware, the thermal sensor was an external i2c chip, so you need to choose and load the appropriate i2c hwmon driver.}}

=== Audio over HDMI ===
Audio through the HDMI port is available for some cards. Check the [http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature#Feature_Matrix_for_Free_Radeon_Drivers X.Org Wiki - Radeon Feature Matrix] for the model family. A recent 3.x kernel may be needed.

If you are using a kernel older than 3.13, HDMI audio must be explicitly enabled using the kernel commandline paramater ''radeon.audio=1''. In addition, [[ALSA]] typically does not use HDMI as the default audio, so one way to force this as the default is to add a config file:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.asoundrc|<nowiki>
pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave.pcm "hdmi"
}
</nowiki>}}
which may be moved to {{Path|/etc/asound.conf}} to make HDMI audio the system-wide default.

Another solution is to set the USE-flag '''pulseaudio''', update the system and use pavucontrol to set the HDMI port as fallback (or use pavucontrol to change manually which application uses which audio port).

==== Multichannel LPCM ====
If you want to enjoy full 5.1 HDMI sound on your gentoo rig try out anssi's HDMI audio patch as mentioned in the phoronix forums.
: {{RootCmd|cd /usr/src/linux}}
: {{RootCmd|wget http://onse.fi/files/atihdmi5.patch}}
: {{RootCmd|patch -p1 < atihdmi5.patch}}
: {{RootCmd|make && sudo make modules_install && sudo make install}}

Check your bootloader config to use the correct kernel and reboot.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Glamor Does Not Load ===

If you see errors like "glamor detected, failed to initialize EGL.", then try enabling USE="gbm egl gles2 llvm" in your mesa builds.

If you see errors like "Failed to link: error: fragment shader lacks `main'", then make sure the glamor package has been built with USE="-gles".

=== Poor X Performance ===

If graphic performance (such as playing videos) is terrible, then make sure KMS Color Tiling is enabled.  You can see this in your Xorg log:
<pre>
[  3407.235] (II) RADEON(0): KMS Color Tiling: enabled
[  3407.235] (II) RADEON(0): KMS Color Tiling 2D: enabled
[  3407.235] (II) RADEON(0): KMS Pageflipping: enabled
</pre>

If you see "no" instead of "enabled", then you'll have to look earlier in the log to see why it's been disabled.  If glamor failed to load, see the previous troubleshooting item.

=== Poor Gaming Performance ===
If you use a 64bit system and play 32bit games (mostly everything in wine and steam), then the main bottleneck are old libraries in the emul-linux packages. For radeonsi cards there is a huge difference in performance between mesa 10.0 (part of emul-linux-opengl, used for everything 32bit like wine and steam) and mesa 10.2 (used for everything 64bit like the desktop).
The only solution is to update the 32bit binaries, either by waiting for an emul-linux-* update or by allowing the system to compile equivalent 32bit binaries to the currently installed 64bit versions, see https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Multilib_System_without_emul-linux_Packages
