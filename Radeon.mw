{{DISPLAYTITLE:radaeon}}
''radeon'' is a family of the X.Org graphics drivers for modern ATI Radeon graphics cards. This article details how to configure the kernel and your userspace in order to use the ''radeon'' driver.

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options, note that you don't need to enable ''AGP Support'' if your card doesn't sit in a AGP slot:
{{Kernel|Including radeon driver|<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
	[*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
	Graphics support  --->
		<*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
			<*> AMD Opteron/Athlon64 on-CPU GART support
		<*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
			<*> ATI Radeon
				[*] Enable modesetting on radeon by default
</pre>}}

===Firmware===
There is IRQ microcode for r6xx/r7xx/Evergreen/Northern Islands Radeon GPUs and APUs. KMS may not work without it. It can be installed with:
{{Emerge| x11-drivers/radeon-ucode}}

Make sure firmware for your model (check available ones in <tt>/lib/firmware/radeon</tt>) is included in kernel:
{{Kernel|Including radeon firmware|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
	-*- Userspace firmware loading support
	[*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
		(radeon/<YOUR-MODEL>.bin)
		(/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
</pre>}}

Below is a list of the firmware files needed for each family of cards:
* RadeonHD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series
 radeon/R600_rlc.bin radeon/R700_rlc.bin

 radeon/JUNIPER_me.bin radeon/JUNIPER_pfp.bin radeon/JUNIPER_rlc.bin
 radeon/REDWOOD_me.bin radeon/REDWOOD_pfp.bin radeon/REDWOOD_rlc.bin
* Radeon HD 6000 APU series (Fusion)
 radeon/PALM_me.bin radeon/PALM_pfp.bin
 radeon/SUMO_me.bin radeon/SUMO_pfp.bin radeon/SUMO_rlc.bin
 radeon/SUMO2_me.bin radeon/SUMO2_pfp.bin
* Radeon HD 6000 series
 radeon/BARTS_mc.bin radeon/BARTS_me.bin radeon/BARTS_pfp.bin

=== Driver ===
{{VIDEO_CARDS|radeon}}

You can force X11 to use desired driver with:
{{VIDEO CARDS/xorg.conf|radeon}}

I couldn't find a summery of all options available so feel free to add to this.
{{Warning|There are several options to tweak the radeon driver and some of these might break your desktop, so if you are uncomfortable with the console better stick to default.}}

* Kernel parameters can be just added to the kernel commandline in ''grub.cfg'' or ''grub.conf''
* Environment variables could be put into a file like ''/etc/env.d/99radeon'' to have them initialized during boot
* xorg.conf parameter are usual in the ''Device'' section for the card
