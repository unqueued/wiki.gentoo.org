In an ebuild, the <code>KEYWORDS</code> variable informs in which architectures the ebuild is stable or still in testing phase.

An example <code>KEYWORDS</code> setting:
<pre>
KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 arm arm64 hppa ia64 m68k ~mips ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc x86 ~sparc-fbsd ~x86-fbsd"</pre>

The prefix <code>'''~'''</code> placed in front of various architectures in the example above means that architecture is in a "testing phase" and is not ready for production usage yet.

== Stabilization requests ==
''(Thanks to [http://blogs.gentoo.org/scarabeus/2012/03/05/stabilisations-and-testing/ this blog post] by Scarabeus = Tomáš Chvátal.)''

Users can file stabilization requests in the Gentoo Bugzilla for packages in testing, i.e. those with the <code>~arch</code> flag. If package the maintainer does not respond to an e-mail request in 30 days, the user can CC to arch testing teams him/herself.

For the basic guide on how developers stabilize ebuilds, see the [[Arch testing guide]] article.

=== Maintainer-needed packages ===
If a package lacks a maintainer check the bug page to see if the package is crash-free or has available patches.

You can check if a package needs a maintainer by one of the following methods:
* Using <kbd>equery meta <package-atom></kbd> (equery is a utility provided {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}).
* Viewing the <code><nowiki><maintainer></nowiki></code> section found in {{Path|/usr/portage/<package-category>/<package-atom>/metadata.xml}}
* Viewing the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/treecleaners/maintainer-needed.xml list of maintainer-needed packages] on the Gentoo site.
