In an ebuild the <var>KEYWORDS</var> variable informs in which architectures the ebuild is stable or still in testing phase.

== Examples ==

The following example contains some possible values for the <var>KEYWORDS</var> variable:

{{FileBox|filename=example.ebuild|lang=bash|1=
KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 arm arm64 hppa ia64 m68k ~mips ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc x86 ~sparc-fbsd ~x86-fbsd"
}}

See the {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/arch.list}} for a list of keywords.

The prefix <code>~</code> (a tilde character) placed in front of various architectures in the above example above means that architecture is in a "testing phase" and is not ready for production usage.

=== Special keywords ===

In addition to the normal <var>KEYWORDS</var> values Portage supports three special tokens:

* <code>*</code> - Package is visible if it is stable on any architecture.
* <code>~*</code> - Package is visible if it is in testing on any architecture.
* <code>**</code> - Package is always visible (<var>KEYWORDS</var> are ignored completely).

If you encounter the <code>-*</code> KEYWORD, this indicates that the package is known to be broken on all systems which are not otherwise listed in KEYWORDS. For example, a binary only package which is built for the {{Keyword|x86}} will look like:

{{RootCmd|equery meta fdftk|output=<pre>
 * app-text/fdftk [gentoo]
Maintainer:  robbat2@gentoo.org
Maintainer:  tex@gentoo.org (Gentoo TeX Project)
Upstream:    None specified
Homepage:    http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/fdftoolkit.html
Location:    /var/portage/repos/gentoo/app-text/fdftk
Keywords:    6.0-r1:0: x86 -*
License:     Adobe
</pre>}}

If you wish to accept this package anyways, then use one of the other keywords in the {{Path|package.accept_keywords}} like this:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|1=
app-text/fdftk amd64
}}

For detailed information see the Portage man page.
