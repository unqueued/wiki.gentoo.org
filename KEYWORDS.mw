== Keywords ==

In an ebuild the <var>KEYWORDS</var> variable informs in which architectures the ebuild is stable or still in testing phase.

The following example contains some possible values for the <var>KEYWORDS</var> variable:

{{FileBox|filename=example.ebuild|lang=bash|1=
KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 arm arm64 hppa ia64 m68k ~mips ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc x86 ~sparc-fbsd ~x86-fbsd"
}}

See the {{Path|/usr/portage/profiles/arch.list}} for a list of keywords.

The prefix <code>~</code> (a tilde character) placed in front of various architectures in the above example above means that architecture is in a "testing phase" and is not ready for production usage.

=== Special keywords ===

In addition to the normal <var>KEYWORDS</var> values Portage supports three special tokens:

* <code>*</code> - Package is visible if it is stable on any architecture.
* <code>~*</code> - Package is visible if it is in testing on any architecture.
* <code>**</code> - Package is always visible (<var>KEYWORDS</var> are ignored completely).

If you encounter the <code>-*</code> KEYWORD, this indicates that the package is known to be broken on all systems which are not otherwise listed in KEYWORDS. For example, a binary only package which is built for the {{Keyword|x86}} will look like:

{{RootCmd|equery meta quake3-demo|output=<pre>
Maintainer:  games@gentoo.org (Gentoo Games Project)
Upstream:    None specified
Homepage:    http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake3-arena/
Location:    /usr/portage/games-fps/quake3-demo
Keywords:    1.11-r1:0: amd64 x86 -*
License:     Q3AEULA
</pre>}}

If you wish to accept this package anyways, then use one of the other keywords in the {{Path|package.accept_keywords}} like this:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|1=
games-fps/quake3-demo x86
}}

For detailed information see the Portage man page.

== Stabilization requests ==

''(Thanks to [http://blogs.gentoo.org/scarabeus/2012/03/05/stabilisations-and-testing/ this blog post] by Scarabeus = Tomáš Chvátal.)''

Users can file stabilization requests in the Gentoo Bugzilla for packages in testing, i.e. those with the <code>~arch</code> flag. If the package maintainer does not respond to an e-mail request in 30 days, the user can CC to arch testing teams them self.

For the basic guide explaining the ebuild stabilization process see the [[Arch testing guide]] article.

=== Maintainer-needed packages ===

If a package lacks a maintainer check the bug page to see if the package is crash-free or has available patches.

Check if a package needs a maintainer by one of the following methods:

* Using {{c|equery meta <package-atom>}} ({{c|equery}} is a utility provided {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}).
* Viewing the <code><nowiki><maintainer></nowiki></code> section found in {{Path|/usr/portage/<package-category>/<package-atom>/metadata.xml}}
* Viewing the [https://qa-reports.gentoo.org/output/maintainer-needed.html list of maintainer-needed packages] on the Gentoo QA reports site.
