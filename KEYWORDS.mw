In an ebuild, the '''KEYWORDS''' variable informs in which architectures the ebuild is stable or still in testing phase.

An example KEYWORDS setting:
<pre>
KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 arm arm64 hppa ia64 m68k ~mips ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc x86 ~sparc-fbsd ~x86-fbsd"</pre>

The prefix <code>'''~'''</code> means it's in "testing phase" for that architecture and not ready for production usage yet.

== Stabilization request ==
''(Thanks to [http://blogs.gentoo.org/scarabeus/2012/03/05/stabilisations-and-testing/ this blog post] by Scarabeus = Tomáš Chvátal.)''

Users can file stabilization requests in the Gentoo Bugzilla for packages in testing, i.e. those with <code>~arch</code> flag. If the maintainer does not respond to your request in 30 days, you can CC to arch testing teams yourself.

For the basic guide on how delevopers stabilize ebuilds, see [[Arch testing guide]].

=== Mainter-needed packages ===
If a package lacks the maintainer, then you should also check the bugs, if it's crash-free, or there are available patches.

You can check if a package needs a maintainer either by
* using <code>equery meta <package-name></code>,
* seeing the <nowiki><maintainer> section in <portage-root>/<category>/<package>/metadata.xml</nowiki>, or
* the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/treecleaners/maintainer-needed.xml list of maintainer-needed packages] in Gentoo site.
