In an ebuild, the '''KEYWORDS''' variable informs in which architectures the ebuild is stable or still in testing phase.

An example KEYWORDS setting:
<pre>
KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 arm arm64 hppa ia64 m68k ~mips ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc x86 ~sparc-fbsd ~x86-fbsd"</pre>

The prefix <code>'''~'''</code> means it's in "testing phase" for that architecture and not ready for production usage yet.

== Stabilization request ==
''(Thanks to [http://blogs.gentoo.org/scarabeus/2012/03/05/stabilisations-and-testing/ this blog post] by Scarabeus = Tomáš Chvátal.)''

Users can file stabilization requests in the Gentoo Bugzilla for packages in testing, i.e. those with <code>~arch</code> flag. If the maintainer does not respond to your request in 30 days, you can CC to arch testing teams yourself.

If a package lacks the maintainer (you can check that by using <code>equery meta <package-name></code> or the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/treecleaners/maintainer-needed.xml list of maintainer-needed packages] in Gentoo site) then you should also check the bugs, if it's crash-free, or there are available patches.
