== Installation ==

A standard installation procedure results in a working system.

=== Kernel ===
This is recommended for all systems using snd_hda_intel:
{{KernelBox|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Sound card support  --->
        <*> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
            (2048) Pre-allocated buffer size for HD-audio driver
}}

This may be required if you plan to use [[nvidia-drivers]] you may encounter the following error during emerging:
{{RootCmd|emerge nvidia-drivers|output=
FATAL: modpost: GPL-incompatible module nvidia.ko uses GPL-only symbol 'mutex_destroy' 
}}
Disable ''CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES'' in the kernel's .config file to fix this.
