= Configuration =

{{Note|I am using SystemRescueCd-x86-4.5.2 as an installation medium, with the 'alternative' (newer) kernel option, installing an EFI stub kernel instead of a boot loader, and using systemd. YMMV with other choices. }}

== Booting ==

To get to the boot/BIOS menu, there is no key combination. Press the recessed button next to the power button instead; unintuitively called the "novo" button by the documentation. You also might have to disable FastStartup and Secure Boot temporarily in the bios menu to get it to boot from your USB device.

== HiDPI ==

The high DPI means that you have to tweak some settings or suffer through tiny nigh-unreadable text while installing. There are larger fonts available at ''/usr/share/consolefonts/'', which can be used by running e.g:

{{Cmd|setfont ter-128b}}

== Wireless ==

The only driver available that supports the card is the proprietary '''wl''' driver, available by installing '''net-wireless/broadcom-sta'''. If you don't have this on your installation drive, you might need to use an external USB NIC.

{{Important|A kernel bug in "ideapad-laptop" prior to 3.17.4 caused the rfkill switch to disable the card. Since the laptop has no other NIC, you need to have a sufficiently recent installation medium or remove this kernel module.}}
