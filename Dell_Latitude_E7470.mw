{{Note|Keep in mind that issues below could be limited to a specific unit of Dell Latitude E7470 as well as depends on BIOS version that has been used."
}}

=== Hotkeys (Volume, Mute, Brightness) as well as LID close/open events ===

Once loaded the Linux kernel, hotkeys for brightness as well as volume control will not change anything on their own. Same goes for closing the LID, the screen will be not turned off automatically. The keys (and lid) do send an acpi events that can be acted upon with sys-power/acpid. One may use ready scripts to control volume, brightness (hotkeys as well as disable screen on LID closed) from [https://github.com/slashbeast/acpid-scripts acpid-scripts] repository.

=== Lack of other 16:9 resolutions than 1980x1080 ===

Not every environment handles HiDPI displays good thus one may wish to scale down the resolution. The E7470 does not support out of the box any other 16:9 resolutions than 1980x1080. One may manually add it to Xorg with parameters generated by `cvt`. An example for 1368x786:
{{RootCmd|cvt 1368 768 60|output=<pre>
# 1368x768 59.88 Hz (CVT) hsync: 47.79 kHz; pclk: 85.25 MHz
Modeline "1368x768_60.00"   85.25  1368 1440 1576 1784  768 771 781 798 -hsync +vsync
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-screen_1368x768_mode.conf|output=<pre>

    Option "PreferredMode" "1368x768_60.00"
