{{DISPLAYTITLE:GENTOO_MIRRORS}}

The <var>GENTOO_MIRRORS</var> variable in {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]}} contains a space-delimited list of [https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/ Gentoo Source Mirrors] that Portage should use to download source code.

A list of [https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/ Gentoo Source Mirrors] is provided on the Gentoo site.

== Choosing a fast mirror ==

A good mirror can make Portage download source code faster. Usually, you can choose a mirror that is near you.

A tool called [[mirrorselect|mirrorselect]] is available in the Portage tree. Mirrorselect can make choosing a fast mirror an easy process. To automatically select the best (fastest) five mirrors and automatically update {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]}} use the following command:

{{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s5}}

Alternatively, to interactively choose the mirrors and automatically update the <var>GENTOO_MIRRORS</var> variable run:

{{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -o}}

To automatically select the 3 best mirrors, deep mode (the <code>-D</code> option) is used to provide a more accurate speed test. Deep mode downloads a 100k file from each server. The output can be redirected to the desired file, in most cases the file will be {{Path|make.conf}}. The example below is a typical redirect case:

{{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s3 -D -o >> [[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]}}
