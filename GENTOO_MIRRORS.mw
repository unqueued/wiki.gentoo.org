{{DISPLAYTITLE:GENTOO_MIRRORS}}
'''The GENTOO_MIRRORS variable - in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} - contains a space-delimited list of mirror hosts that Portage should use to download source code.'''

A list of [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml Gentoo mirrors] is maintained on the Gentoo site.

== Choosing a mirror ==
A good mirror can make Portage download source code faster. Usually, you can choose a mirror that is near you.

A tool called [[mirrorselect|mirrorselect]] is available in the Portage tree, and it can help you choose a fast mirror. To automatically select the best five and automatically update {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}, you might use the following:
{{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s5}}

Alternatively, to interactively choose the mirrors and, again, automatically update your GENTOO_MIRRORS variable you might run:
{{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -o}}

Autoselect the 3 best mirrors.  Deep  mode used  to  give  a more accurate speed test. It downloads a 100k file from each server. Output and redirect to anywhere in the file system.
{{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s3 -D -o >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}
