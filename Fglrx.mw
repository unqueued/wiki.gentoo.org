'''AMD Catalyst''' (previous '''fglrx''': '''F'''ire'''GL''' and '''R'''adeon for '''X''' ) is the proprietary graphics driver for AMD/ATI graphic cards. The open source alternative is [[radeon]].

== Hardware detection ==
To choose the right driver, first detect the graphics card. You can use [[Hardware detection#lspci|lspci]] for this task:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep -i VGA}}

If you have an AGP card, also detect the chipset supporting AGP:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep -i AGP}}

; Force legacy driver when you have Radeon HD 2000 - 4000:
: [[Knowledge Base:Masking a package|Mask]] >=ati-drivers-13.1 and >=xorg-server-1.13:
: {{RootCmd|echo "# Force legacy driver" >> /etc/portage/package.mask|
  |echo ">{{=}}x11-base/xorg-server-1.13" >> /etc/portage/package.mask|
  |echo "x11-drivers/ati-drivers:1" >> /etc/portage/package.mask}}

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need [[USB]] support. Also you need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Loadable module support --->
    [*] Enable loadable module support
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Bus options (PCI etc.)  --->
    [*] PCI Express support
    [*] Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI and MSI-X)
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        < > Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
</pre>}}

If you have an AGP card, enable AGP support:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        <*> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
            Choose your AGP driver, e.g.:
            <*> AMD Opteron/Athlon64 on-CPU GART support
</pre>}}

If you use a hybrid system with Intel integrated video card, you should also activite KMS and Intel driver.  Make sure raedon is disable.
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        <*> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            < > ATI Radeon
            <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
                [*]   Enable modesetting on intel by default
</pre>}}

=== Driver ===
Portage uses the variable '''VIDEO_CARDS''' for enabling support for various graphics cards in packages. Setting '''VIDEO_CARDS''' to ''fglrx'' will pull in the driver {{Package|x11-drivers/ati-drivers}}:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
VIDEO_CARDS="fglrx"
</pre>}}

If you are using a hybrid system, enable intel driver but disable '''sna''' USE flag on it.  See 
{{Bug|430000}}.
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
VIDEO_CARDS="fglrx intel"
</pre>}}
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use||<pre>
x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel uxa -sna
</pre>}}


Check the USE flags of {{Package|x11-drivers/ati-drivers}}:
{{USEflag|package=x11-drivers/ati-drivers
|debug++no
|modules+yes+yes
|multilib
|qt4+yes
|static-libs++no
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

=== acpid ===
Some cards need acpid running to handle events. See the [[ACPI]] article.

== Configuration ==

=== Initial setup ===
This will generate an initial [[xorg.conf]] to {{Path|/root/xorg.conf.new}}:
{{RootCmd|X -configure}}

Copy the file {{Path|/root/xorg.conf.new}} to the default location:
{{RootCmd|cp xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf}}

This will modify an initial [[xorg.conf]] to use the fglrx driver with a single screen:
{{RootCmd|aticonfig --initial --input{{=}}/etc/X11/xorg.conf}}

For dual-head configuration use this instead (where the second screen is  [left|right|above|below]):
{{RootCmd|aticonfig --initial{{=}}dual-head --input{{=}}/etc/X11/xorg.conf --screen-layout{{=}}[left{{!}}right{{!}}above{{!}}below]}}

Set the OpenGL driver to use fglrx:
{{RootCmd|eselect opengl set ati}}

=== Permissions ===
{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== Settings ===
The most comfortable way for most users is to use {{Path|opt/bin/amdcccle}} as a graphical UI to configure the driver.

== Troubleshooting ==
* {{Bug|ati-drivers|search=package}}

=== Unexplained segmentation faults and kernel crashes ===
If you experience unexplained segmentation faults and kernel crashes with this driver and multi-threaded applications such as [[Wine]] set ''UseFastTLS'' in [[xorg.conf]] to either ''0'' or ''1'', but not ''2''.
