AMD Catalyst (previous '''F'''ire'''GL''' and '''R'''adeon for '''X''') is the proprietary graphics driver for AMD/ATI graphic cards. An open source alternative is [[radeon]].

== Hardware support ==
This driver supports Radeon HD 5400 and newer graphics cards. To check if the card is supported: [http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx AMD HCL]

AMD provides a [http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&product=2.4.1.3.12&lang=English legacy driver] for unsupported cards or use the [[radeon]] driver.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Bus options (PCI etc.)  --->
    [*] PCI support
    [*] Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI and MSI-X)

Disable DRM and ATI framebuffer support:
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->
        < > Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
        <*> Support for frame buffer devices --->
            < > ATI Radeon display support
</pre>}}

=== Driver ===
The actual package name for the driver is {{Package|x11-drivers/ati-drivers}}
{{VIDEO CARDS|fglrx}}

Note the USE flags of {{Package|x11-drivers/ati-drivers}}:
{{USEflag|package=x11-drivers/ati-drivers
|debug++no
|modules+yes+yes
|multilib
|qt4+yes
|static-libs++no
}}

== Configuration ==

=== Initial setup ===
This will generate an initial xorg.conf which uses the fglrx driver:
{{RootCmd|aticonfig --initial}}

If this command fails without error, copy the file {{Path|/root/xorg.conf.new}} to the default location:
{{RootCmd|cp xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf}}

Set the OpenGL driver to use fglrx:
{{RootCmd|eselect opengl set ati}}
{{Note|This might already be set by the ebuild.}}

=== Settings ===
The most comfortable way for most users is to use {{Path|opt/bin/amdcccle}} as a graphical UI to configure the driver. Users might need to be in the video group to change settings:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> video}}
