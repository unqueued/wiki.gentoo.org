AMD Catalyst ('''F'''ire'''GL''' and '''R'''adeon for '''X''') is the closed source binary driver for AMD/ATI graphic cards. It was mainly written by ATI to support their FireGL cards on Linux workstations and later AMD continued work as an alternative to their open source effort on the [[Radeon]] driver.

== Installation ==
Support for older cards, released before ~2008, has been dropped in the binary driver. To check if the card is supported: [http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx AMD HCL]<br>
AMD provides a legacy driver version ([[#External resources]]) for unsupported cards or use the [[Radeon]] driver.

=== Kernel ===
Any DRM and Radeon related code should be disabled in the kernel or it might interfere with the closed driver.
{{Kernel|Excluding radeon driver|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
	Graphics support  --->
		< > Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
                <M> Support for frame buffer devices --->
                	< > ATI Radeon display support
</pre>}}

=== Driver ===
The actual package name for the driver is {{Package|x11-drivers/ati-drivers}}
{{VIDEO CARDS|fglrx}}

=== USE Flags ===
{{USEflag
|debug++no+
|modules+yes+yes+
|multilib
|pax_kernel
|qt4
|static-libs++no+
}}

== Configuration ==

=== Initial setup ===
This will generate an initial xorg.conf which uses the fglrx driver:
{{RootCmd|aticonfig --initial}}
If this command fails without error, copy the file {{Path|/root/xorg.conf.new}} to the default location
{{RootCmd|cp xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf}}
Set the opengl driver to use fglrx
{{RootCmd|eselect opengl set ati}}
{{Note|this might already be set by the ebuild}}

=== Settings ===
The most comfortable way for most users is to use {{Path|opt/bin/amdcccle}} as a graphical UI to configure the driver. Users might need to be in the video group to change settings:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <username> video}}
