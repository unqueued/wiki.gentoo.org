AMD Catalyst (fglrx) is the closed source binary driver for AMD/ATI graphic cards. It was mainly written by ATI to support their FireGL cards on Linux workstations and later AMD continued work as an alternative to their open source effort on the [[Radeon]] driver.

== Installation ==
Support for older cards has been dropped in the binary driver, you might want to check if the card is supported: [http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx AMD HCL]
=== Kernel ===
Any DRM and Radeon related code should be disabled in the kernel or it might interfere with the closed driver.

=== USE Flags ===
USE flags for {{Package|x11-drivers/ati-drivers}}
{{USEflag
|debug++no+
|modules+yes+yes+
|multilib
|pax_kernel
|qt4
|static-libs++no+
}}

== Configuration ==
=== Initial setup ===
This will generate an initial xorg.conf which uses the fglrx driver:
{{RootCmd|aticonfig --initial}}
If this command fails without error, copy the file {{Path|/root/xorg.conf.new}} to the default location
{{RootCmd|cp xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf}}
Set the opengl driver to use fglrx
{{RootCmd|eselect opengl set ati}}
{{Note|this might already be set by the ebuild}}
