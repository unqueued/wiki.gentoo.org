[[Category:Laptops]][[Category:Chromebooks]]
== Summary ==
Everything works as of 13th August, after this [https://johnlewis.ie/baytrail-update/ SeaBIOS update] by John Lewis. Latest ChromeOS fw + John Lewis' SeaBIOS has both working suspend and working VPX (kvm)

== Hardware ==
* Intel Celeron N2840 - Dual Core, fanless
* 4 GB RAM (for model CB30-B-104) or 2 GB RAM (for model CB30-B-103)
* 1080p IPS screen (non-touch)
* Elan Touchpad
* 16 GB eMMC card as storage (embedded in mainboard, cannot be replaced)
* SD Card slot
* Intel 7260 AC-Wifi
* Chromebook codename from Google: swanky

== Disclaimer/Prerequisites ==
* You have to open the machine, dismantle and cut off a piece of the heat shield to disable flash write protect.
* You must have enabled developer mode.
* You should have a large SD Card (SDXC UHC-1-type cards seems to work) if you want to use it as a normal laptop, as 16 GB storage can be a tad small. The internal storage cannot be upgraded, it's soldered to the mainboard.
