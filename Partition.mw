There are several ways to give the operating system access to the storage devices, this is a summary of possible methods and combinations of these. As ''Supported OS'' are operating systems listed, which can be booted and installed into partitions or volumes of this type.

=== Master Boot Record (MBR) ===
Used for a long time to organize data, also called DOS-Partitions. Partition information is stored in the MBR of the device.
* widely spread and support in nearly all operating systems
* very well documented
* maximum of 4 primary partitions per device
* maximum size of the device 2TB
* using one as extended partition (of the 4 primary), it is possible to create additional logical partitions to work around the problem of only 4 partitions

==== Programs ====
To create/alter MBR partitions

|}

==== Supported OS ====
* BSD (Mac OS X) - full support
* DOS - full support
* Linux - full support
* Solaris - full support
* Windows - full support

=== GUID Partition Table (GPT) ===
In GUID partition system a small amount of disk space at the beginning of the device is used to store the partition information. Its main advantage is the supported size of storage devices and it creates a backup of the partition table at the end of the device.

* widely spread and support in most modern operating systems
* used to require the [[GRUB2]] bootloader, but the functionality was backported to earlier versions
* maximum of 128 primary partitions per device
* maximum size of the device 9 ZB

==== Programs ====
To create/alter GPT partitions
{| class=wikitable
|-
! Program
! GUI
! Function
|-
| {{Package|sys-apps/gptfdisk}}
| No
| create, remove, alter, resize partitions, convert MBR to GPT, recreate partition tables from backup
|-
| {{Package|sys-block/gparted}}
| Qt/GTK
| create, remove, alter, resize partitions
|}

==== Supported OS ====
* BSD (Mac OS X) - full support
* Linux - full support
* Windows - cannot boot itself, needs the EFI bootloader (Since Server 2008 or Vista SP1)

=== Logical Volume Manager (LVM) ===
[[LVM]] is a complete suite to dynamically manage partitons, storage devices or other underlying systems as volumes.
* widely spread and support in most modern operating systems
* needs [[GRUB2]] bootoader
* maximum size of the device depends on the underlying systems limitations
* maximum size of Logcial Volumes is 8 EB on 64bit Linux and 16TB on 32bit Linux
* storage devices, raid system, network storage (e.g. iSCSI) can be used complete as Physical Volume (no need of partitioning)
* it provides basic forms of redundancy like mirror, raid5 or stripset for performance
{{Note|to use features like dynamic resizing, the used filesystem should be resizeable as well}}

==== Programs ====
The following programs come with {{Package|sys-fs/lvm2}}
{| class=wikitable
|-
! Program
! GUI
! Function
|-
| pvcreate
| No
| create, remove Physical Volumes of storage devices/systems
|-
| vgcreate
| No
| group PV as Volume Group
|-
| lvcreate
| No
| create, remove, alter, resize volumes
|}

==== Supported OS ====
* Linux - full support
{{Note|this is the Linux specific LVM implementation, other OS have their own systems, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Management#Implementations Logical volume management]}}

=== ZFS ===
[[ZFS]] is a complete suite to dynamically manage storage and file system.

* support in Linux (via ZFSOnLinux), Solaris, FreeBSD
* needs [[GRUB2]] bootoader
* maximum size of a single zpool is 256 ZB
* storage devices can be used complete as vdev (no need of partitioning)
* zpools are created once and cannot be resized afterwards. Every volume has access to the full capacity of the zpool, this can be reduzed via quota.
* it provides several forms of redundancy like mirror (also performance), raid5, raid6 or stripset for performance
* comes with its own file system with features like compression, copy on write, deduplication.

==== Programs ====
The following programs come with {{Package|sys-fs/zfs}}
{| class=wikitable
|-
! Program
! GUI
! Function
|-
| zpool
| No
| manage and organize vdevs in zpools
|-
| zfs
| No
| create, remove, alter, resize volumes
|}

==== Supported OS ====
* BSD - full support
* Linux - needs to be build as external module because of the [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/License_Groups/OSI-APPROVED CDDL] and [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/License_Groups/OSI-APPROVED GPL] licence conflict
* Solaris - full support
