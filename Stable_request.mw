This article describes [[Article description::the procedure for moving an ebuild from testing to stable.]]
 
== Responsibility ==

The primary purpose of the stabilization process is to integrate a testing [[ebuild]] into the [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/ Official Gentoo ebuild repository]. This can involve maintaining the consistency of the dependency graph, basic compatibility checks with other packages, and smoke testing of the package itself.

Stabilization is not intended to relieve a package maintainer of their responsibility to ship a quality package - the primary responsibility of ensuring that a package is a good stable candidate remains with the person approving the stabilization request. The stabilization process does not include more than basic functionality checks unless explicitly requested.

== Requesting stabilization ==

Ordinary users can request stabilization, too.

To request stabilization of a package, [https://bugs.gentoo.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gentoo%20Linux file a new bug] under the <code>Stabilization</code> component taking care to complete two special [https://bugs.gentoo.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html bug fields]:

* <code>Package list</code> - a fully qualified package per line, optionally followed by a space-delimited list of architectures to target. If no architecture list is provided, all architectures in <code>CC</code> are assumed. Formerly, this field was called <code>Atoms to stabilize</code> and contained fully qualified atoms, which is also still supported.
* <code>Runtime testing required</code> - indicates if additional runtime testing is should be performed beyond build and tests passing. If ''undefined'' the arch tester should use their best judgement

Examples:

{| class="table table-striped table-condensed sortable"
|-
! scope="row" | Summary
| foo-libs/libbar-1.2.3 stabilization request
|-
! scope="row" | CC
| amd64 x86
|-
! scope="row" | Runtime testing required
| No
|-
! scope="row"| Package list
| foo-libs/libbar-1.2.3 (''old syntax, still supported:'' =foo-libs/libbar-1.2.3)
|-
! scope="row"| Explanation
|
* foo-libs/libbar-1.2.3 will be stabilized for {{keyword|amd64}} and {{keyword|x86}} 
* Build and tests passing is sufficient to stabilize
|}

{| class="table table-striped table-condensed sortable"
|-
! scope="row" | Summary
| app-foo/bar-1.2.3 and app-foo/baz-4.5.6 stabilization request
|-
! scope="row" | CC
| amd64 arm x86
|-
! scope="row" | Runtime testing required
| Yes
|-
! scope="row" rowspan="2" | Package list
| app-foo/bar-1.2.3
|-
| app-foo/baz-4.5.6 amd64 x86
|-
! scope="row" | Explanation
|
* app-foo/bar-1.2.3 will be stabilized for {{keyword|amd64}}, {{keyword|arm}}, and {{keyword|x86}}
* app-foo/baz-4.5.6 will be stabilized for {{keyword|amd64}}, and {{keyword|x86}}
* It is requested additional runtime testing of the package is performed after it is merged
|}

If a large number of atoms are being stabilized at once, it might be preferred to use an attachment to list the atoms instead of the field. In that case, set the flag attachments so that <code>stabilization-list</code> is set to <code>+</code>. If multiple active attachments are flagged they will all be considered, so remove the flag from or mark as obsolete old attachments. If both the atoms field is completed and an attachment is flagged, only the atoms field is considered.

Periodically a bot will review stabilization requests for completeness and complain if there are invalid or missing atoms, setting a <code>sanity-check+</code> or <code>sanity-check-</code> flag as appropriate. This allows arch team members to filter out requests that are not known-good if they wish. A series of architecture-specific [https://bugs.gentoo.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=saved-searches saved searches] are available for convenience.
