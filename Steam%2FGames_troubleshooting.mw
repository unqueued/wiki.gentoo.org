== Steam runtime ==

If the Steam runtime is enabled and some games are not starting (for example Dying Light or Life Is Strange), setting <code>STEAM_RUNTIME_PREFER_HOST_LIBRARIES=0</code> may fix the issue.

== Texture compression ==

Many games, especially those that use the [[Wikipedia:Source_(game_engine)|Source]] engine, require [[Wikipedia:S3_Texture_Compression|S3 Texture Compression (S3TC)]] support. Without S3TC support, these games will usually have black or missing textures, or fail to start.

* Enable S3TC support:

The following USE flags are ''required'' for {{Keyword|amd64}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/steam|1=
media-libs/libtxc_dxtn abi_x86_32
}}

Install the {{Package|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}} package.

{{Emerge|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}}

Next, confirm if S3TC support is enabled with {{c|glxinfo}}, which is provided by the {{Package|x11-apps/mesa-progs}} package:

{{RootCmd|glxinfo {{!}} grep GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc|output=<pre>
    GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
</pre>}}

If S3TC support is not enabled, ensure that the <var>VIDEO_CARDS</var> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} is set to the correct value, and update the video driver to most recent version.

If S3TC support is enabled, but games fail to start with the following error:

<pre>
This system does not support the OpenGL extension GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
</pre>

Force enable S3TC support with:

{{Cmd|force_s3tc_enable{{=}}true steam}}

If [[nouveau]] drivers are being used, installing {{Package|x11-libs/gtkglarea}} may be required to fix the above error.

{{Emerge|x11-libs/gtkglarea}}

== Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel ==

* Gearbox's SHiFT service assumes the underlying distribution is Ubuntu, which stores its SSL certificates in {{Path|/usr/lib/ssl}}, whereas Gentoo (by default) stores them in {{Path|/etc/ssl}}. This difference prevents the redemption of SHiFT codes on Gentoo. To workaround this issue, add <code>SSL_CERT_DIR="/etc/ssl/certs" %command%</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->{Borderlands 2,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel}->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

* If the game is launched but closes almost immediately try adding <code>-nostartupmovies</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->{Borderlands 2,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel}->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

* Additionally the game may still crash at points during game play, when creating a new character or when traveling to one of the DLC's. To workaround this issue edit the {{Path|willowengine.ini}} file. Find the section <code>[FullScreenMovie]</code> and change the value of <var>bForceNoMovies</var> from <code>FALSE</code> to <code>TRUE</code>. The files can be found at {{Path|~/.local/share/aspyr-media/borderlands 2/willowgame/config/willowengine.ini}} and {{Path|~/.local/share/aspyr-media/borderlands the pre-sequel/willowgame/config/willowengine.ini}}.

== Black Mesa ==

* If the game is launched but shows nothing, add <code>LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/<your gcc version number>/32/libstdc++.so.6" %command%</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Black Mesa->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

== Death Road to Canada ==

* Death Road to Canada requires the following USE flags to function correctly and for in-game music:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/steam|1=
media-libs/libsdl2 opengl
media-libs/sdl2-mixer mp3 mad
}}

Rebuild the {{Package|media-libs/libsdl2}} and {{Package|media-libs/sdl2-mixer}} packages:

{{Emerge
|media-libs/libsdl2 media-libs/sdl2-mixer
|params+=--oneshot
}}

Add <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" %command%</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Death Road to Canada->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

== DiRT Showdown ==

* If the launcher fails to start, enable [[Steam/Games troubleshooting#Texture_compression|texture compression]] support<ref>nativemad. [https://github.com/anyc/steam-overlay/issues/159 media-libs/libtxc required from DiRT Showdown], [https://github.com/anyc/steam-overlay anyc's Steam Overlay], January 18th, 2016. Retrieved on January 21st, 2016.</ref>.

* If an [[Intel]] GPU is being used and the launcher fails to start with the following error:

<pre>
Unfortunately your machine doesn't meet the full OpenGL 4.1 requirements so the game may not perform correctly
</pre>

Add <code>MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.1 MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=410 %command%</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->DiRT Showdown->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>. Intel [[Wikipedia:Broadwell_(microarchitecture)|Broadwell]] and [[Wikipedia:Skylake_(microarchitecture)|Skylake]] based GPUs also require <code>INTEL_DEBUG=vec4</code> to be added to the launch options<ref>mahdi1234.

Retrieved on January 21st, 2016.</ref>.

* If an [[Intel]] GPU is being used, the launch options can be removed after upgrading to Mesa 12.0.1.

== Dota 2 ==

* If black textures are visible and an older (<9.1.6) {{Package|media-libs/mesa}} is installed, update {{Package|media-libs/mesa}} to a recent version<ref>Arkady Rost. <!--[https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/683 Black texture]-->Black texture, [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2 Dota 2 Linux and Mac client], August 14th, 2013.

* If a red screen is visible during startup and textures are missing in-game, enable [[Steam/Games troubleshooting#Texture_compression|texture compression]] support<ref>proatx. <!--[https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/1061 Red-screen and no textures]-->Red-screen and no textures, [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2 Dota 2 Linux and Mac client], December 16th, 2013. Retrieved on May 26th, 2015.</ref>.

* If some textures are not clickable (e.g. the character can not move at the fountain when the right mouse button is clicked), [https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335 verify the integrity of the game cache].

== Left 4 Dead 2 ==

* If black textures are visible, enable [[Steam/Games troubleshooting#Texture_compression|texture compression]] support.

== Life Is Strange ==

* If the launcher fails to start, add <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.steam/root/steamapps/common/Life Is Strange/lib/x86_64:$HOME/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/amd64/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$HOME/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/amd64/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu" %command%</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Life Is Strange->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

== Planetary Annihilation: TITANS ==

{{Emerge|media-libs/libsdl2}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
CURL_SSL="gnutls"
}}

{{Emerge|net-misc/curl}}

Planetary Annihilation: TITANS is expecting to find {{Path|libudev.so.o}}. Within the Planetary Annihilation: TITANS runtime directory create a symbolic link to {{Path|/lib/libudev.so.1}}:

{{Cmd|ln -s /lib/libudev.so.1 libudev.so.0}}

== Rust (legacy) ==

* If the launcher fails to start, add <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" %command%</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Rust->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

== Sid Meier's Civilization V ==

* If a black screen is visible and the introduction music is audible during startup, change the value of <var>FSResID</var><ref>Nowaker. [http://steamcommunity.com/app/8930/discussions/1/540744299777007287 Linux: blank/black screen after start - windowed mode maybe?], [http://steamcommunity.com/app/8930 Sid Meier's Civilization V Steam Community], June 12th, 2014. Retrieved on May 28th, 2015.</ref>:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/GraphicsSettingsDX9.ini|1=
FSResID = 7
}}

The correct value for <var>FSResID</var> appears to be system dependent, and may require setting different values before working.

== Starbound ==

* If the launcher fails to start with the following error:

<pre>
This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "xcb".

Available platform plugins are: xcb.

Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
</pre>

Add <code>$(dirname %command%)/starbound</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Starbound->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

== Stealth Bastard Deluxe ==

* If the {{Package|media-fonts/font-misc-misc}} package is not installed, Stealth Bastard Deluxe will segfault<ref>Dirk Meijer. [http://steamcommunity.com/app/209190/discussions/0/810923580565231302 Segmentation Fault in Linux], [http://steamcommunity.com/app/209190 Stealth Bastard Deluxe Steam Community], May 3rd, 2013. Retrieved on May 27th, 2015.</ref>. 

{{Emerge|media-fonts/font-misc-misc}}

Stealth Bastard Deluxe specifically requests the fonts <code>9x15</code>/<code>9x15b</code>, which can be checked for availability with {{Package|x11-apps/xlsfonts}}. Otherwise, add the fonts to the font path, or create a font alias:

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/fonts/misc/fonts.alias|1=
9x15 -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1
9x15B -misc-fixed-bold-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1
}}

== Stellaris ==

Stellaris requires [[Steam/Games troubleshooting#Texture_compression|texture compression]] support.

== Team Fortress 2 ==

* If a black screen is visible for 1-2 seconds, add <code>-nojoy</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Team Fortress 2->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

== Transistor ==

=== Incorrect sound card selected ===

Transistor uses the FMOD engine, which can sometimes detect the wrong default device. Determine the index of the card to be used with <code>aplay -l</code>'s output, then put that index into {{Path|$HOME/.local/share/Transistor/FMODDriver.txt}}. For example, to use the first card detected by ALSA (index 0):

{{Cmd|echo "0" > ~/.local/share/Transistor/FMODDriver.txt}}

Relaunch Transistor and the chosen card should be outputting its sound.

== Unity-based games ==

* Many games that utilize the Unity3D engine released in late 2015 or later either display a black screen for a few seconds and segfault, or run but without sound.<ref>ambidot. [https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/several-unity-games-segfault-at-fmod-failed-to-get-number-of-drivers-when-pulseaudio-isnt-running.369943/ Several Unity games segfault at "FMOD failed to get number of drivers" when PulseAudio isn't running], [https://forum.unity3d.com/ Unity Forums], November 25th, 2015. Retrieved on May 2nd, 2016.</ref> To workaround this issue, disable the Steam runtime for the game by adding <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="" %command%</code> to the game's launch options. It may also be possible to run the game without Steam, but some games will force the use of Steam and keep failing.

* Some games, notably Wasteland 2 Director's Cut, might require PulseAudio to be started manually prior to launching the game, especially on desktop environments which do not have PulseAudio integrated. Torment: Tides of Numenera did not require PulseAudio to be started manually when the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> method above was used.

== X<sup>3</sup>: Terran Conflict and X<sup>3</sup>: Albion Prelude ==

* If red, green and blue stripes are visible, or the launcher fails to start, enable [[Steam/Games troubleshooting#Texture_compression|texture compression]] support<ref>timon37.

== Yooka-Laylee ==

Yooka-Laylee will fail to start if a controller is connected (the game is only really playable with a controller).

{{Cmd
|cd ~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/amd64/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
