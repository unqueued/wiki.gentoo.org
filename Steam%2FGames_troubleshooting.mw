== Texture compression ==

Many games, especially those that use the [[Wikipedia:Source_(game_engine)|Source]] engine, require [[Wikipedia:S3_Texture_Compression|S3 Texture Compression (S3TC)]] support. Without S3TC support, these games will usually have black or missing textures, or fail to start.

* Enable S3TC support:

The following USE flags are ''required'' for {{Keyword|amd64}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/steam|1=
media-libs/libtxc_dxtn abi_x86_32
}}

Install the {{Package|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}} package.

With '''Portage''':

{{Emerge|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}}

With '''Paludis''':

{{RootCmd|cave resolve -z media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}}

Next, confirm if S3TC support is enabled with {{c|glxinfo}}, which is provided by the {{Package|x11-apps/mesa-progs}} package:

{{RootCmd|glxinfo {{!}} grep GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc|output=<pre>
    GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
</pre>}}

If S3TC support is not enabled, ensure that the <var>VIDEO_CARDS</var> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} is set to the correct value, and update the video driver to most recent version.

If S3TC support is enabled, but games fail to start with the following error:

<pre>
This system does not support the OpenGL extension GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
</pre>

Force enable S3TC support with:

{{Cmd|force_s3tc_enable{{=}}true steam}}

If [[nouveau]] drivers are being used, installing {{Package|x11-libs/gtkglarea}} may be required to fix the above error.

With '''Portage''':

{{Emerge|x11-libs/gtkglarea}}

With '''Paludis''':

{{RootCmd|cave resolve -z x11-libs/gtkglarea}}

== Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The PreSequel ==

Gearbox's SHiFT service assumes the GNU/Linux version is running on Ubuntu, which stores its SSL certificates in {{Path|/usr/lib/ssl}}, whereas Gentoo (by default) stores them in {{Path|/etc/ssl}}. Creating a symbolic link corrects this and allows users to redeem SHiFT codes:

{{RootCmd|ln -s /etc/ssl /usr/lib/ssl}}

{{Important|This workaround may have as-of-yet-unknown security implications.}}

== DiRT Showdown ==

* If an [[Intel]] GPU is being used and the launcher fails to start with the following error:

<pre>
Unfortunately your machine doesn't meet the full OpenGL 4.1 requirements so the game may not perform correctly

Add <code>MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.1 MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=410 %command%</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->DiRT Showdown->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>. Intel [[Wikipedia:Broadwell_(microarchitecture)|Broadwell]] and [[Wikipedia:Skylake_(microarchitecture)|Skylake]] based GPUs also require <code>INTEL_DEBUG=vec4</code> to be added to the launch options<ref>mahdi1234.

* If a red screen is visible during startup and textures are missing in-game, enable [[Steam/Games troubleshooting#Texture_compression|texture compression]] support<ref>proatx. <!--[https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/1061 Red-screen and no textures]-->Red-screen and no textures, [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2 Dota 2 Linux and Mac client], December 16th, 2013.

* If some textures are not clickable (e.g. the character can not move at the fountain when the right mouse button is clicked), [https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335 verify the integrity of the game cache].

== Left 4 Dead 2 ==

* If black textures are visible, enbale [[Steam/Games troubleshooting#Texture_compression|texture compression]] support.

== Rust (legacy) ==

* If the launcher fails to start, add <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" %command%</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Rust->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

== Sid Meier's Civilization V ==

* If a black screen is visible and the introduction music is audible during startup, change the value of <var>FSResID</var><ref>Nowaker. [http://steamcommunity.com/app/8930/discussions/1/540744299777007287 Linux: blank/black screen after start - windowed mode maybe?], [http://steamcommunity.com/app/8930 Sid Meier's Civilization V Steam Community], June 12th, 2014. Retrieved on May 28th, 2015.</ref>:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.local/share/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/GraphicsSettingsDX9.ini|1=
FSResID = 7
}}

The correct value for <var>FSResID</var> appears to be system dependent, and may require setting different values before working.

== Starbound ==

* If the launcher fails to start with the following error:

<pre>
This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "xcb".

Available platform plugins are: xcb.

Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
</pre>

Add <code>$(dirname %command%)/starbound</code> to the launch options in <code>Library->Starbound->Properties->General->Set launch options..</code>.

== Stealth Bastard Deluxe ==

* If the {{Package|media-fonts/font-misc-misc}} package is not installed, Stealth Bastard Deluxe will segfault<ref>Dirk Meijer. [http://steamcommunity.com/app/209190/discussions/0/810923580565231302 Segmentation Fault in Linux], [http://steamcommunity.com/app/209190 Stealth Bastard Deluxe Steam Community], May 3rd, 2013.

With '''Portage''':

{{Emerge|media-fonts/font-misc-misc}}

With '''Paludis''':

{{RootCmd|cave resolve -z fonts/font-misc-misc}}

Stealth Bastard Deluxe specifically requests the fonts <code>9x15</code>/<code>9x15b</code>, which can be checked for availability with {{Package|x11-apps/xlsfonts}}. Otherwise, add the fonts to the font path, or create a font alias:

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/fonts/misc/fonts.alias|1=
9x15 -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1

== X<sup>3</sup>: Terran Conflict and X<sup>3</sup>: Albion Prelude ==

* If red, green and blue stripes are visible, or the launcher fails to start, enable [[Steam/Games troubleshooting#Texture_compression|texture compression]] support<ref>timon37.
