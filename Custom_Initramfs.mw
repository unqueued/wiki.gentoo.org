''initramfs'' is a root filesystem which is embedded into the kernel and loaded at an early stage of the boot process. It is the successor of ''initrd''. It provides early userspace which lets you do things that the kernel can't easily do by itself during the boot process.

Using ''initramfs'' is optional. By default, the kernel initializes hardware using built-in drivers, mounts the specified root partition, loads the init system of the installed Linux distribution. The init system then loads additional modules and starts services until it finally allows you to log in. This is a good default behaviour and sufficient for many users. ''initramfs'' is for users with advanced requirements, for users who need to do things as early as possible, before the root partition is mounted.

Here are some examples of what you can do with ''initramfs'':

* Customize the boot process (e.g. print a welcome message, boot splash, ...)
* Load modules (e.g. a third party driver that can not be integrated into the kernel directly)
* Mount the root partition (for encrypted, logical, and otherwise special partitions)
* Provide a minimalistic rescue shell (if something goes wrong)
* Anything the kernel can't do (as long as you can do it in user space, e.g. by executing commands) 

If you don't have advanced requirements, you do not need ''initramfs''.
