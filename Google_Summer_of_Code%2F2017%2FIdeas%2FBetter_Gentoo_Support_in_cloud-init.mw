|Better Gentoo Support in cloud-init|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
cloud-init currently uses a deprecated network back end for Gentoo.  This proposal seeks to convert cloud-init's Gentoo back end to the new back end.  A possible further goal would be to extend systemd support for cloud-init on Gentoo, mainly on the network side.
