{{c|lm_sensors}} is a set of hardware monitoring user space utilities. They are helpful for tracking temperature, fan, and voltage.

== Installation ==

Before {{c|lm_sensors}} will work as intended, the currently running Linux kernel must have the proper modules available to or built-in to the binary in order to give lm_sensors the sensor-related data needed for correct operation. There is a chance these modules have been previously built as modules or are currently included the Kernel's binary (built-in). It is also possible the Kernel is lacking the modules or features. If something is missing then the user will have to take the actions necessary to correct the absence.

In any case a simple hardware detection should be performed using the {{c|sensors-detect}} tool to scan the hardware on the motherboard. Once the hardware has been determined the program will display the output on what is or is not included in the kernel configuration. This step will be performed after installation during the configuration section below.

Another option is to check the [http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/Devices Supported Device List] on the official website. It is possible to enable all drivers and let the {{c|sensors-detect}} program do the work.

=== Kernel ===

[[I2C]] support is needed along with the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable I2C_CHARDEV and hardware Monitoring support in the kernel|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    -*- I2C support  --->
        <*>   I2C device interface
    <*> Hardware Monitoring support  --->

        Select a driver, e.g.:
        [*] Intel Core/Core2/Atom temperature sensor (coretemp)
}}

=== USE flags ===

Portage knows the global USE flag [https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/lm_sensors <code>lm_sensors</code>] for enabling support for {{c|lm_sensors}} in other packages.

Local USE flags include:
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/lm_sensors}}

=== Emerge ===

In case any of the packages having the [https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/lm_sensors <code>lm_sensors</code>] USE flag is installed, set the flag per package in {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/package.use]]}} or globally in {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/make.conf#USE|/etc/portage/make.conf]]}} and update @world so that {{Package|sys-apps/lm_sensors}} will be pulled in as dependency:

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

Otherwise install it directly:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/lm_sensors}}

== Configuration ==

If all drivers were built into the kernel, skip to the next section and proceed with [[#Testing|testing]]. Otherwise configure the modules as needed.

=== Modules ===

{{Warning|Be aware using {{c|sensors-detect}} to probe the hardware in the system may result in a frozen system. Take some ''special caution'' by reading [http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/Documentation the official documentation] before running {{c|lm_sensors}} on '''IBM Thinkpads'''.}}

The {{c|sensors-detect}} ({{Path|/usr/sbin/sensors-detect}}) tool can be used to find available sensors and associated kernel modules:

{{RootCmd|sensors-detect}}

Follow the instructions, it will probe which sensors are available and load the relevant kernel modules.
The final question will allow you to write a config file in {{Path|/etc/modules-load.d}} that contains the kernel modules that need to be loaded. This will only work if the <code>modules-load</code> runscript is started, add it to the <code>default</code> runlevel if necessary.

If you use <code>/etc/conf.d/modules</code> to declare which kernel modules to load simply add the necessary kernel modules as shown by <code>sensors-detect</code> to it.

=== Services ===

==== OpenRC ====

To start {{c|lm_sensors}} on system boot add it the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add lm_sensors default}}

== Usage ==

=== Invocation ===

==== OpenRC ====

Start {{c|lm_sensors}} now by running:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/lm_sensors start}}

=== Testing ===

Now test if everything works:

{{Cmd|sensors|output=<pre>
coretemp-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
Core 0:       +48.0°C  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
Core 1:       +48.0°C  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
</pre>}}
