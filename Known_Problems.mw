This Known Problems page tries to make it more clear towards our end-users which wide spread problems are currently going on in Gentoo Linux, especially with packages coming from the Portage tree. For each problem we know about, we will attempt to document why the problem is happening, which temporary fixes are available and what we are waiting for for it to be resolved; that way users can continue without waiting for certain things to happen. This isn't meant to replace news items, but rather list problems that aren't important enough to be distributed as a news item. It is a community-driven documentation effort, so it may miss things and therefore feel free to help.

== {{anchor|automake_obsolete_macro}} automake 1.13 causes aclocal to fail because AM_CONFIG_HEADER macro is obsolete ==

=== Symptoms ===

Merging [http://bpaste.net/show/94342/ some packages] may lead to a failure of running aclocal:

{{ContentBox|Output|<pre> * Failed Running aclocal !
 * 
 * Include in your bugreport the contents of:
 * 
 *   /var/tmp/portage/app-misc/failing-package-1.2.3/temp/aclocal.out</pre>}}

Upon then inspecting the aclocal.out file you will find the error:

{{ContentBox|Output|<pre>error: 'AM_CONFIG_HEADER': this macro is obsolete</pre>}}

=== Cause ===

As documented at [http://www.flameeyes.eu/autotools-mythbuster/forwardporting/automake.html changes in automake release] the <code>AM_CONFIG_HEADER</code> macro has deprecated in automake 1.13 and has been replaced by <code>AC_CONFIG_HEADERS</code>. This version was in the tree for some time, but it only got recently unmasked and allowed to be used in an eclass.

=== Temporary Fixes ===

* Emerge the failing packages again by appending <code>WANT_AUTOMAKE="1.12"</code> in front, this will cause them to use the previous version:

{{RootCmd|WANT_AUTOMAKE{{=}}"1.12" emerge -1 app-misc/failing-package}}

* Alternatively, you can temporarily mask the new automake and unmerge it if too many packages are failing becaue of it; don't forget to unmask it later.

{{RootCmd|echo "sys-devel/automake:1.13" >> /etc/portage/package.mask
|emerge -C sys-devel/automake:1.13}}

=== Resolution ===

When such a failing package occurs, people should file a bug for that package (make sure none exists already) and block {{Bug|451744}}; that way, maintainers can deal with the problem such that eventually all packages are fixed and then we can upgrade to the version 1.13 of automake. Make sure to provide enough details (emerge --info) and attach the relevant files.

== app-misc/pax-utils-0.5 is blocking sys-kernel/genkernel ==

=== Symptons ===

When you try to <code>emerge genkernel</code> you get output similar to the following:

{{ContentBox|Output|<pre>[ebuild     UD ] app-misc/pax-utils-0.5 [0.7]
[ebuild  N     ] sys-kernel/genkernel-3.4.45  USE="-crypt -cryptsetup (-ibm) (-selinux)" 
[blocks B      ] =app-misc/pax-utils-0.5 ("=app-misc/pax-utils-0.5" is blocking sys-kernel/genkernel-3.4.45)

 * Error: The above package list contains packages which cannot be
 * installed at the same time on the same system.

  (sys-kernel/genkernel-3.4.45::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge) pulled in by
    genkernel

  (app-misc/pax-utils-0.5::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge) pulled in by
    >=app-misc/pax-utils-0.1.17 required by (sys-apps/portage-2.1.11.62::gentoo, installed)
    <app-misc/pax-utils-0.6 required by (sys-kernel/genkernel-3.4.45::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge)
    >=app-misc/pax-utils-0.2.1 required by (sys-kernel/genkernel-3.4.45::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge)</pre>}}

=== Cause ===

lddtree, a recursive version of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldd_(Unix) ldd] has changed its output format; this has been reported in {{Bug|450688}}. Genkernel, as a result, is unable to parse this new format since it hasnn't been adapted to it yet. To avoid the new lddtree being installed together with genkernel, a blocker is in place.

=== Temporary Fixes ===

This can be temporarily fixed by masking the versions of pax-utils where the output has changed, then emerge genkernel again:

{{RootCmd|echo ">{{=}}app-misc/pax-utils-0.5" >> /etc/portage/package.mask
|emerge -C sys-kernel/genkernel}}

Don't forget to remove the mask once the bug is resolved.

=== Resolution ===

Wait for {{Bug|450688}} to resolve, which requires the genkernel maintainers to correct the parsing; this may take some time as the genkernel team is undermanned, help is welcome.
