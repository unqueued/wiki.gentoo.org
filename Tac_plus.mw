From the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TACACS%2B TACACS+ article] at Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:
:In computer networking, TACACS+ (''Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus'') is a Cisco Systems proprietary protocol which provides access control for routers, network access servers and other networked computing devices via one or more centralized servers. TACACS+ provides separate authentication, authorization and accounting services.

TACACS+ is a protocol for AAA services (Authentication, Authorisation, Accounting), very similar to RADIUS. 
A system that provides logins to users is often called a NAS (Network Access Server), not to be confused with NAS - (Network Attached Storage). A NAS can be a ''client'' to an ''AAA server'', such as a  RADIUS, LDAP, or TACACS server. The client must use the authentication protocol appropriate for the server. A Linux system may act as an authentication client when when logging in a user. Based on the PAM configuration, the Linux system can use a RADIUS, LDAP, or TACACS server or may perform purely local authentication. To use TACACS, the Linux (or other) client must have IP access to a '''TACACS server''', which is usually a separate physical server that provides authentication services to many clients. This page describes how to configure a Linux system to act as a TACACS server using the '''tac plus''' software package. It is often useful to have a TACACS server to support authentication for proprietary systems on your network, such as Cisco routers, that implement TACACS clients. With such a server, you can add or delete a new router administrator on all of your routers at the same time in one place. If some of your Linux systems are acting as network elements that should be accessed only by your network administrators, you may choose to configure these systems to also use your TACACS server for AAA.

== About ==
This document describes how to configure and use the most recent version of tac_plus provided by [http://www.shrubbery.net/tac_plus/ Shrubbery Networks].

This installation howto uses tac_plus-4.0.4.19 as reference. General configuration and troubleshooting tips should also apply to older tac_plus versions available in the portage.
(tac_plus-4.0.4.14, tac_plus-4.0.4.15).

== Installation ==
The following USE flags are supported by the {{Package|net-nds/tac_plus}} package.
{{USEflag
|package=net-nds/tac_plus
|debug
|finger++yes
|maxsess
|skey++yes
|static-libs
|tcpd++yes
}}

Enable the recommended USE flags and install the package.
{{Emerge|net-nds/tac_plus}}

== Configuration ==
Shrubbery tac_plus is lacking a good documentation. 
General configuration is split up in 3 main sections:

* ACL (Access Lists)
* group 
* users

{{Important|The sequence ACL, groups, users in the file /etc/tac_plus/tac_plus.conf is important}}
Further configuration tips at [http://www.shrubbery.net/tac_plus/FAQ tac_plus FAQ]

Ways to configure user authentication with tac_plus:
* Authentication to local passwd file '''/etc/passwd'''
* Authentication to LDAP server with '''PAM'''
* Authentication to password configured in '''/etc/tac_plus/tac_plus.conf'''

User authentication with '''/etc/passwd''' example:

{{File|/etc/tac_plus/tac_plus.conf||<pre>
key = 123-my_tacacs_key

group = netadmin {
        default service = permit
        login = file /etc/passwd
        service = exec {
                priv-lvl = 15
                }
}

user = jimi {
        member = netadmin
}
</pre>
}}

{{Note|tac_plus versions to 4.0.4.19 supports only user authentication with LDAP. Group membership has to be defined in tac_plus configuration file.}}

User authentication with '''PAM''' example:

{{File|/etc/tac_plus/tac_plus.conf||<pre>
key = 123-my_tacacs_key

group = netadmin {
        default service = permit
        service = exec {
                priv-lvl = 15
                }
}

user = jimi {
        login = PAM
        member = netadmin
}
</pre>
}}

== Network equipment configuration ==
A variety of systems implements the client side of the TACACS+ protocol. The following companies implement TACACS+ protocol communication support for some or all products:
* Cisco (IOS, CatOS)
* Juniper (ScreenOS, JUNOS)
* Huawei
* HP
* OneAccess
* Linux-based systems (via PAM)

Basic AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) configuration on a cisco IOS component.
* substitute ''tacacs-server'' host with IP address of the tac_plus server
* For ''key'' choose the key which is configured in '''/etc/tac_plus/tac_plus.conf'''

<pre>
!
aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local
aaa authentication enable default group tacacs+
aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ local
!
tacacs-server host 192.168.255.254 key 123-my_tacacs_key
!
line con 0
 login authentication default
!
line vty 0 15
 login authentication default
!
</pre>

== Final configuration steps ==
Start tac_plus daemon: 
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/tac_plus start}}

Add tac_plus to the default runlevel: 
{{RootCmd|rc-update add tac_plus default}}

Verify tac_plus is running: 
{{RootCmd|<nowiki>ps -ef |grep tac_plus</nowiki>
|output=<pre>
root      8123     1  0 21:29 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/tac_plus -C /etc/tac_plus/tac_plus.conf
</pre>
}}

== Troubleshooting ==
Verifying the interfaces and ports on which tac_plus is listening:
{{RootCmd|<nowiki>netstat -tulpen | grep tac_plus</nowiki>
|output=<pre>
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:49              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          27930913   8455/tac_plus
</pre>
}}

Looking for configuration errors if daemon fails to start:
{{RootCmd|tail -f /var/log/messages
|output=<pre>
2011-04-09T21:26:28.847493+02:00 server tac_plus[7749]: Reading config

}}

Tacacs communication between tacacs-server and a network component. Example output of a a successful user session:
Run tcpdump on the local tacacs-server:
