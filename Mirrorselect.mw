{{Lowercase title}}

The {{c|mirrorselect}} program provides a nice interface to select [https://www.gentoo.org/support/rsync-mirrors/ Gentoo rsync mirror] and [https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/ Gentoo source mirrors].

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-portage/mirrorselect}}:

{{Emerge|app-portage/mirrorselect}}

== Usage ==

=== Select the Gentoo rsync mirror ===

The default configuration of repositories for Portage comes from the Portage package itself at {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}. However settings in {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf]]}} override values set {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}.

{{c|mirrorselect}} will not create the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf]]}} file automatically. If it does not exist, it will default to the using the old {{Path|make.conf}} <var>[[SYNC]]</var> variable which has been deprecated. If it does not exist make sure Portage is up to date and copy the rsync.conf file from Portage's {{Path|/usr}} (library) location to the {{Path|/etc}} (configuration) location:

{{Emerge|params+=--update|sys-apps/portage}}

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /etc/portage/repos.conf
|cp /usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf
}}

{{Note|For additional {{Path|repos.conf}} documentation and configuration please refer to  [[Project:Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration|Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration]]}}

Then proceed with using the {{c|mirrorselect}} utility.

* Find a [https://www.gentoo.org/support/rsync-mirrors/ Gentoo rsync mirror] (make sure to use <code>sync-type = rsync</code>):

: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -r -o >> [[:/etc/portage/repos.conf#Main_Gentoo_repository|/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf]]}}


Just navigate to the mirrors of choice and press {{Key|Space}} to select one (or more) mirrors.

=== Select the Gentoo source mirror(s) ===

* Find [https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/ Gentoo source mirrors] (set <var>[[GENTOO_MIRRORS]]</var> variable):

: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -o >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

* Find 3 fastest servers by downloading 100K from each. This command will use all available mirrors in the list:

: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s3 -b10 -D}}

=== Options ===

Please consider using one of these additional options to limit the available mirrors in the list it tests.

Server type selection (choose at most one):

{{GenericCmd|
     -c COUNTRY, -country COUNTRY
                        only use mirrors from the specified country NOTE:
                        Names with a space must be quoted eg.:  -c 'South
