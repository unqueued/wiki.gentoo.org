{{Warning|Note that the [[SYNC|SYNC]] variable is now deprecated, and instead the <code>sync-type</code> and <code>sync-uri</code> attributes in {{Path|/etc/portage/repos.conf}} should be used. See the [[:/etc/portage/repos.conf|/etc/portage/repos.conf article]] or the [[Portage|Portage article]] for more information.}}

<tt>mirrorselect</tt> provides a nice interface to select the mirrors you want.

== Installation ==

Install {{Package|app-portage/mirrorselect}}:

{{Emerge|app-portage/mirrorselect}}

== Usage ==

The default configuration  of repositories for Portage comes from the Portage package itself at {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}. However settings in {{Path|/etc/portage/repos.conf}} override values set {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}.

<tt>mirrorselect</tt> will not create the {{Path|/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf}} file automatically. If it does not exist, it will default to the using the old {{Path|make.conf}} <code>SYNC</code> setting which has been deprecated. If it does not exist:

{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/portage/repos.conf}}
{{RootCmd|cp /usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf}}

{{Note| For additional repos.conf documentation and configuration please refer to:
 [[Project:Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration|Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration]]}}
Then proceed with using the <tt>mirrorselect</tt> utility.

Just navigate to the mirrors of choice and press {{Key|Space}} to select one (or more) mirrors.

* Find Gentoo download mirror (set <code>[[GENTOO_MIRRORS]]</code> variable):
: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -o >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

* Find a Gentoo rsync mirror:
: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -r}}

* Find 3 fastest servers by downloading 100K from each. This command will use all available mirrors in the list:

: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s3 -b10 -D}}

Please consider using one of these additional options to limit the available mirrors in the list it tests.

Server type selection (choose at most one):

{{GenericCmd|
     -c COUNTRY, -country COUNTRY
                        only use mirrors from the specified country NOTE:
                        Names with a space must be quoted eg.:  -c 'South
                        Korea'
    -F, --ftp           ftp only mode. Will not consider hosts of other types.
    -H, --http          http only mode. Will not consider hosts of other types
    -r, --rsync         rsync mode. Allows you to interactively select your
                        rsync mirror. Requires -i or -a to be used.
     -R REGION, -region REGION
                        only use mirrors from the specified region NOTE: Names
