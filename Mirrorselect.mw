The {{c|mirrorselect}} program provides a nice interface to set the <var>[[GENTOO_MIRRORS]]</var> variable and the [https://www.gentoo.org/support/rsync-mirrors/ Gentoo rsync mirror].

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-portage/mirrorselect}}:

{{Emerge|app-portage/mirrorselect}}

== Usage ==

=== Select the Gentoo source mirror(s) ===

* Find [https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/ Gentoo source mirrors] (and set or update the <var>[[GENTOO_MIRRORS]]</var> variable):
A dialog will appear where the available mirrors can be selected. On save {{path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} will be backed up and written.

{{RootInvocation|mirrorselect -i|output=<pre>
* Modifying /etc/portage/make.conf with new mirrors...
        Reading make.conf
        Moving to /etc/portage/make.conf.backup
        Writing new /etc/portage/make.conf
* Done.
</pre>}}

* This example selects source mirrors only from country USA and adds a new <var>[[GENTOO_MIRRORS]]=</var> line to {{path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}:

{{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -c USA -o >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

* Find 3 fastest servers by downloading 100K from each. This command will use all available mirrors in the list:

: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s3 -b10 -D}}

=== Options ===

Please consider using one of these additional options to limit the available mirrors in the list it tests.

Server type selection:

{{GenericCmd|
     -c COUNTRY, -country COUNTRY
                        only use mirrors from the specified country NOTE:
                        Names with a space must be quoted eg.:  -c 'South
                        Korea'
    -F, --ftp           ftp only mode. Will not consider hosts of other types.
    -H, --http          http only mode. Will not consider hosts of other types
    -r, --rsync         rsync mode. Allows you to interactively select your
                        rsync mirror. Requires -i or -a to be used.
     -R REGION, -region REGION
                        only use mirrors from the specified region NOTE: Names
                        with a space must be quoted eg.:  -R 'North America'
    -4, --ipv4          only use IPv4
    -6, --ipv6          only use IPv6
}}

=== Select the Gentoo rsync mirror ===

{{Note|[https://www.gentoo.org/support/rsync-mirrors/ Gentoo documentation] states:<br /><br />
<cite>Gentoo is hosted by many mirrors around the globe. Selecting a mirror that is geographically near you may help speed up Portage tree updates. </cite>}}

{{Note|But [[Handbook:Parts/Installation/Base#Main Gentoo repository|Gentoo handbook]] recommends to keep default settings:<br /><br />
<cite>The default <var>sync-uri</var> variable value listed above will determine a mirror location based on a rotation. This will aid in easing bandwidth stress on Gentoo's infrastructure and will provide a fail safe in case a specific mirror is offline. It is recommended the default URI is kept.</cite>

<cite>For those who wish to choose a single mirror in a closer geographic region, a text editor can be used to change the default value. Again, this is not recommended, but can be done if necessary. This can be especially useful for those who use Gentoo in a private company or a large-scale corporate environment.
</cite>}}

The default configuration of the [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/ Gentoo repository] comes from {{package|sys-apps/portage}} and is located at {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}. However settings in {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf]]}} override it.

{{c|mirrorselect}} will not create the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf]]}} file automatically. If that file does not exist, {{c|mirrorselect}} will default to using the old {{Path|make.conf}} <var>[[SYNC]]</var> variable which has been deprecated. In order to avoid this make sure Portage is up to date and copy the {{Path|repos.conf}} file from Portage's {{Path|/usr}} (library) location to the {{Path|/etc}} (configuration) location:

{{Emerge|params+=--update|sys-apps/portage}}

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /etc/portage/repos.conf
|cp /usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf
}}

{{Note|For additional {{Path|repos.conf}} documentation and configuration please refer to  [[Project:Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration|Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration]]}}

Then proceed with using the {{c|mirrorselect}} utility.

* Find a [https://www.gentoo.org/support/rsync-mirrors/ Gentoo rsync mirror] (make sure to use <code>sync-type = rsync</code>):

: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -r -o >> [[:/etc/portage/repos.conf#Main_Gentoo_repository|/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf]]}}

Just navigate to the mirrors of choice and press {{Key|Space}} to select one (or more) mirrors.
