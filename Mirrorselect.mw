{{path|/etc/portage/repos.conf}} should be used. See portage(5) for more information.}}

{{Lowercase title}}
'''mirrorselect''' provides a nice interface to select the mirrors you want.

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|app-portage/mirrorselect}}:
{{Emerge|mirrorselect}}

== Usage ==
The  default  configuration  of repositories for Portage comes from the portage package itself at: {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}. However settings in {{Path|/etc/portage/repos.conf}} override values set {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}.

Mirrorselect will not create the {{Path|/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf}} file for you.  If it does not exist, it will default to the using the old make.conf SYNC= setting which is now deprecated.  So, if it does not exist...

: {{RootCmd|cp /usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf}}

Then proceed with using mirrorselect.

Just navigate to the mirrors of choice and press {{Key|Space}} to select one or more mirrors.

* Find Gentoo download mirror (set [[GENTOO_MIRRORS|GENTOO_MIRRORS variable]]):
: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -o >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

* Find Gentoo rsync mirror:
: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -r}}

* Find 3 fastest servers by downloading 100K from each:

This uses all available mirrors in the list
: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s3 -b10 -D}}

But please consider using one of these additional options to limit the available mirrors in the list it tests.
