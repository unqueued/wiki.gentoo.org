{{Lowercase title}}
'''mirrorselect''' provides a nice interface to select the mirrors you want.

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|app-portage/mirrorselect}}:
{{Emerge|mirrorselect}}

== Usage ==
The  default  configuration  of repositories for Portage comes from the portage package itself at: {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}. However settings in {{Path|/etc/portage/repos.conf}} override values set {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}.

Just navigate to the mirrors of choice and press {{Key|Space}} to select one or more mirrors.

* Find Gentoo download mirror (set [[GENTOO_MIRRORS|GENTOO_MIRRORS variable]]):
: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -o >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

* Find Gentoo rsync mirror:
: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -r -o >> /etc/portage/repos.conf}}

* Find 3 fastest servers by downloading 100K from each:
: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s3 -b10 -o -D >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}
