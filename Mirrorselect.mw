The {{c|mirrorselect}} program provides a nice interface to set the <var>[[GENTOO_MIRRORS]]</var> variable and the [https://www.gentoo.org/support/rsync-mirrors/ Gentoo rsync mirror].

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-portage/mirrorselect}}:

{{Emerge|app-portage/mirrorselect}}

== Usage ==

=== Select the Gentoo rsync mirror ===

The default configuration of the [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/ Gentoo repository] comes from {{package|sys-apps/portage}} and is located at {{Path|/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf}}. However settings in {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf]]}} override it.

{{c|mirrorselect}} will not create the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf]]}} file automatically. If that file does not exist, {{c|mirrorselect}} will default to using the old {{Path|make.conf}} <var>[[SYNC]]</var> variable which has been deprecated. In order to avoid this make sure Portage is up to date and copy the repos.conf file from Portage's {{Path|/usr}} (library) location to the {{Path|/etc}} (configuration) location:

{{Emerge|params+=--update|sys-apps/portage}}

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /etc/portage/repos.conf
|cp /usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf
}}

{{Note|For additional {{Path|repos.conf}} documentation and configuration please refer to  [[Project:Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration|Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration]]}}

Then proceed with using the {{c|mirrorselect}} utility.

* Find a [https://www.gentoo.org/support/rsync-mirrors/ Gentoo rsync mirror] (make sure to use <code>sync-type = rsync</code>):

: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -r -o >> [[:/etc/portage/repos.conf#Main_Gentoo_repository|/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf]]}}

Just navigate to the mirrors of choice and press {{Key|Space}} to select one (or more) mirrors.

=== Select the Gentoo source mirror(s) ===

* Find [https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/ Gentoo source mirrors] (and set or update the <var>[[GENTOO_MIRRORS]]</var> variable):
A dialog will appear where the available mirrors can be selected. On save {{path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} will be backuped and written.

{{RootInvocation|mirrorselect -i|output=<pre>
* Modifying /etc/portage/make.conf with new mirrors...
        Reading make.conf
        Moving to /etc/portage/make.conf.backup
        Writing new /etc/portage/make.conf
* Done.
</pre>}}

* Select source mirrors only from country USA and add a new <var>[[GENTOO_MIRRORS]]=</var> line to {{path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}:

{{RootCmd|mirrorselect -i -c USA -o >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

* Find 3 fastest servers by downloading 100K from each. This command will use all available mirrors in the list:

: {{RootCmd|mirrorselect -s3 -b10 -D}}

=== Options ===

Please consider using one of these additional options to limit the available mirrors in the list it tests.

Server type selection (choose at most one):

{{GenericCmd|
     -c COUNTRY, -country COUNTRY
                        only use mirrors from the specified country NOTE:
                        Names with a space must be quoted eg.:  -c 'South
                        Korea'
    -F, --ftp           ftp only mode. Will not consider hosts of other types.
    -H, --http          http only mode. Will not consider hosts of other types
    -r, --rsync         rsync mode. Allows you to interactively select your
                        rsync mirror. Requires -i or -a to be used.
     -R REGION, -region REGION
                        only use mirrors from the specified region NOTE: Names
                        with a space must be quoted eg.:  -R 'North America'
