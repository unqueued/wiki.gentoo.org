OpenRC has developed itself and has gained some new features. In this article two features are highlighted:

* openrc-init, is OpenRC's own [[init system]], and can act as a replacement for [[sysvinit]], and 
* supervise-daemon, which can supervise daemon processes. Supervise-daemon could replace start-stop-daemon, which is used by quite a few services.

{{Warning|In the source code of the current version of supervise-daemon it is still stated that it is '''experimental'''. Use supervise-daemon at own risk.}}
