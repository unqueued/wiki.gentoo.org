<!--T:2-->
To quote [http://xfce.org/ xfce.org]: "Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly."

== Installation == <!--T:3-->

=== Avoiding unnecessary dependencies === <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
Avoiding optional GNOME support and packages will keep the system more lean and congruous. This section is entirely optional; proceed in this manner if the goal is to keep the system small(er) rather than large(r).

<!--T:71-->
Ensure that the system is using the basic "desktop" [[Profile (Portage)|profile]]:

<!--T:7-->
{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|output=<pre>
Available profile symlink targets:
  [1]   default/linux/amd64/13.0 *
  [2]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
  [3]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop
  [4]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
  [5]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd
  [6]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde
  [7]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde/systemd
  [8]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/developer
  [9]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/no-multilib
  [10]  default/linux/amd64/13.0/systemd
  [11]  default/linux/amd64/13.0/x32
  [12]  hardened/linux/amd64
  [13]  hardened/linux/amd64/selinux
  [14]  hardened/linux/amd64/no-multilib
  [15]  hardened/linux/amd64/no-multilib/selinux
  [16]  hardened/linux/amd64/x32
  [17]  hardened/linux/musl/amd64
  [18]  default/linux/uclibc/amd64
  [19]  hardened/linux/uclibc/amd64
</pre>}}

<!--T:8-->
Use one that ends with {{Path|/desktop}} (and not {{Path|/gnome}} or {{Path|/kde}}):

<!--T:9-->
{{RootCmd|eselect profile set 3}}

<!--T:10-->
{{Package|app-text/poppler}} and {{Package|dev-util/cmake}} listen to the <code>qt4</code> and/or <code>qt5</code> USE flag. Disable it so that these packages do not pull in the huge Qt package set:

<!--T:11-->
{{FileBox|title=Do not set qt4 and qt5 USE flags for poppler and cmake|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/xfce|1=
app-text/poppler -qt4 -qt5
dev-util/cmake -qt4 -qt5
}}

<!--T:12-->
Of course, <code>-qt4</code> and <code>-qt5</code> can also be set globally in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} if one desires.

=== Setting XFCE_PLUGINS === <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
In {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}, add and customize the <var>XFCE_PLUGINS</var> variable:

<!--T:17-->
<!-- Not using lang=bash as the underscore in XFCE_PLUGINS then disappears -->
{{FileBox|title=Setting XFCE_PLUGINS|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|1=
XFCE_PLUGINS="brightness clock trash"
}}

<!--T:18-->
The above options may change; the current list is available inside [http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/profiles/desc/xfce_plugins.desc?view=markup ${PORTDIR}/profiles/desc/xfce_plugins.desc].

=== Emerge === <!--T:19-->

<!--T:20-->
It is time to install the complete Xfce desktop!

<!--T:72-->
Without explicitly including {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}} in the {{c|emerge}} command, {{Package|virtual/notification-daemon}} will draw in GNOME's {{Package|x11-misc/notification-daemon}} instead. So install it together with {{Package|xfce-base/xfce4-meta}} and later deselect it so it is not included in the world file:

<!--T:21-->
{{Emerge|xfce-base/xfce4-meta xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}}

<!--T:22-->
{{Emerge|params+=--deselect{{=}}y|xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}}

<!--T:23-->
Of course, it is also possible to select only needed packages:

<!--T:24-->
{{Emerge|xfce-base/xfwm4 xfce-base/xfce4-panel}}

== Configuration == <!--T:25-->

=== Display managers === <!--T:27-->

<!--T:28-->
It is possible to use a display manager to start Xfce. Please refer to the [[display manager]] article to configure a display manager.

<!--T:29-->
Most display managers use {{Path|*.desktop}} files to configure available sessions. The following is an example desktop file:

<!--T:30-->
{{FileBox|title=Xfce4 desktop file for display managers|filename=xfce4.desktop|lang=ini|1=
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Xfce4
Comment=Use this session to run Xfce 4 as desktop environment
Exec=/usr/bin/startxfce4
Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/xfce4_xicon1.png
Type=Application
}}

<!--T:31-->
The desktop file can be placed in the right location for the display manager.

=== Starting Xfce without a display manager === <!--T:73-->

<!--T:74-->
{{c|startx}} and {{c|startxfce4}} are two of the [[X without Display Manager|readily available options]] for starting Xfce without using a display manager.

==== startx ==== <!--T:32-->

<!--T:33-->
When using {{c|startx}}, create a {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} file with the following contents:

<!--T:34-->
{{FileBox|title=Starting xfce4 when invoking startx|filename=~/.xinitrc|1=
exec startxfce4
}}

==== startxfce4 ==== <!--T:35-->

<!--T:36-->
To launch the Xfce4 desktop simply type {{c|startxfce4}} at the command-line and press enter:

<!--T:37-->
{{Cmd|startxfce4}}

== Advanced configuration == <!--T:38-->

<!--T:39-->
Xfce is a desktop environment and as such can be tuned and tailored to the needs of (almost) every user. In this section, a number of popular (or more challenging) aspects are covered.

=== Volume keys === <!--T:40-->

==== xfce4-volumed ==== <!--T:41-->

<!--T:42-->
Install {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed}} to manage the volume keys:

<!--T:43-->
{{Emerge|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed}}

<!--T:44-->
When using pulseaudio with xfce4, use {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed-pulse}}:

<!--T:45-->
{{Emerge|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed-pulse}}

==== Keyboard shortcuts ==== <!--T:46-->

<!--T:47-->
Run {{c|xfce4-keyboard-settings}} to bind the following keys:

<!--T:48-->
* {{Key|volume up}} button: amixer set Master 5%+
* {{Key|volume down}} button: amixer set Master 5%-
* {{Key|mute}} button: amixer set Master toggle

=== Consistent GTK+ 3 themes === <!--T:49-->

==== Native Xfce theme engine ==== <!--T:50-->

<!--T:51-->
Xfce's own theme engine, {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}}, was updated in version 3.0, which implements native support for GTK+ 3 with no further configuration.

<!--T:52-->
Assuming that the <code>gtk3</code> USE flag is set, the GTK+ 3 version (revision 300 or higher) should be pulled in by default if {{Package|xfce-base/xfce4-meta}} or {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}} were installed with a <code>--deep</code> world upgrade.

<!--T:53-->
If not simply:

<!--T:54-->
{{Emerge|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}}

<!--T:55-->
This should pull in the right version of {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}} through the use of a specific <code>SLOT</code>.

<!--T:56-->
After emerging the GTK+ 3 version of {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}}, applications using GTK+ 3 should now blend nicely with applications using GTK+ 2 when one of the native Xfce themes is used.

==== Greybird theme ==== <!--T:57-->

<!--T:58-->
Another option is to use the [http://shimmerproject.org/project/greybird/ Greybird] theme, which has support for GTK+ 2, GTK+ 3, xfwm4, emerald, and metacity:

<!--T:59-->
{{Emerge|x11-themes/greybird}}

<!--T:60-->
Go to {{Path|Xfce menu}} -> {{Path|Settings}} -> {{Path|Appearance}}. Or run {{c|xfce4-appearance-settings}}. Select "Greybird" from the "Style" list.

<!--T:61-->
Now GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3 applications should have a consistent look.

=== Other themes === <!--T:62-->

<!--T:63-->
Other themes available in Portage that are compatible with XFCE can be emerged with the following list:

<!--T:64-->
{{Emerge|x11-themes/clearlooks-phenix x11-themes/gnome-themes-standard x11-themes/gtk-engines-aurora x11-themes/light-themes x11-themes/murrine-themes x11-themes/nimbus x11-themes/oxygen-molecule x11-themes/redhat-artwork x11-themes/shiki-colors x11-themes/tactile3 x11-themes/zukini}}

=== Additional applications === <!--T:65-->

<!--T:66-->
There are a number of additional applications which are either part of Xfce or support this desktop environment nicely.

<!--T:67-->

== Troubleshooting == <!--T:71-->

=== Program starting hotkeys are not working / Colors not changeable from appearance ===

Hotkeys, that are in charge of starting application, and not behavior are not working:

* {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|Alt}} {{Key|D}} is '''working''' -> toggle desktop
* {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|F2}} '''not working''' -> run application (but is available through menus)

Consolekit is not running:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/consolekit start}}

{{RootCmd|rc-update add consolekit default}}

It will also start up dbus. After restarting X enjoy the new hotkeys and colors.
