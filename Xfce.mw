To quote [http://xfce.org/ xfce.org], Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.

== Installation ==

=== Avoiding unnecessary dependencies ===

Avoiding optional GNOME support and packages will keep the system more lean and congruous.

Ensure that the system is using the basic "desktop" [[profile]]:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|output=<pre>
Available profile symlink targets:
  [1]   default/linux/amd64/13.0 *
  [2]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
  [3]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop
  [4]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
  [5]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd
  [6]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde
  [7]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/kde/systemd
  [8]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/developer
  [9]   default/linux/amd64/13.0/no-multilib
  [10]  default/linux/amd64/13.0/systemd
  [11]  default/linux/amd64/13.0/x32
  [12]  hardened/linux/amd64
  [13]  hardened/linux/amd64/selinux
  [14]  hardened/linux/amd64/no-multilib
  [15]  hardened/linux/amd64/no-multilib/selinux
  [16]  hardened/linux/amd64/x32
  [17]  hardened/linux/musl/amd64
  [18]  default/linux/uclibc/amd64
  [19]  hardened/linux/uclibc/amd64
</pre>}}

Use one that ends with {{Path|/desktop}} (and not {{Path|/gnome}} or {{Path|/kde}}):

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set 3}}

{{Package|app-text/poppler}} and {{Package|dev-util/cmake}} listen to the <code>qt4</code> USE flag. Disable it so that these packages do not pull in the huge Qt4 package set:

{{FileBox|title=Do not set qt4 USE flag for poppler and cmake|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/xfce|1=
app-text/poppler -qt4
dev-util/cmake -qt4
}}

Of course, <code>-qt4</code> can also be set globally in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.

{{Package|gnome-base/gvfs}} has an <code>http</code> USE flag which draws in many GNOME deps that may be unnecessary:

{{FileBox|title=Do not set the http USE flag for gvfs|filename=/etc/portage/package.use/xfce|1=
gnome-base/gvfs -http
}}

=== Setting XFCE_PLUGINS ===

In {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}, add and customize the <code>XFCE_PLUGINS</code> variable:

<!-- Not using lang=bash as the underscore in XFCE_PLUGINS then disappears -->
{{FileBox|title=Setting XFCE_PLUGINS|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|1=
XFCE_PLUGINS="brightness clock trash"
}}

The above options may change; the current list is available inside [http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/profiles/desc/xfce_plugins.desc?view=markup ${PORTDIR}/profiles/desc/xfce_plugins.desc].

=== Software installation ===

Install the complete Xfce desktop. Without explicitly including {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}} in the <tt>emerge</tt> command, {{Package|virtual/notification-daemon}} will draw in GNOME's {{Package|x11-misc/notification-daemon}} instead. So install it together with {{Package|xfce-base/xfce4-meta}} and later deselect it so it is not included in the world file anymore:

{{Emerge|xfce-base/xfce4-meta xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}}

{{RootCmd|emerge --deselect{{=}}y xfce4-notifyd}}

Of course, it is also possible to select only needed packages:

{{Emerge|xfwm4 xfce4-panel}}

== Configuration ==

To start Xfce it is possible to use a [[display manager]], <tt>startx</tt>, or <tt>startxfce4</tt>.

=== Display manager ===

Please refer to the [[Display_manager]] article to select and configure a display manager.

Most display managers use {{Path|*.desktop}} files to configure available sessions. An example desktop file is shown next:

{{FileBox|title=Xfce4 desktop file for display managers|filename=xfce4.desktop|lang=ini|1=
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Xfce4
Comment=Use this session to run Xfce 4 as desktop environment
Exec=/usr/bin/startxfce4
Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/xfce4_xicon1.png
Type=Application
}}

The desktop file can be placed in the right location for the display manager.

=== Using startx ===

When using <tt>startx</tt>, create a {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} file with the following contents:

{{FileBox|title=Starting xfce4 when invoking startx|filename=~/.xinitrc|1=
exec startxfce4
}}

=== Using startxfce4 ===

To launch the Xfce4 desktop, just type in <tt>startxfce4</tt>.

{{Cmd|startxfce4}}

== Advanced Configuration ==

Xfce is a desktop environment and as such can be tuned and tailored to the needs of (almost) every user. In this section, a number of popular (or more challenging) aspects are covered.

=== Volume keys ===

==== xfce4-volumed ====

Install {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed}} to manage the volume keys:

{{Emerge|xfce4-volumed}}

When using pulseaudio with xfce4, use {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed-pulse}}:

{{Emerge|xfce4-volumed-pulse}}

==== Keyboard shortcuts ====

Run <tt>xfce4-keyboard-settings</tt> to bind the following keys:

* {{Key|volume up}} button: amixer set Master 5%+
* {{Key|volume down}} button: amixer set Master 5%-
* {{Key|mute}} button: amixer set Master toggle

=== Consistent GTK+ 3 themes ===

==== Native Xfce theme engine ====

Xfce's own theme engine, {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}}, was recently updated to version 3.0, which implements native support for GTK+ 3 with no further configuration.

Assuming that the <code>gtk3</code> USE flag is set, the GTK+ 3 version (revision 300 or higher) should be pulled in by default if {{Package|xfce-base/xfce4-meta}} or {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}} were installed with a <code>--deep</code> world upgrade.

If not, simply do:

{{Emerge|gtk-engines-xfce}}

This should pull in the right version of {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}} through the use of a specific <code>SLOT</code>.

After emerging the GTK+ 3 version of {{Package|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}}, applications using GTK+ 3 should now blend nicely with applications using GTK+ 2 when one of the native Xfce themes is used.

==== Greybird theme ====

Another option is to use the [http://shimmerproject.org/project/greybird/ Greybird] theme, which has support for GTK+ 2, GTK+ 3, xfwm4, emerald, & metacity:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/greybird}}

Go to {{Path|Xfce menu}} -> {{Path|Settings}} -> {{Path|Appearance}}. Or run <tt>xfce4-appearance-settings</tt>.  Select "Greybird" from the "Style" list.

Now GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3 applications should have a consistent look.

=== Other themes ===

Other themes available in Portage that are compatible with XFCE can be emerged with the following list:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/clearlooks-phenix x11-themes/gnome-themes-standard x11-themes/gtk-engines-aurora x11-themes/light-themes x11-themes/murrine-themes x11-themes/nimbus x11-themes/oxygen-molecule x11-themes/redhat-artwork x11-themes/shiki-colors x11-themes/tactile3 x11-themes/zukini}}

== Additional applications ==

There are a number of additional applications which are either part of Xfce or support this desktop environment nicely.
