"''Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.''" — [http://xfce.org/ xfce.org]

== Avoiding GNOME deps ==
Avoiding optional GNOME support and packages will keep your system more lean and congruous.

Ensure you're using the basic desktop profile:
{{RootCmd|eselect profile list}}

You'll want the one that ends with <code>…/desktop</code> (not <code>…/gnome</code> or <code>…/kde</code>):
{{RootCmd|eselect profile set 3}}

<code>app-text/poppler</code> has a <code>qt4</code> USE flag:
{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/portage; echo 'app-text/poppler -qt4' >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

You may also simply want to disable the flag globally:
{{RootCmd|echo 'USE{{=}}"${USE} -qt4"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf}}

<code>gnome-base/gvfs</code> has an <code>http</code> USE flag which draws in many GNOME deps you may find unnecessary:
{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/portage; echo 'gnome-base/gvfs -http' >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

Without explicitly including <code>xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd</code> in your <code>emerge</code> command, <code>virtual/notification-daemon</code> will draw in GNOME's <code>''x11-misc''/notification-daemon</code> instead:
{{Emerge|xfce4-meta xfce4-notifyd}}

== Installation ==
In /etc/portage/make.conf, you can add/customize this line: <code>XFCE_PLUGINS="brightness clock logout trash"</code>

The above options may change, the current list is available [http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/profiles/desc/xfce_plugins.desc?view=markup here].

Install the complete Xfce desktop:
{{Emerge|xfce4-meta xfce4-notifyd}}

Or you can select only needed packages:
{{Emerge|xfce-base/xfwm4|xfce-base/xfce4-panel}}

=== Terminal emulator ===
You may need a terminal emulator for Xfce:
{{Emerge|x11-terms/terminal}}

== Starting ==

=== Using <code>startx</code> ===
To start Xfce correctly with <code>startx</code>:
{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>
exec ck-launch-session startxfce4
</pre>}}

=== Using LightDM ===
The display manager (AKA login manager) <code>x11-misc/lightdm</code> also goes well with Xfce:
{{Emerge|lightdm}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm}}

Make sure <code>xdm</code>'s config refers to LightDM:
{{file|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
# ...
CHECKVT=7

# ...
DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"
</pre>}}

Upon first run you may have to select 'Xfce Session' from a drop down.

== Enabling power off and restart buttons from exit window ==

=== Configuring consolekit daemon startup ===
Check if <tt>consolekit</tt> is started:
{{Cmd|rc-status}}
If not, setup startup on boot:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add consolekit}}

=== Configuring policykit daemon ===
Example of its configuration:
{{File|/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/40-power.pkla||<pre>
[Local restart]
Identity=unix-group:users
Action=org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=no
ResultActive=yes

[Local shutdown]
Identity=unix-group:users
Action=org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=no
ResultActive=yes

[Local restart - multiple]
Identity=unix-group:users
Action=org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart-multiple-users
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=no
ResultActive=yes

[Local shutdown - multiple]
Identity=unix-group:users
Action=org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop-multiple-users
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=no
ResultActive=yes
</pre>}}
In this example permission is granted to users in group <tt>users</tt>.

== Volume keys ==
With xfce4-volumed daemon.
{{Emerge|xfce-extra/xfce4-volumed}}

Lower level method using ALSA:
{{Code||<pre>
Run xfce4-keyboard-settings to bind following keys :
volume up button : amixer set Master 5%+
volume down button : amixer set Master 5%-
mute button : amixer set Master toggle
</pre>}}

== Consistent GTK+ 3 theme ==

=== Native Xfce theme engine ===
Xfce's own theme engine, <code>x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce</code>, was recently updated to version 3.0, which implements native support for GTK+ 3 with no further configuration.

Assuming that you have <code>gtk3</code> in your USE flags, the GTK+ 3 version (<code>-r300</code>) should be pulled in by default if you have <code>xfce-base/xfce4-meta</code> or <code>x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce</code> in your world set and you do a world upgrade with the <code>--deep</code> option. If it does not, simply do a:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce}}

This should pull in a version of <code>x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce</code> with the suffix <code>-r300</code> in a new slot.

After emerging the GTK+ 3 version of <code>x11-themes/gtk-engines-xfce</code>, applications using GTK+ 3 should now blend nicely with applications using GTK+ 2 when you use one of the native Xfce themes.

=== Greybird theme ===
Another option is to use the [http://shimmerproject.org/project/greybird/ Greybird] theme, which has support for GTK+ 2, GTK+ 3, xfwm4, emerald, & metacity.
{{Emerge|x11-themes/greybird}}

Go to Xfce menu -> Settings -> Appearance. Or run xfce4-appearance-settings.  Select "Greybird" from the "Style" list.

Now GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3 applications should have consistent look.

== Additional applications ==
* Application finder: {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-appfinder}}
* Volume control: {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-mixer}}
* Text editor: {{Package|app-editors/leafpad}}
* Removable media and drives manager: {{Package|xfce-extra/thunar-volman}}
* Previewer for files from Thunar: {{Package|xfce-extra/tumbler}}
* CD burning application: {{Package|app-cdr/xfburn}}
* Archive manager: {{Package|app-arch/xarchiver}}
* Plugin for Thunar for work with archives, uses {{Package|app-arch/xarchiver}} or {{Package|app-arch/file-roller}}: {{Package|xfce-extra/thunar-archive-plugin}}
* {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-battery-plugin}} is perfect for laptop users. It displays battery percentage, time remaining, power source (AC or battery), fan status, warnings, and can even be configured to execute commands at certain power levels. This feature can be used to put the laptop into hibernate mode when the battery is almost exhausted.
* {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-verve-plugin}} is a small command line embedded into the panel. It's quicker than opening up another terminal when you want to run a command.
* {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-mount-plugin}} gives you a handy method of mounting devices listed in /etc/fstab just by clicking your mouse.
* {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-sensors-plugin}} lets you monitor your hardware sensors, such as CPU temperature, fan RPM, hard drive temp, motherboard voltage, and more.
* {{Package|x11-themes/xfwm4-themes}} adds several window manager themes.
* {{Package|app-office/orage}} is a simple, handy calendar.
* {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-power-manager}} is an application to monitor and manage power usage. This is especially important for laptops! The power manager allows you to adjust screen brightness, choose maximum performance or battery-saving modes, and setup hibernate, suspend, and shutdown actions when the lid is shut or buttons are pressed. You can set xfce4-power-manager to warn you when your battery reaches certain levels, or even turn off your machine. The application comes with a couple of helpful panel plugins to display battery/charging status, and a brightness control.
