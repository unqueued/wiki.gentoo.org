|BLAS and LAPACK runtime switching|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package) are important mathematical libraries widely used in science, engineering, data science and other areas. Gentoo supports a large number of BLAS and LAPACK implementations, but [https://bugs.gentoo.org/632624 switching between them is not implemented properly].

There are [https://github.com/gentoo/sci/issues/805 several approaches] proposed and even [https://github.com/gentoo/sci/pull/837 draft implementation for build-time switching] is available.
