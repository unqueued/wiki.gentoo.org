''LXDE is a GPL licensed open source desktop environment for Unix and other POSIX compliant platforms, such as Linux. The name LXDE stands for "Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment".'' -- http://lxde.org/lxde

== Installation ==
To install the LXDE, emerge the lxde-meta package using the following command:
{{Emerge|lxde-meta}}

== Configuration ==
To start LXDE using startx, add ''"exec startlxde"'' to {{Path|~/.xinitrc}}.
{{RootCmd|echo 'exec startlxde' >> ~/.xinitrc}}

Alternatively, a window manager, such as LXDM, may be used.
{{Note| If you use a login manager like [[SLiM]], XDM, GDM, or KDM, you do not need to edit your ~/.xinitrc. LXDE will simply show up as a choice in your login manager's screen.}}
==Additional applications==
* Text Editor : {{Package|app-editors/leafpad}}
* LXDE Display Manager : {{Package|lxde-base/lxdm}}

===Taking screenshots with xwd===
There are many ways to take screenshots in LXDE, but all require some work. 
Solution below uses xwd to capture screenshots, imagemagick's convert to save them to png, and 
notify-send to send a notification to desktop.
See {{Package|x11-apps/xwd}}, {{Package|media-gfx/imagemagick}}, {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}}.
It places screenshots in $HOME/screenshots/.

First create key bindings:
{{File|~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml||<pre>
...
</keyboard>
  ...
  <!-- taking screenshots -->
  <keybind key="Print">
    <action name="Execute">
      <command>/usr/local/bin/screenshot.sh</command>
    </action>
  </keybind>
  <keybind key="A-Print">
    <action name="Execute">
      <command>/usr/local/bin/screenshot.sh window</command>
    </action>
  </keybind>
  ...
</keyboard>
...
</pre>}}
Then create and make executable the following simple script:
{{File|/usr/local/bin/screenshot.sh||<pre>
FOLDER="$HOME/screenshots/"

if [ ! -d "${FOLDER}" ]; then
  mkdir ${FOLDER}
fi


DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d@%H.%M.%S)
FNAME="${FOLDER}screenshot-${DATE}.png"
C=0
while [ -f "${FNAME}" ] ; do
    FNAME="${FOLDER}screenshot-${DATE}.${C}.png"
    let C++
done

echo "huj" > ${FNAME}

if [ "$1" != "window" ]; then
  if xwd -root | convert - "${FNAME}"; then
    notify-send "Desktop screenshot saved!" "Desktop screenshot was saved as:\n ${FNAME}"
  else
    notify-send "Desktop screenshot could not be saved!" "There was an error."
  fi
else
  if xwd | convert - "${FNAME}"; then
    notify-send "Window screenshot saved!" "Window screenshot was saved as:\n ${FNAME}"
  else
    notify-send "Window screenshot could not be saved!" "There was an error."
  fi
fi
</pre>}}
