''LXDE is a GPL licensed open source desktop environment for Unix and other POSIX compliant platforms, such as Linux. The name LXDE stands for "Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment".'' -- http://lxde.org/lxde

== Installation ==
To install the LXDE, emerge the lxde-meta package using the following command:
{{Emerge|lxde-meta}}

== Configuration ==
To start LXDE using startx, add ''"exec startlxde"'' to {{Path|~/.xinitrc}}.
{{RootCmd|echo 'exec startlxde' >> ~/.xinitrc}}

Alternatively, a window manager, such as LXDM, may be used.
{{Note| If you use a login manager like [[SLiM]], XDM, GDM, or KDM, you do not need to edit your ~/.xinitrc. LXDE will simply show up as a choice in your login manager's screen.}}
==Additional applications==

* LXDE Display Manager : {{Package|lxde-base/lxdm}}
