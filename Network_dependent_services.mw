{{Warning|Starting/stopping network dependant services is still in development.<ref>{{Bug|522206}}</ref>}}
Services having "need net" in their init.d scripts like fetchmail would then start after dhcpcd is started.
{{File|/etc/init.d/fetchmail||<pre>#!/sbin/runscript

piddir=${pid_dir:-/var/run/fetchmail}
pid_file=${piddir}/${RC_SVCNAME}.pid
rcfile=/etc/${RC_SVCNAME}rc

depend() {
        need net
        use mta
}</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|eselect rc start fetchmail
||output=<pre>Starting init script
dhcpcd          * Starting DHCP Client Daemon ...
fetchmail       * WARNING: fetchmail is scheduled to start when dhcpcd has started            [ ok ]
</pre>}}

They will be stopped when dhcpcd turns inactive and will be restarted when dhcpcd is back.
