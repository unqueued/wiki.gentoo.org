Emacs denominates a class of powerful, extensible, self-documenting text editors.  The original implementation still updated today is [[GNU Emacs]], a derivative is [[XEmacs]], which forked from GNU Emacs in the late 80s.  The latter is not the X version of Emacs but a complete separate program.

Apart from the two big contenders, many lightweight implementations exist, a lot are available in Gentoo.
