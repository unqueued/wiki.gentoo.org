'''Emacs''' denominates a class of powerful, extensible, self-documenting text editors. The original implementation still updated today is [[GNU Emacs]], a derivative is [[XEmacs]], which was forked from GNU Emacs in the early 1990s.  The latter is not the X version of Emacs but a complete separate program.

== Available software ==

Apart from the two big contenders, many lightweight implementations exist, many of which are available in Gentoo:

== Ebuild repository ==

The [[Project:Emacs|Emacs project]] runs an [[ebuild repository]] for GNU Emacs and XEmacs (see [[Project:Emacs/Overlay]]) which contains a number of packages including many VCS builds. To add the repository:

{{RootCmd|layman -a emacs}}

Many more emacs-related packages should now be available for installation.
