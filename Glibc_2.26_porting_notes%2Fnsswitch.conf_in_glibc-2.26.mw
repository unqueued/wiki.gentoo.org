== TL;DR (the fix) ==

Make sure the {{Path|/etc/nsswitch.conf}} file contains <code>files</code> entry:

Good:
<source>
# cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
...
passwd:      files
shadow:      files
group:       files
...
</source>

Also good:

<source>
# cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
...
passwd:      compat files
shadow:      compat files
group:       compat files
...
</source>

Bad:

<source>
# cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
...
passwd:      compat
shadow:      compat
group:       compat

...
</source>

== What is broken ==

If you have '''compat''' database only listed as a service resolver
and install '''glibc-2.26''' most programs will fail to resolve
users and groups: login, ssh and so on will fail.

One of many manifestations of the problem:

<source>
portage: 'portage' user or group missing.
         For the defaults, line 1 goes into passwd, and 2 into group.
         portage:x:250:250:portage:/var/tmp/portage:/bin/false
         portage::250:portage
</source>

== Why the breakage ==

Details can be seen at {{Bug|627338}}

'''glibc-2.26''' deprecates obsolete NSL libraries.
(in this case libnss_'''compat'''.so.2 gone away)

Gentoo happened not to change {{Path|nsswitch.conf}} since 2006.

Normally {{Path|/etc/nsswitch.conf}} is installed and updated by
'''glibc''' ebuild when both conditions are met:

* <code>FEATURES=config-protect-if-modified</code> is set in {{Path|make.conf}}
* {{Path|nsswitch.conf}} has no user modifications (kept as installed by '''glibc''')

To be extra cautious '''glibc''' ebuild fails as TODO.

To update {{Path|nsswitch.conf}} the simplest is to add '''files''' entry
into every line using '''compat'''. Example fix:

{{RootCmd|sed 's/\<compat\>/files compat/g' /etc/nsswitch.conf}}
