= DESCRIPTION =

The ''munin'' SELinux module supports the Munin networked resource management tool.

= DOMAINS =

The following is a list of munin related domains.

; munin_t
: is the main domain for the munin daemon
; ‘*’_munin_plugin_t
: is a set of domains related to the munin plugins

= LOCATIONS =

The following list of locations identify file resources that are used by the munin domains. They are by default allocated towards the default locations for munin, so if you use a different location, you will need to properly address this. You can do so through <code>semanage</code>, like so:

{{RootCmd|semanage fcontext -a -t system_cron_spool_t &quot;/usr/local/share/munin/plugins(/.*)?&quot;}}

The above example marks the ''/usr/local/share/munin/plugins'' location as the location where munin plugin executables are stored.

== FUNCTIONAL ==

; munin_etc_t
: is used for the munin configuration files

== EXECUTABLES ==

; munin_exec_t
: is used for the munin binaries
; munin_initrc_exec_t
: is used for the munin init script
; ‘*’_munin_plugin_exec_t
: is used for the munin plugin executables

== DAEMON FILES ==

; munin_log_t
: is used for the munin logs
; munin_plugin_state_t
: is used for the munin plugin state information
; munin_var_lib_t
: is used for the variable information used by munin
; munin_var_run_t
: is used for the variable runtime state information of munin

= POLICY =

The following interfaces can be used to enhance the default policy with munin-related provileges. More details on these interfaces can be found in the interface HTML documentation, we will not list all available interfaces here.

== Plugin template ==

With the <code>munin_plugin_template</code> interface, additional munin plugin domains can be created. The interface takes a single prefix (like “disk”) and will create the proper types and privileges, including (using “disk” as the example):

* ''disk_munin_plugin_t'' as plugin domain
* ''disk_munin_plugin_exec_t'' as plugin executable type
* ''disk_munin_plugin_tmp_t'' as plugin temporary file type

To enable it:

<pre>munin_plugin_template(disk)</pre>

== Administrative role ==

The <code>munin_admin</code> interface grants a user role and type administrative access to the munin types:

<pre>munin_admin(myuser_t, myuser_r)</pre>

= BUGS =

== Munin ==

The <code>net-analyzer/munin</code> package deploys the munin cronjobs as end user cronjobs inside <code>/var/spool/cron/crontabs</code>. The munin cronjobs are meant to be executed as the munin Linux account, but the jobs themselves are best seen as system cronjobs (as they are not related to a true interactive end user).

The default deployed files do not get the ''system_u'' SELinux ownership assigned. To fix this, execute the following command:

{{RootCmd|chcon -u system_u /var/spool/cron/crontabs/munin}}
