The '''dispatch-conf''' utility is used on Gentoo to manage configuration file updates. It allows the user to review (and accept) changes on the files and integrates with '''rcs''' to allow for version-controlled configuration file management.

== Feature: RCS Integration ==
When '''dispatch-conf''' is configured to integrate with '''rcs''', it will store all changes in {{Path|/etc/config-archive}}.

Administrators can then view the differences using the '''rcs''' utilities like '''rlog''' as well as roll-back changes using '''co'''. The '''rcs''' utilities work with file locking itself, so the moment you want to use it in your administrative tasks, understand that:
* '''dispatch-conf''' only stores the changes made when the package suggests to alter the file. Changes you made afterwards are ''not'' registered yet
* when you check out a file, '''rcs''' will want to write the file to the file system, so make sure you backup your existing file first, or work with standard output (see later)
* if you want to check in a file, you first need to take a lock on said file. Also, make sure you opt not to remove the working file

To view the commit history on {{Path|/etc/conf.d/udev}}:
{{Cmd|rlog /etc/config-archive/etc/conf.d/udev,v|output=<pre>
RCS file: /etc/config-archive/etc/conf.d/udev,v
Working file: udev
head: 1.1

</pre>}}

If you want to roll back to a particular version, a simple way to do so is to check out a previous version:
{{RootCmd|cp udev udev.orig
|co -p -r1.1.1.1 /etc/config-archive/etc/conf.d/udev,v > udev
|output=<pre>
etc/config-archive/etc/conf.d/udev,v  -->  standard output
revision 1.1.1.
</pre>}}

After making your final changes (you can use the backup {{Path|udev.orig}} to merge any changes made later), check in the file again:
{{RootCmd|co -p -l /etc/config-archive/etc/conf.d/udev,v}}

Edit the file, and finally check in the changes:
{{RootCmd|ci -l /etc/config-archive/etc/conf.d/udev,v|output=<pre>
/etc/config-archive/etc/conf.d/udev,v  <--  udev
new revision: 1.2; previous revision: 1.1
enter log message, terminated with single '.' or end of file:
>> Merged changes for persistant rules
>> .
done
</pre>}}
