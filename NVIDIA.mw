The [http://www.nvidia.com/ NVIDIA] GPU is a popular graphical chipset. It can be used with either open source ({{package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau}}) or proprietary (close source) drivers ({{package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}). Because it is more up-to-date and efficient, the proprietary driver is often seen as a must-have for the more computationally intensive 3D applications and games.
