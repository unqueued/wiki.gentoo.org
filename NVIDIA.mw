{{Lowercase title}}
The [http://www.nvidia.com/ nVidia] GPU is a popular graphical chipset. It can be used with either open-source drivers ({{package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau}}), or proprietary drivers ({{package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}). The proprietary blob is often seen as a must-have for the more computationally intensive 3D applications and games.
