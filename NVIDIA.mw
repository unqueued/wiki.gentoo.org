NVIDIA is [[Article description::a popular graphical chipset manufacturer.]] NVIDIA GPUs can use either open source ({{package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau}}) or proprietary (closed source) drivers ({{package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}). Because it is more up-to-date and efficient, the proprietary driver is often seen as a must-have for more computationally intensive 3D applications and games.
