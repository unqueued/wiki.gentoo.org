{{DISPLAYTITLE:NVIDIA}}
The [http://www.nvidia.com/ NVIDIA] GPU is a popular graphical chipset. It can be used with either open-source driver ({{package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau}}), or proprietary driver ({{package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}). The proprietary driver is often seen as a must-have for the more computationally intensive 3D applications and games.
