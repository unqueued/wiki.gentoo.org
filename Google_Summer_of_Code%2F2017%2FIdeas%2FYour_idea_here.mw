<!-- Description goes here: --> 
'''Our best proposals, and a significant proportion of our total acceptances every year, come from student-initiated ideas''' rather than those suggested by Gentoo developers. We highly encourage you to suggest your own idea based on what you think would make Gentoo a better distribution. If you do so, we '''strongly recommend''' you work with a potential mentor to develop your idea '''before''' proposing it formally. You can find a potential mentor by contacting Denis/Rafael or via discussion on the gentoo-soc mailing list or #gentoo-soc IRC channel.|
