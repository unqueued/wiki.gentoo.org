'''Signal Desktop''' is a messaging application geared towards privacy.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|net-im/signal-desktop-bin}}:

{{Emerge|net-im/signal-desktop-bin}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Failed to map segment from shared object ===

It is possible to get the following error when starting {{c|signal-desktop}} if {{Path|/tmp}} has been mounted with the <code>noexec</code> mount option:

 Uncaught error or unhandled promise rejection: Error: /tmp/.org.chromium.Chromium.xxxxxx: failed to map segment from shared object

To solve the issue remount {{Path|/tmp}} without the execution restriction:

{{RootCmd|mount -o remount,exec /tmp}}

In order to make the change persist across reboots, it will also be needed to remove the option from {{Path|/etc/fstab}}.

== Removal ==

Uninstall Signal Desktop by issuing:

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|net-im/signal-desktop-bin}}
