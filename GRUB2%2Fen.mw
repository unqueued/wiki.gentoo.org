'''GRUB2''' is a boot loader with support for modern day computer systems. It is meant to replace the older [[GRUB]] boot loader (now referred to as "GRUB Legacy"). GRUB2 has an entirely separate code base from GRUB Legacy and boasts features such as a new shell-like syntax which permits advanced scripting capabilities. Current GRUB Legacy users are encouraged to migrate their systems to GRUB2.

For a shotgun approach, see [[GRUB2 Quick Start]].

== Installation ==

The {{Package|sys-boot/grub}} package is slotted. Both grub-0.97 ([[GRUB|GRUB Legacy]]) and grub-2.00 may be installed at the same time, however only one version of GRUB may be installed in a MBR at a time.

=== Prerequisites ===

By default, GRUB2 will guess a default platform target at build time. This may be overridden by setting the <var>GRUB_PLATFORMS</var> variable in {{Path|make.conf}}.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Example of setting GRUB_PLATFORMS variable for EMU, EFI, and PC support|lang=bash|1=
GRUB_PLATFORMS="emu efi-32 efi-64 pc"
}}

The following platforms are supported depending on the target CPU:

{{Note|Whenever the values in the <var>GRUB_PLATFORMS</var> variable are adjusted GRUB2 will need to be re-emerged in order to build the changed binary. Be sure to use the <code>--newuse --deep</code> options as shown in the [[#Emerge|emerge section]] below.}}

=== Emerge ===

To install GRUB2 use the normal {{c|emerge}} syntax:

{{Emerge|sys-boot/grub:2|params+=--newuse --deep}}

=== Additional software ===

Optionally, install the {{c|os-prober}} utility (provided through the {{Package|sys-boot/os-prober}} package) to have GRUB2 probe for other operating systems when running the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} command. In most instances, this will enable GRUB2 to automatically detect other operating systems (Windows 7, 8.1, 10, etc.).

{{Emerge|sys-boot/os-prober|params+=--newuse}}

The GRUB2 (and optionally {{Package|sys-boot/os-prober}}) installations do not automatically enable the boot loader. These only install the software on the operating system, but to install the boot loader to the system itself (so that it is used when booting the system), additional steps need to be taken, which are covered in the [[#Configuration|Configuration]] section.

== Configuration ==

There are two important aspects to the configuration of GRUB2:

# Installation of GRUB2 software as the boot loader of the system.
# Configuration of the GRUB2 boot loader.

The installation of GRUB2 software is specific to the type of system, and is covered in [[#Installing the boot loader|Installing the boot loader]]. First we cover the configuration of the boot loader itself.

=== Main configuration file ===

The {{c|grub-mkconfig}} script is used to generate a grub configuration. It uses the scripts under {{Path|/etc/grub.d/*}} together with the {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} configuration file to generate the final {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} - the only configuration file used by GRUB2 itself. 

{| class="table"
|-
! File !! Format !! Edits recommended? !! Description
|-
| {{Path|/usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig}} || POSIX shell script || {{No}} || Installed as part of the {{Package|sys-boot/grub}}:2 package. Run this script to generate {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} after configuring the files described below.
|-
| {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} || GRUB2 shell script || {{No}} || The file generated by {{c|grub2-mkconfig}}. This file is evaluated by GRUB2's built-in script interpreter and doesn't necessarily support all POSIX commands or syntax. See the [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Shell_002dlike-scripting scripting reference] in the GRUB manual for supported features. Be aware that modifications to this file won't persist to the next time grub2-mkconfig is run.
|-
| {{Path|/etc/grub.d/*}} || POSIX shell scripts || {{Partial|Maybe}} || Each script under {{Path|/etc/grub.d/*}} that has its execute bit set is evaluated in sequence, and the stdout is concatenated to form the final {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} (or whatever file is given to the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} <code>-o</code> option). These scripts use the current system shell and therefore can use any supported syntax. Ideally they should be POSIX-compatible scripts, and the output script must be compatible with the GRUB2 interpreter. It may be necessary to disable or add scripts. For instance, to add menu items that couldn't be automatically generated.
|-
| {{Path|/boot/grub/custom.cfg}} || GRUB2 shell script || {{Partial|Maybe}} || The /etc/grub.d/41_custom script will reference this file to be read in at boot time if it exists.  This file provides a place to add additional entries or commands and does not require regeneration of the main grub.cfg file.
|-
| {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} || POSIX shell script || {{Yes}} || In most cases this is the only file that should be modified directly. It is mainly used to assign variables used by the scripts in {{Path|/etc/grub.d}} to generate a working configuration file. See [[GRUB2/Config_Variables|GRUB2 configuration variables]] or the [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Simple-configuration official reference] for supported variables.
|}

GRUB2 does not require the administrator to manually maintain a boot option configuration (as is the case with boot loaders such as [[GRUB|GRUB Legacy]] and [[LILO]]). Instead it can generate its configuration file ({{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}}) using the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} command. This utility will use the scripts in {{Path|/etc/grub.d/}} and the settings in {{Path|/etc/default/grub}}.

{{Warning|The {{c|grub-mkconfig}} utility does not work properly when using software RAID. Manual configuration of the scripts in {{Path|/etc/grub.d/}} is necessary, as otherwise after installation the system will be left in a non-bootable state.
}}

After modifying one or more settings, run the {{c|grub-mkconfig}} utility with the <code>-o</code> option pointing to the output file located at {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} (this is GRUB2's default output location):

{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg|output=<pre>
Generating grub.cfg ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.3.0-gentoo
done
</pre>}}

Each time the {{c|grub-mkconfig}} utility is called a new configuration will be generated. 

{{Warning|If {{c|grub-mkconfig}} does not report any found entries then no entries were found. In this case GRUB2 will offer no boot selections when upon system restart which may be a tricky, time consuming situation to resolve. Make sure the output is satisfactory before restarting the system.}}

=== Setting configuration parameters ===

The following variables in {{Path|/etc/default/grub}} are the most common ones to set to control how GRUB2 will function:

{| class="table"
! Variable
! Explanation
! Default value
|-
| <var>GRUB_DEFAULT</var>
| Defines the default menu entry selected on boot. May be a numeric index, a menu title, or "saved". 
| Defaults to first detected entry.
|-
| <var>GRUB_TIMEOUT</var> 
| Delay (in seconds) before booting default menu entry. Set to <code>0</code> to boot immediately or <code>-1</code> to wait indefinitely. 
| The default is 5 seconds.
|-
| <var>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX</var>
| Parameters to be passed on the kernel command line for all Linux menu entries. For instance, to support hibernation, users will need to add <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="resume=/dev/sdXY"</code> with {{Path|/dev/sdXY}} being the swap partition.
| 
|-
| <var>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</var>
| Parameters to be passed on the kernel command line for non-recovery Linux menu entries.
| 
|-
| <var>GRUB_DEVICE</var> 
| The initial root device (i.e. the kernel's <code>root=</code> parameter). Set this to override the {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} command's root device auto-detection. For example, <code>GRUB_DEVICE=/dev/ram0</code> will force <code>root=/dev/ram0</code> to be used in the kernel command line.
| 
|}

For a more complete list, please refer to the [[GRUB2/Config_Variables|GRUB2 configuration variables]] sub-page.

After modifying the parameters, regenerate the GRUB2 configuration file with {{c|grub2-mkconfig}}.

=== Enabling or disabling configuration scripts ===

The directory {{Path|/etc/grub.d/}} contains the scripts that {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} uses to generate a {{Path|grub.cfg}} file. By default the contents of this directory should be similar to the following:

{{Cmd|ls /etc/grub.d/|output=<pre>
00_header  10_linux  20_linux_xen  30_os-prober  40_custom  41_custom README
</pre>}}

GRUB2 will use all installed scripts that are marked as executable (which by default, they all are). To disable any of the scripts simply remove the executable bit from the script's file permissions using the {{c|chmod}} command. In the following example every script but {{Path|00_header}} and {{Path|10_linux}} are disabled:

{{RootCmd|chmod -x /etc/grub.d/<nowiki>{</nowiki>20_linux_xen,30_os-prober,40_custom,41_custom<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}

After modifying the scripts (or removing the executable bit), regenerate the GRUB2 configuration file using {{c|grub2-mkconfig}}.

=== Manipulating configuration scripts ===

Some features or GRUB2 functionalities are only possible to be exploited by modifying the configuration scripts. For instance, to support dual-booting with FreeBSD, the following manipulation needs to be done.

Change the {{Path|/etc/grub.d/40_custom}} script to:  

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/grub.d/40_custom|title=Adding DualBoot|<pre>
menuentry "FreeBSD" --class freebsd --class bsd --class os {
 insmod ufs2
 insmod bsd
 set root=(hd0,1)
 kfreebsd /boot/kernel/kernel
 kfreebsd_loadenv /boot/device.hints
 set kFreeBSD.vfs.root.mountfrom=ufs:/dev/ada0s1a
 set kFreeBSD.vfs.root.mountfrom.options=rw
 set kFreeBSD.hw.psm.synaptics_support=1
}
</pre>}}

{{Path|/dev/sda1}} or <code>(hd0,1)</code> is the partition in which FreeBSD resides. If the normal UFS install was used for the FreeBSD partition then {{Path|/dev/sda1}} is a container (something like a logical partition). It consists of the swap and root partition. Verify the {{Path|40_custom}} script is executable by running {{c|ls -la /etc/grub.d/40_custom}}. If the executable bit is not set then set it using the {{c|chmod u+x 40_custom}} command.  

Next install GRUB2 using the {{c|grub2-install}} command and update GRUB2's configuration file:

{{RootCmd|grub-install /dev/sda
|grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

== Installing the boot loader ==

Installing GRUB2 as the system's boot loader depends on how the system is meant to boot (through [[BIOS]] or UEFI) and how the disk on which the boot loader should be installed is partitioned (using MBR or GPT partition layout).

This article covers the following situations:

* [[#BIOS with MBR|BIOS with MBR]]
* [[#BIOS with GPT|BIOS with GPT]]
* [[#UEFI with GPT|UEFI with GPT]]

Select the installation instructions appropriate for the system.

=== BIOS with MBR ===

{{Note|When the system is meant to dual-boot with Microsoft Windows, make sure that the system itself does ''not'' have an UEFI firmware. Even when such systems are booted in 'legacy BIOS' mode, Microsoft Windows will refuse to boot.}}

Make sure that the {{Path|/boot}} location is available - if this uses a separate partition, make sure that it is mounted:

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}

Run the {{c|grub2-install}} command to copy the relevant files to {{Path|/boot/grub}}. On the PC platform, this also installs a boot image to the Master Boot Record (MBR) or a partition's boot sector. If all goes well, after running {{c|grub2-install}} an output such as the one below is to be expected:

{{RootCmd|grub-install /dev/sda|output=<pre>
Installation finished. No error reported.
</pre>}}

{{c|grub2-install}} accepts a <code>--target</code> option to set the CPU architecture and system platform. If unspecified, {{c|grub2-install}} will attempt to guess the proper values; on an {{Keyword|amd64}}/{{Keyword|x86}} system it will use <code>i386-pc</code> by default. {{c|grub2-install}} also accepts a <code>--boot-directory</code> option to tell the GRUB2 installer which directory to look for GRUB2's boot files. This defaults to the current {{Path|/boot}} but is useful when trying to move a root partition.

==== Partitioning for BIOS with MBR ====

Be sure to leave enough free space before the first partition. Starting the first partition at sector 2048 leaves at least 1 MiB of disk space for the master boot record. It is recommended (but not mandatory) to create an additional partition for GRUB called the ''BIOS boot partition''. This partition just needs to be defined, but not formatted.

If the [[Handbook:Main_Page|Gentoo installation instructions]] were followed, this BIOS boot partition will already be available.

=== BIOS with GPT ===

{{Note|When the system is meant to dual-boot with Microsoft Windows, make sure that the system itself does ''not'' have an UEFI firmware. Even when such systems are booted in 'legacy BIOS' mode, Microsoft Windows will refuse to boot. Also, older Microsoft Windows systems might not support GPT. It is possible to use a hybrid MBR-GPT approach; see [[Hybrid partition table]].}}

If a {{Path|/boot}} partition is needed, start by mounting the {{Path|/boot}} partition:

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}

If all goes well, after running the {{c|grub-install}} command an output such as the one below is to be expected:

{{RootCmd|grub2-install /dev/sda|output=<pre>
Installation finished. No error reported.
</pre>}}

{{c|grub-install}} accepts a <code>--target</code> option to set the CPU architecture and system platform. If unspecified, {{c|grub-install}} will attempt to guess the correct values; on an {{Keyword|amd64}}/{{Keyword|x86}} system it will use <code>i386-pc</code> by default. {{c|grub-install}} also accepts a <code>--boot-directory</code> option to tell the GRUB2 installer which directory to look in for GRUB2's boot files. This defaults to the current {{Path|/boot}} but is useful when trying to move a root partition.

==== Partitioning for BIOS with GPT ====

When a GPT partition table is present on the system, a small ''BIOS boot partition'' with type <code>EF02</code> (which is different from the ''EFI System Partition (ESP)'' which has type <code>EF00</code>) will need to be available. 1 MiB will be enough to work, but 2-4 MiB is a safer option. This BIOS boot partition will hold the stage 2 of the bootloader. BIOS boot partitions do not need to be formatted with a filesystem; the {{c|grub-install}} command will overwrite any existing filesystem with one of its own.

{{Important|The BIOS boot partition is ''not'' the same partition that is commonly mounted at {{Path|/boot}}. The {{Path|/boot}} and BIOS boot are different partitions and should be handled separately. The BIOS boot partition should ''not'' be regularly mounted on the system (i.e., it should ''not'' be defined in {{Path|/etc/fstab}}). The {{Path|/boot}} partition ''can'' be regularly mounted with no issues and therefore can be present in the {{Path|/etc/fstab}} file.}}

To set a partition as a BIOS partition use the command-line tool {{c|parted}} ({{Package|sys-block/parted}}) by typing (change <code>1</code> to the number of the partition to mark as a BIOS boot partition!):

{{RootCmd|set 1 bios_grub on|prompt=(parted) |color=white}}

With {{Package|sys-apps/gptfdisk}}'s {{c|cgdisk}} utility, this is accomplished by setting the partition type to <code>0xEF02</code> and giving it a label of <code>gptbios</code>.

An EFI System Partition is not required, but it would be sensible to make sure that the BIOS boot partition is large enough to be converted to one, should the system motherboard later be upgraded to an UEFI board.

The following is the output of pressing the {{Key|p}} key using the {{c|gdisk}} utility on a GPT-partitioned disk with both a BIOS boot [0xEF02] partition and an EFI [0xEF00] partition:

{{RootCmd|gdisk /dev/sdc|output=<pre>

</pre>}}

{{Note|The <code>0x</code> hexadecimal prefix does not need to be entered for GPT when using {{c|fdisk}}.}}

Using the same setup, the {{c|parted}} utility gives output with slightly different syntax:

{{RootCmd|parted /dev/sdc|output=<pre>

(parted)
</pre>}}

Creating partitions in {{c|gdisk}} is straightforward for users familiar with the {{c|fdisk}} partitioning utility. After starting {{c|gdisk}}, type {{Key|n}} (for new) in the main menu, provide beginning and end sectors (if needed), and set the partition type to <code>EF00</code> for an EFI system partition.

Users who have followed the [[Handbook:Main_Page|Gentoo installation instructions]] will already have the proper partitioning layout set up.

=== UEFI with GPT ===

Make sure that the {{Path|/boot}} location is available - if this uses a separate partition, make sure that it is mounted:

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}

Run the {{c|grub2-install}} command to copy the relevant files to {{Path|/boot/grub}}. This should install Grub2 in {{Path|/boot/grub}}, copy the core image to {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/gentoo/grubx64.efi}}, and call [[Efibootmgr|efibootmgr]] to add a boot entry.

{{RootCmd|grub2-install --efi-directory{{=}}/boot/efi|output=<pre>
Installation finished. No error reported.
</pre>}}

The above command assumes the vfat [[EFI System Partition]] (ESP) is mounted at {{Path|/boot/efi}}.  If the ESP is mounted directly at {{Path|/boot}}, use <code>--efi-directory=/boot</code>. 

{{c|grub2-install}} also accepts a <code>--target</code> option to set the CPU architecture and system platform. If unspecified, {{c|grub2-install}} will attempt to guess the proper values; on an AMD64 UEFI-booted system it will use <code>x86_64-efi</code> by default. {{c|grub2-install}} also accepts a <code>--boot-directory</code> option to tell the GRUB2 installer which directory to look for GRUB2's boot files. This defaults to {{Path|/boot}} but is useful when trying to move a root partition.

==== Partitioning for UEFI with GPT ====

For UEFI GPT boot using GRUB2, the system ''must'' have a dedicated EFI partition containing a FAT filesystem.

The EFI partition can ''replace'' having a {{Path|/boot}} partition on {{Path|/dev/sda1}} by having a {{Path|/boot/efi}} partition on {{Path|/dev/sda1}}. This is to say a successful UEFI boot scenario using GRUB2 ''can'' operate with two partitions total (three total if a swap partition is needed): a root partition and an EFI partition. Using this configuration, the {{Path|/boot}} ''folder'' will be located in the root {{Path|/}} ''partition'' (at {{Path|/boot}}) and the EFI ''partition'' will mount ''in'' the boot ''folder'' (at {{Path|/boot/efi}}). For further clarification, see the example {{Path|/etc/fstab}} file below.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|title=Example of an UEFI capable {{Path|/etc/fstab}} file with a swap partition:|<pre>
/dev/sda1		/boot/efi	vfat		noauto,noatime	1 2
/dev/sda2		none		swap		sw		0 0
/dev/sda3		/		ext4		noatime		0 1
</pre>}}

Generating a 100MB partition for {{Path|/boot/efi}} should provide plenty of space for holding multiple {{Path|*.efi}} files (multiple entries will most likely not be needed; most systems will only use one).

Create the partition using the partitioning [[Partition#GUID_Partition_Table|tool of choice]]. The {{c|gdisk}} ({{Package|sys-apps/gptfdisk}}) and {{c|parted}} ({{Package|sys-block/parted}}) tools fit nicely for this purpose. When using the {{c|gdisk}} utility, be sure to use type <code>EF00</code>.

Proceed to create a FAT filesystem on the EFI system partition using {{c|mkdosfs}} and add it to {{Path|/etc/fstab}} by following the example below:

{{RootCmd|mkdosfs -F 32 -n efi-boot /dev/sda1
|mkdir /boot/efi}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|title=Adding the /boot/efi mount entry|<pre>
/dev/sda1		/boot/efi	vfat		noauto,noatime	1 2
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|mount /boot/efi}}

{{Note|It is helpful to set the <var>GRUB_PLATFORMS</var> variable in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. This will assist GRUB2 in determining what options to use when detecting the proper EFI target. For 32-bit UEFI systems use <code>efi-32</code>. For 64-bit use <code>efi-64</code>.}}

{{Important|In order for GRUB2 to install properly, the EFI directory ''must'' be mounted ''and'' the <code>efivars</code> kernel module must be loaded before the {{c|grub2-install}} command will complete successfully.}}

==== Alternative: using the default UEFI firmware location ====

If the system's UEFI firmware fails to find GRUB2's EFI bootloader file, using the default boot loader location should provide a working solution. This circumvents the boot menu managed by [[Efibootmgr|efibootmgr]] and thus offers reduced functionality, but is less error prone. To do this, verify the EFI partition is mounted at {{Path|/boot/efi}} then copy the file {{Path|grubx64.efi}} located at {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/gentoo/grubx64.efi}} to {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI}}. This example assumes a 64-bit UEFI system, adjust accordingly for 32-bit UEFI systems.

== Extended features ==

GRUB2 has many features that make it a very powerful boot loader. It supports:

* Booting from UEFI platforms.
* Booting from GPT partitioned drives without needing a hybrid MBR (hybrid MBR can enabled as needed for compatibility or portability).
* Booting from a [[btrfs]] formatted {{Path|/boot}} partition.
* Booting directly from a [[btrfs]] raid set without needing an [[initramfs]] for early mount setup.
* Booting directly from logical volume management (such as [[LVM|LVM2]]).
* Booting with support for DM-RAID (RAID 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10).
* Booting from encrypted devices (LUKS).

Some specific features are explained in more detail next.

=== Chainloading ===

GRUB2 was built with a truly improved chainload mode when compared to GRUB Legacy. To chainload another boot loader, use the <code>chainloader</code> option.

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/grub/grub.cfg|title=Chainloading another bootloader|<pre>
menuentry "Custom Super Bootloader Example" {
     insmod part_msdos
     insmod chain
     chainloader (hd1,1)+1
}
</pre>}}

For more information on chainloading, please see the [[GRUB2/Chainloading|Chainloading]] sub-page.

=== Using framebuffer display ===

To have GRUB2 use a [[framebuffer]] graphical display, re-emerge GRUB with the <code>truetype</code> USE flag enabled. This will install a default True Type font as well as a font conversion utility.

{{Emerge|--newuse sys-boot/grub:2}}

Proceed to configure the default GRUB2 configuration file located at {{Path|/etc/default/grub}}. For example:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default/grub|title=Framebuffer related settings|lang=bash|1=
# Set resolution and color depth

In order to find out what display modes the system's graphics card supports, use the following commands on the GRUB2 shell:

{{Cmd|prompt=(grub)|color=white|insmod all_video|videoinfo}}

== Troubleshooting ==

Most of the issues can be resolved by ensuring that the partition layout is correct. Make sure enough space is available before the first partition of the disk, or optionally make sure that a ''BIOS boot partition'' is available. Also verify that {{Path|/boot/grub/grub.cfg}} was correctly generated with {{c|grub2-mkconfig}}, or generate one with a custom menu entry.

For more GRUB2 troubleshooting, please refer to the [[GRUB2/Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] sub-article.

There are a few specific GRUB2 resources available:

* In [[GRUB2/Chainloading|Chainloading]] the use of GRUB2 to boot other boot loaders is described. This is important to read when dual-booting systems, or when GRUB2 needs to be configured to boot ISO files.
* In [[GRUB2/AdvancedStorage|Advanced storage]] the necessary steps are documented on how to install and use GRUB2 on more advanced storage situations, such as software RAID, logical volumes or encrypted file systems.
* In [[GRUB2/Config_Variables|Configuration variables]] an exhaustive list of GRUB2 configuration variables, as used by {{Path|/etc/default/grub}}, is documented.
* In [[GRUB2/Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] a list of common GRUB2 errors (with their solutions) is presented.
* In [[Hybrid_partition_table|Hybrid partition table]] the use of a mixed MBR/GPT setup is documented, as well as how to use such hybrid partition layout with GRUB2.
