|Port Fedora UEFI Support|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Computer manufacturers are adopting UEFI as a BIOS replacement on amd64 systems, but Gentoo is currently unable to boot on such systems using GRUB 0.97. Intel wrote patches for UEFI support that were adopted by Fedora's GRUB fork. Porting those patches from [http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p{{=}}grub.git;a{{=}}summary Fedora's GRUB fork] to sys-boot/grub would be extremely useful.
