Virtualbox is software that allows the user to run a Guest Operating System inside of the Host Operating System, without having to reboot.

== Installation ==
{{Emerge|app-emulation/virtualbox}}

The useflag 'qt4' is for graphical interface.

=== Running ===
Users will not be able to run and use Virtualbox if they are not a member of the "vboxusers" group.
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <user> vboxusers}}
Changes will not take effect until the user re-logins.

== Usage ==

== Performance Problems ==
=== Microsoft Windows Guest ===
* Do not enable APIC for Microsoft Windows guests!&nbsp; (VirtualBox also has a bad habit of enabling this option at it's own will.)
* If you elect to use SATA controller, it is recommended to use Intel's SATA 7.8 driver version (ie. iata78_enu.exe).&nbsp; Using other versions will cause performance problems along with blue screen errors!
* Slow performance using SATA driver?&nbsp; Only use the SATA controller interface for the hard disk.&nbsp; Remove any CDROMs from the SATA controller and place them onto a IDE Controller.
* When installing the VirtualBox Guest Additions into your Windows operating system, do not select to enable Direct3D (experimental) option as this will cause resizing problems and other anomalies.&nbsp; Also, you need to install the Guest Additions from Safe Mode.

After performing the above, you should see blazingly fast performance of the Windows operating system guest within VirtualBox on Linux.

=== Linux Guest ===
None!
