After proper configuration, every part of the Thinkpad T420 is Linux friendly.

== Installation ==

=== Firmware ===

The Linux firmware package is needed since the Centrino Advanced-N 6205 AGN wifi adapter requires a specific firmware file.

The only file that is needed is the {{Path|iwlwifi-6000g2a-6.ucode}} firmware file. It must be compiled directly into the kernel binary. Obtain the file by installing the Linux firmware package:

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}

=== Kernel ===

For a pre-built, hand-selected, Gentoo specific .config file: 4.9.0
