When dealing with Linux systems in an international context or for a specific country / region, both localization (abbreviated to ''l10n'') and internationalization (abbreviated to ''i18n'') play an important part. It allows administrators and users to select the language of choice on the platform, timezone selection, character ordering and more. In Gentoo Linux, localization is supported in various levels ranging from kernel support up to end user application support.
