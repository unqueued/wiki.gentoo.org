When dealing with Linux systems in an international context or for a specific country or region, both localization (abbreviated to ''[[wikipedia:Language localisation|l10n]]'') and internationalization (abbreviated to ''[[wikipedia:Internationalization and localization|i18n]]'') play an important part. It [[Article description::allows administrators and users to select the language of choice on the platform, timezone selection, character ordering and more.]] In Gentoo Linux, localization is supported in various levels ranging from kernel support up to end user application support.

== Localization in Linux ==

Localization plays a part in many layers of a Linux system.

=== Linux kernel ===

In the Linux kernel, localization is enabled through the ''Native Language Support'' setting as exemplified by the [[UTF-8#Application_support|UTF-8 article]].

=== Core system ===

On the core system level (C libraries and affiliated tools), most localization is handled through the [[Localization/Guide#Locale_system|locale system]] and [[Localization/Guide#Keyboard_layout_for_the_console|console keyboard layout]] which are described well in the [[Localization/Guide|Gentoo Localization Guide]] article.

=== Graphical environments ===

For the graphical environments, Xorg honors the locale settings, but has its own method for selecting the [[Localization/Guide#Keyboard_layout_for_the_X_server|keyboard layout for the X server]]. The desktop environments on top, such as [[KDE#Localization|KDE]] and [[GNOME]], might have additional steps you have to go through in order to enable the localization and internationalization settings correctly.
