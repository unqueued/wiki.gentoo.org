=== Syntax validation for .desktop files ===
The [https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/desktop-file-utils/ official validation tool] for {{Path|.desktop}} files is distributed with the package {{Package|dev-util/desktop-file-utils}}
{{Cmd|desktop-file-validate yourfile.desktop}}

=== Executable bit in .desktop files ===

{{Path|.desktop}} files in {{Path|/usr/share/applications/}} should have consistent executable bits.

As of 2017-06-16 many ebuilds (mostly KDE) create executable {{Path|.desktop files}} ({{Bug|621966}}).

Look for executable {{Path|.desktop}} files on the system with:

{{Cmd|find /usr/share/applications/ -executable -type f}}

Please report any violations upstream.

==== Executable bit on Ubuntu systems ====
[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Policies#Execute-Permission_Bit_Required The Ubuntu Security Policy]
makes use of executable bits:

{{CodeBox|1=
Applications, including desktops and shells, must not run executable code from files when they are both:

    lacking the executable bit
    located in a user's home directory or temporary directory. 

The GNOME or KDE MIME type handlers must not circumvent this principle.

This includes *.desktop, *.jar, and *.exe files.

    Look for .desktop files with MimeType= and Exec= lines that do not use "cautious-launcher"}}

This does not apply to software which is installed via Gentoo ebuilds. Software should not ship a .desktop file with executable bit. The user can set the bit on demand where it is needed.

=== Ideas / Todo ===

* we could check for the x bit in https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/portage.git/tree/pym/portage/util/_desktop_entry.py
* In the past there were discussions about '''requiring''' them to be executable: https://commit-digest.org/issues/2009-02-08/
* 2017-06-18 {{User|Jstein}} asked on the [https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2017-June/thread.html#13920 freedesktop mailing list] about the {{Path|.desktop}} file.
* KDE: "Note: Since KDE 4.3, there are more restrictions on authorized desktop files to prevent users from inadvertently running trojan desktop files. Your application launchers should have the executable bit set to prevent issues." source: [https://api.kde.org/4.x-api/kdelibs-apidocs/kdecore/html/classKDesktopFile.html#ab9222da1ca239fc3847d31833bc45552 kde.org]
* Xfce: please see {{Bug|465740}} about thunar behavior
