{{Path|.desktop}} files in {{Path|/usr/share/applications/}} should have consistent executable bits.

As of 2017-06-16 many ebuilds (mostly KDE) create executable {{Path|.desktop files}} ({{Bug|621966}}).

This page intends to collect information about common problems and how to fix these.

=== Find problematic packages/files ===

Look for executable {{Path|.desktop}} files on the system with:

{{Cmd|find /usr/share/applications/ -executable -type f}}

Please report any violations upstream.

=== Ideas / Todo ===

* we could check for the x bit in https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/portage.git/tree/pym/portage/util/_desktop_entry.py
* In the past there were discussions about '''requiring''' them to be executable: https://commit-digest.org/issues/2009-02-08/
* 2017-06-18 {{User|Jstein}} asked on the [https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2017-June/thread.html#13920 freedesktop mailing list] about the {{Path|.desktop}} file.
