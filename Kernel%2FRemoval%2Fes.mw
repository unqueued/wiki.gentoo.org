Este artículo describe la eliminación de [[kernel/es|núcleos]] antiguos

== Eliminar los fuentes del núcleo ==

After a new kernel is installed and if it works satisfactorily, the old kernel can be removed. To remove the old kernel sources, emerge's ''--depclean'' option (short form ''-c'') can be used to remove all old or unused versions of a slotted package, e.g. for {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}.

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|gentoo-sources}}

Be sure to verify that it is not removing the sources for the currently running kernel. (See [[Kernel/Upgrade|kernel upgrade]] article on how to upgrade.)

=== Protecting kernel sources ===

If newer kernel sources has been merged and you run ''--depclean'' before switching to the newer sources, the current sources will be removed. But if you want to stay with the current sources, this removal is not wanted, because you may need the sources e.g. for updating external kernel modules. It's therefore good practice to add the specific kernel version to your world file to protect it from ''--depclean'' operations.

{{Emerge|params+=--noreplace|gentoo-sources:3.3.8}}

Note the slot notation, using a colon instead of a dash. Every kernel version is its own slot.

== Remove kernel leftovers ==

=== Using eclean-kernel ===

{{Package|app-admin/eclean-kernel}} is a simple tool for old kernel cleanup/removal. It removes both built kernel files and build directories if they're no longer reference by any preserved kernel.

For example, to keep three newest kernels around:

{{RootCmd|eclean-kernel -n 3}}

=== Manual removal ===

Portage however only removes the files it installed - the files generated during the kernel build and installation remain. They can be safely removed.

* When a kernel is built in the source directory, files generated during the build process remain, and are not removed by Portage:

: {{RootCmd|rm -r /usr/src/linux-3.X.Y}}

* During kernel setup, the kernel modules are copied to a sub directory of <tt>/lib/modules/</tt>:

: {{RootCmd|rm -r /lib/modules/3.X.Y}}

* The old files in {{Path|/boot}} can also be removed:

: {{RootCmd|rm /boot/kernel-3.X.Y|rm /boot/System.map-3.X.Y|rm /boot/config-3.X.Y}}

* Lastly, remove all leftover entries from your bootloader's config file.
