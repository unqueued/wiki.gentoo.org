This article describes how to set up SSDs (Solid State Drives) on Gentoo Linux. It presumes the user has obtained knowledge of setting up, partitioning, and formatting [[HDD|mechanical hard drives]].

== Considerations ==

=== Rootfs ===

The <code>-odiscard</code> option on a rootfs mount should not be used. {{c|discard}} is the "TRIM" command that tells the SSD to do its magic. Having discard running constantly could potentially cause performance degradation on older SSDs. Modern SSDs use discard by default. Rather the following command can be used manually or be setup as a cron job (see below) to run twice a day, which should suffice for the rootfs:

{{RootCmd|fstrim -v /}}

=== Mount point ===

If you're going to have a low write directory mounted on SSD, using the <code>discard</code> mount option will be fine in {{Path|[[fstab|/etc/fstab]]}}. See below. If you're going to mount a database to an SSD, you probably want timed TRIM commands rather than the discard option.

== After hardware installation ==

=== Partitioning ===

The {{c|[[Handbook:AMD64/Blocks/Disks#Alternative:_Using_fdisk_to_partition_the_disk|fdisk]]}} utility ({{Package|sys-apps/util-linux}}, version 2.24.1-r2 and up) can be used for GPT disk partitioning.

Use type {{c|[[Handbook:AMD64/Blocks/Disks#Viewing_the_current_partition_layout|fdisk /dev/sda]]}} to run {{c|fdisk}}, use {{Key|M}} option for help. The following is an example for GPT partition table with BIOS motherboard. Type {{Key|G}}+{{Key|Enter}} to create a new empty GPT partition table on the SSD. Type {{Key|N}}+{{Key|Enter}}, {{Key|Enter}}, {{Key|Enter}}, {{Key|+2M}}+{{Key|Enter}}, {{Key|T}}+{{Key|Enter}}, {{Key|4}}+{{Key|Enter}} to create BIOS boot partition.

{{RootCmd|fdisk /dev/sda|output=<pre>
   Command (m for help): n
   Partition number (1-128, default 1): 
   First sector (2048-117231374, default 2048): 
   Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-117231374, default 117231374): +2M
   
   Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux filesystem' and of size 2 MiB.
   
   Command (m for help): t
   Selected partition 1
   Partition type (type L to list all types): 4
   Changed type of partition 'Linux filesystem' to 'BIOS boot partition'.
</pre>}}
   
Next create a 2GB swap partition:

{{GenericCmd|<pre>
   Command (m for help): n
   Partition number (2-128, default 2): 
   First sector (6144-117231374, default 6144): 
   Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (6144-117231374, default 117231374): +2G
   
   Created a new partition 2 of type 'Linux filesystem' and of size 2 GiB.
   
   Command (m for help): t
   Partition number (1,2, default 2):
   Partition type (type L to list all types): 15
   
   Changed type of partition 'Linux filesystem' to 'Linux swap'.
</pre>}}

Finally create system root partition and write the changes:

{{GenericCmd|<pre>
   Command (m for help): n
   Partition number (3-128, default 3): 
   First sector (4200448-117231374, default 4200448): 
   Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (4200448-117231374, default 117231374): 
   
   Created a new partition 3 of type 'Linux filesystem' and of size 53.9 GiB.
   
   Command (m for help): p
   Disk /dev/sda: 55.9 GiB, 60022480896 bytes, 117231408 sectors
   Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
   Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
   I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
   Disklabel type: gpt
   Disk identifier: E19B261A-21EA-4529-B736-1A4E48FC77A1
   
   Device           Start          End   Size Type
   /dev/sda1         2048         6143     2M BIOS boot partition
   /dev/sda2         6144      4200447     2G Linux swap
   /dev/sda3      4200448    117231374  53.9G Linux filesystem
   
   Command (m for help): w
   
   The partition table has been altered.
   Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
   Syncing disks.
</pre>}}

Although {{c|fdisk}} is a tool familiar to many Linux users, other common partitioning tools exist: {{c|gdisk}}, {{c|gparted}}, and {{c|[[Handbook:AMD64/Blocks/Disks#Default:_Using_parted_to_partition_the_disk|parted]]}}. All of them (newer versions) handle partition alignment automatically. When in doubt whether partition is aligned, check that each partition starts on a MiB boundary (multiple of 2048 sectors). This should be 'safe' for any device (SSD or not).

==== LVM ====

LVM aligns to MiB boundaries and allows discards by default. No special configuration is required.

In order to TRIM all unused space in the VG use the {{c|blkdiscard}} utility:

{{RootCmd
|lvcreate -l100%FREE -n trim yourvg
|blkdiscard /dev/yourvg/trim
|lvremove yourvg/trim
}}

Alternatively, there is a discard option in {{Path|lvm.conf}} which makes LVM discard entire LV on lvremove, lvreduce, pvmove and other actions that free physical extents (PE) in a VG. However, enabling it will immediately render the system unable to undo any changes to the LV layout.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/lvm/lvm.conf|1=
devices {
  [...]
  issue_discards = 1
} 
}}

==== LUKS ====

For TRIM to work on encrypted [[DM-Crypt_LUKS|LUKS]] devices, they have to be opened with the <code>--allow-discards</code> option.

{{RootCmd|cryptsetup luksOpen --allow-discards /dev/thing luks}}

When root-device exists on [[DM-Crypt_LUKS|LUKS]], enabling TRIM depends on the [[Initramfs]] implementation.
When using [[genkernel]] for creating your initramfs, pass the following kernel option:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default/grub|1=
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="[...] root_trim=yes"
}}

When using [[dracut]] for creating your initramfs, pass the following kernel option:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default/grub|1=
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="[...] rd.luks.allow-discards"
}}

=== Formatting ===

If you can find your erase block size, you can add some extended attributes that may help performance.
For software raid, you really should know the erase block size. Consider this information when making your purchase.
Regardless of whether you're using RAID or not, setting extended values is known to be beneficial. https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID_setup#ext2.2C_ext3.2C_and_ext4

http://blog.nuclex-games.com/2009/12/aligning-an-ssd-on-linux/

The modern FAQ found on the Arch wiki too:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSD

==== Without knowing the erase block size ====

#Formatting the rootfs partition /dev/sda3:
#Using 4096 byte blocks by default aligns the SSD for writes (see [defaults] section of /etc/mke2fs.conf and also 
#man mkfs.ext4 about "-b block-size" and "-T usage-type[,...]" inside it):

{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3}}

==== With knowing the erase block size | this info can be outdated ====

#Formatting the rootfs partition /dev/sda3:
#Using 4096 byte blocks aligns the SSD for writes;
#Using ERASE_BLOCK_SIZE / 4 as the stride and stripe width size;
#In this example, OCZ Vertex drives have 512 kibbibyte -
#Erase Block size, therefore stride/stripe-width = 512/4 = 128:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 -E stride{{=}}128,stripe-width{{=}}128 /dev/sda3}}

===== known erase block sizes =====

# crucial m500 240G; 
# Page Size = 16KB, 
# 512 Pages per Block <ref>http://www.anandtech.com/show/6884/crucial-micron-m500-review-960gb-480gb-240gb-120gb</ref>
# 16KB * 512 pages = 8192KB block size
# 8192KB / 4 = 2048KB for stride and stripe width size

==== blkdiscard ====

If you are formatting a previously used device and your preferred {{c|mkfs}} does not support bulk discards when creating the filesystem, you can use {{c|blkdiscard}} (from {{Package|1=sys-apps/util-linux-2.23}} or later) before creating the filesystem.

=== Mounting ===

Given the considerations above, either add something similar to this:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
/dev/sda3          /          ext4          defaults,relatime,discard          0 1
}}

Or:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
/dev/sda3          /          ext4          defaults,relatime                  0 1
}}

If you choose the latter, see the [[SSD#Cron|cron]] section below you don't want to manually TRIM the drive.

Once you've set up {{Path|/etc/fstab}} you can run the following command to have the drive mounted:

{{RootCmd|mount -a}}

In the same way you can add discard option to the swap line in fstab too. The following example shows you how SSD disk swap can be parallelized with SATA disk swap:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
/dev/sda2          none           swap         sw,pri=3,discard          0 0
/dev/sdb2          none           swap         sw,pri=3                  0 0
}}

Once you've set up swap in fstab you can run the following command to make swap available:

{{RootCmd|swapon -a}}

== Notes ==

=== cron ===

Run <code>fstrim -v /</code> from cron twice a day to automatically do "discard":

   #Mins  Hours  Days   Months  Day of the week   command
   15     1,13   *      *       *                 /sbin/fstrim -v /

There is also a semi-automatic cronjob available on GitHub called [http://chmatse.github.io/SSDcronTRIM/ SSDcronTRIM] which has the following features:

* Distribution Independent script (developed on my Gentoo system).
* The script decides every time depending on the disk usage how often (monthly, weekly, daily, hourly) each partition has to be trimmed.
* Recognizes if it should install itself into /etc/cron.{monthly,weekly,daily,hourly}, {{Path|/etc/cron.d}} or any other defined directory and if it should make an entry into crontab.
* Checks if the kernel meets the requirements, the filesystem is able to and if the SSD supports trimming.
* Simply install it by running it once without any option and uninstall it with the <code>-d</code> option

Future version should implement:

* Use of {{c|nice}} and {{c|ionice}} to let trimm only run when the disc is not busy.
* Overgive options to fstrim (e.g. '-m 1M')
* support for encrypted filesystem (LUKS)

=== fstrimDaemon ===

If your computer turned off when cron scheduled its job, fstrim would not be called at all. You can install [https://github.com/dobek/fstrimDaemon fstrimDaemon] to solve this problem.

=== Temporal files to TMPFS ===

When using an SSD, administrators generally want to reduce the amount of writes performed. You can mount your desired mountpoints into a TMPFS for reduce the I/O to the disk (and improve performance)

this is an example of {{Path|/tmp}} and {{Path|/var/tmp}} on TMPFS but you must study all your actions and your convenience
{{FileBox|filename=[[fstab|/etc/fstab]]|1=# temporal mountpoints on TMPFS
tmpfs           /tmp            tmpfs           size=16G,noatime        0 0
tmpfs           /var/tmp        tmpfs           size=1G,noatime         0 0}}

Remember that all data in TMPFS will be loss after reboot or shutdown

==== Portage TMPDIR on TMPFS ====

On Gentoo, Portage is a huge source of writes, and putting these writes into system memory rather than a disk is beneficial. If you have more than 8GB of ram you may want to consider using [[Portage_TMPDIR_on_tmpfs|tmpfs]], which is a way to dedicate some system memory to storage on a temporary basis. It is generally advised to not use more than half of the available system memory for [[Portage_TMPDIR_on_tmpfs|tmpfs]].

For the next example, presume the system has 12GB of memory and the user would like to allow up to 6GBs for [[Portage_TMPDIR_on_tmpfs|tmpfs]]. Edit {{Path|/etc/fstab}} and add:

{{FileBox|filename=[[fstab|/etc/fstab]]|1=
tmpfs			/tmp		tmpfs		size=6G,noatime 	0 0
}}

After the fstab entry is set, tell Portage to use the above location to compile temporary space. This is done in {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]}}:

{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]|lang=bash|1=
# This may fail on large compiles unless you have greater than 20GB of system memory is available. Scratch space for Libreoffice can exceed 8GB; compile will fail if it runs out of space.
# RAM used by [[Portage_TMPDIR_on_tmpfs|tmpfs]] is freed back to the pool when it is no longer in use, so when using Portage or other software that uses /tmp there should be a huge performance gain.
PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/tmp"
}}

you can explain your information on an specific gentoo's wiki article: [[Portage_TMPDIR_on_tmpfs]]

=== XDG cache ===

When running Gentoo on desktop, many programs, using X windows systems (Chromium, Firefox, Skype, etc.) are making frequent disk I/O every few seconds to cache. Default cache directory is {{Path|~/.cache}}, which is on hard drive and should be moved to [[tmpfs]].

Create the file {{Path| /etc/profile.d/xdg_cache_home.sh }} and add the following lines to it:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/profile.d/xdg_cache_home.sh|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/bash

export XDG_CACHE_HOME="/tmp/${USER}/.cache"
}}

Do not forget to run <tt>env-update && source /etc/profile</tt>:

{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

{{Note|The above command only updates the variables in the current terminal, new consoles, and their children. Thus, if the user is working in X11, he needs to either type {{Cmd|source /etc/profile}} in every new terminal opened or restart X so that all new terminals source the new variables. If a login manager is used, it is necessary to become root and restart the /etc/init.d/xdm service. }}

{{Warning|
With above change, auto unlocking the gnome keyring didn't work anymore.
/var/log/messages said the following:

   May  5 10:02:52 localhost gnome-keyring-daemon[5561]: couldn't bind to control socket: /home/david/.cache/keyring-hRt5QC/control: No such file or directory
}}

=== Browser profile/s and cache to RAM or HDD ===

Since the profile/s, browser cache*, etc. are relocated into TMPFS (RAM disk) or another mount point into an HDD, the corresponding I/O associated with using the browser is also redirected from the physical drive to RAM, thus reducing wear to the physical drive and also greatly improving browser speed and responsiveness.

You can move them with the utility {{Package|www-misc/profile-sync-daemon}}

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask www-misc/profile-sync-daemon}}

Add that users whose browser/s profile/s will get symlinked to a TMPFS or another mountpoint in the value USERS= and define the new mountpoint for the browser's profile/s and cache in the value VOLATILE=

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/psd.conf|1= USERS="user user2 root"
VOLATILE="/tmp/profile-sync-daemon"}}

close all the browsers, start the daemon and add to your default level on RC

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/psd start|rc-update add psd default}}

you can view all symlinks  viewing the status of the daemon since started

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/psd status}}
