Similar to the [[:/etc/portage/package.mask|{{Path|package.mask}}]] file, {{Path|/etc/portage/package.unmask}} can contain a list packages that are to be unmasked. It is useful for overriding values set in the global {{Path|package.mask}} file. 

{{Note|This file does not override packages that are masked via <var>KEYWORDS</var>.}}
