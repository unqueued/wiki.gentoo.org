Ren'Py is an open-source visual novel engine written mostly in python 2, free for commercial use and even supports Android. It allows to write interactive novels using words, images and sounds to tell the story, but also more complex RPGs or simulation games since the python scripting interface is easy to use. It already features [http://games.renpy.org over 500 works] including a lot of manga and "boy pursues girl" stories (such as [http://games.renpy.org/game/otchi_kocchi_a1.shtml OTChi Kocchi]), but also more serious or even autobiographical stories (such as [http://games.renpy.org/game/homeward.shtml Homeward] or {{Package|games-misc/katawa-shoujo}}) and some extensive RPGs (such as [http://games.renpy.org/game/loren-amazon-princess.shtml Loren the amazon princess] or [http://games.renpy.org/game/planetstronghold.shtml Planet Stronghold]). It also comes with it's own IDE (development useflag) and is slotted, because new versions are sometimes incompatible with older games. You can control the default slot via "eselect renpy".
