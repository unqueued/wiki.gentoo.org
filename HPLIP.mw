'''HPLIP''' ('''HP''' '''L'''inux '''I'''maging and '''P'''rinting) provides printer drivers for HP devices. It also includes scanner, fax support as well as service tools for various multi-purpose peripherals.

== Do you require HPLIP? ==

Using HPLIP is recommended for most HP inkjet or laserjet based printers. There may however be devices which work with a default CUPS install, which provides adequate drivers or PPD files.

For some devices the driver is needed because a binary plugin which is installed with the driver is required to be able to use all features of the device (i. e. printing or scanning is not possible without the plugin), to achieve a better printing quality or to speed up printing. See the binary plugins section for more information.

== Installation ==

For printing support, it is recommended to use the new hpcups driver, which you can enable with the ''hpcups'' USE flag. The old hpijs driver is still included when you build HPLIP with the ''hpijs'' USE flag.

The default install enables dynamically generated ppd files at runtime. Some printers may still require static ppd files. If you encounter problems when using '''hp-setup''' try enabling the ''static-ppds'' USE flag and rebuild HPLIP.

For USB printers {{Package|net-print/cups}} has to be built with the ''usb'' USE flag. This way it makes use of the {{Package|dev-libs/libusb}} user space tool which replaces kernel usb printer support (CONFIG_USB_PRINTER). In case of problems you can disable the ''usb'' USE flag for {{Package|net-print/cups}} and activate the kernel functionality again. All users who need to access the printer have to be a member of the lp group.

To be able to set up a network printer {{Package|net-print/cups-1.5}} has to be built with USE ''avahi'' or ''slp''. The 1.6 series of {{Package|net-print/cups}} has dropped slp support and one can choose to build it with USE ''avahi'' or ''zeroconf''. To be able to print on a network printer HPLIP needs to be built with USE ''snmp''. 

For some scanner devices the appropriate sane backend needs to be activated. To find out which backend is required for your device go to http://www.sane-project.org/cgi-bin/driver.pl and search for 'HEWLETT-PACKARD' as manufacturer. This provides a list of all supported devices including the required backend. For instance if the device needs the hp backend the following must be added to the portage configuration to build it when installing {{Package|media-gfx/sane-backends}}:

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
SANE_BACKENDS="hp"
</pre>}}

{{Note|The hpaio backend is provided by HPLIP itself if the ''scanner'' USE flag is activated. If this backend is needed no additional configuration needs to be done as the following settings should already be defined in {{Path|/etc/sane.d/dll.conf}}.}}

{{File|/etc/sane.d/dll.conf||<pre>
# Add support for the HP-specific backend.  Needs net-print/hplip installed.
hpaio
</pre>}}

=== Kernel ===
USB connected devices require basic kernel USB support.

Network connected devices require basic kernel network support.

The above two methods are usually already enabled within most kernels.

Parallel connected devices require the following kernel options:
{{Kernel|Optional: Parallel port printer support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Parallel port support  --->
        <*>   PC-style hardware
        [*]   IEEE 1284 transfer modes
    Character devices  --->
        <*> Parallel printer support
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
Install {{Package|net-print/hplip}}:
{{USEflag|package=net-print/hplip
|X+yes
|doc
|fax
|hpcups+yes+yes
|hpijs++no
|kde+yes
|libnotify+yes
|minimal++no
|policykit+yes
|parport
|qt4+yes
|scanner
|snmp
|static-ppds
}}

{{Emerge|hplip}}

== Configuration ==

=== Printers and Faxes ===
{{Note|Make sure your USB printer is plugged into your computer or your network
printer into the network socket.}}

If installed with enabled ''qt4'' USE flag, use the "HP Device Manager" to configure your devices.

Alternatively you can run '''hp-setup''' in a terminal:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup}}

For network printer also specify the printer's IP address:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27}}

Afterwards you should restart the cups daemon:
{{RootCmd|rc-service cupsd restart}}

=== Scanners ===
Overall, scanners should just work and will be detected with XSane etc.

== Testing ==

=== Printer ===
After completing hp-setup you should be provided with the option of printing a test page. You can do this later using the "HP Device Manager" or the CUPS web interface which is located at http://localhost:631/.

=== Scanner ===
Use '''xsane''' and then press the preview button to ensure the scanner driver is installed and working properly.

== Upgrading ==

Every time when upgrading HPLIP run '''hp-setup -r''' to remove all printers and configure them again as described above in the configuration section.

== Binary plugins ==

There are some devices which require a binary plugin to use all functions the device provides. A list with devices requiring the binary plugin including the reasons why it is needed is available at http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/plugin.html. Gentoo currently does not support the binary plugin. '''hp-setup''' however tries to automatically install the plugin. The installed files are out of portages control and are located under {{Path|/usr/share/hplip/data/firmware/}} {{Path|/usr/share/hplip/data/plugins/}} and {{Path|/usr/share/hplip/prnt/plugins/}}.
For installing just the plugin without configuring printer queues '''hp-plugin''' is available.
If installing the plugin fails with '''hp-setup''' or '''hp-plugin''' the plugin is available for download at http://www.openprinting.org/download/printdriver/auxfiles/HP/plugins/. To install the plugin the downloaded *.run file has to executed in a shell:

{{RootCmd|sh hplip-version-plugin.run}}

Afterwards follow the instructions of the installer similar to '''hp-setup''' or '''hp-plugin'''

== Troubleshooting ==

=== /usr/libexec/cups/backend/hp failed ===
{{RootCmd|rc-service cupsd stop
|cp /etc/cups/printers.conf /etc/cups/printers.conf.20121104}}

Edit this {{Path|/etc/cups/printers.conf}} and remove the lines prefixed with "State", "Reason" and "Type".

Upon saving the file and restarting the cupsd daemon, printing should resume.

=== Error on install "File "./plugin_install.py", line 78 except ImportError, e:" ===
PROBLEM: A snipping of the error follows.

{{RootCmd|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27|output=<pre>

</pre>}}

RESOLUTION: Python 3 is set as main python interpreter. HPLP currently does not work correct with python 3. Switching back to python 2 by using '''eselect python''' fixes this. 

{{Note|Python 2 is still the recommended python interpreter for Gentoo. When using python 3 you should be aware of potential issues.}}

This bug is further documented at the following link {{Bug|718069|site=launchpad}}

=== HPLIP ebuild Upgrades Do Not Upgrade Binary Plugin(s) ===
PROBLEM: The HPLIP ebuild itself does not upgrade the binary plugin(s) when the ebuild is upgraded.  A symptom of this problem, you may get segfaults when starting XSane. (ie. The HP LaserJet M1522nf requires a binary plugin for using the scanning feature.)

RESOLUTION: Following the upgrade instructions should take care of this as '''hp-setup''' trys to upgrade the plugin.
