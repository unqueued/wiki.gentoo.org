'''HPLIP''' ('''HP''' '''L'''inux '''I'''maging and '''P'''rinting) contains print, scan and fax drivers for HP devices.

== Do you require HPLIP? ==
Most HP printers do not require HPLIP to successfully print from. You can likely use a default CUPS install, which likely provides adequate drivers or PPD files.

If you have a MFD with a scanner feature, then you will require HPLIP as it is likely the scanner driver is provided only as a binary blob.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel|Optional: Parallel port printer support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Parallel port support  --->
        <*>   PC-style hardware
        [*]   IEEE 1284 transfer modes
    Character devices  --->
        <*> Parallel printer support
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
Install {{Package|net-print/hplip}}:
{{USEflag|package=net-print/hplip
|X+yes
|doc
|fax
|hpcups+yes+yes
|hpijs++no
|kde+yes
|libnotify+yes
|minimal++no
|policykit+yes
|parport
|qt4+yes
|scanner
|snmp
|static-ppds
}}

{{Note|Also add ''SANE_BACKENDS{{=}}"sane_backends_hp" to your {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.}}

== Configuration ==
If installed with enabled ''qt4'' USE flag, use the "HP Device Manager" to configure your devices.

If not or if the program don't work for you, run '''hp-setup''' in a terminal:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup}}

For network printer also specify the printer's IP address:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27}}

== Testing ==

=== Printer ===
The above command, should provide an option to test print. If it fails printing due to lack of X as root, use your CUPS web interface located at http://localhost:631/ for printing a test page.

=== Scanner ===
Use '''xsane''' and then press the preview button to ensure the binary scanner driver is installed and working properly.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Buggy hp-setup ===
Install HPLIP with ''snmp'' USE flag and try again.
