'''HPLIP''' ('''HP''' '''L'''inux '''I'''maging and '''P'''rinting) provides printer drivers for HP devices. It also includes scanner, fax support as well as service tools for various multi-purpose peripherals.

== Do you require HPLIP? ==

Using HPLIP is recommended for most HP inkjet or laserjet based printers. There may however be devices which work with a default CUPS install, which provides adequate drivers or PPD files.

For some devices the driver is needed because a binary plugin which is installed with the driver is required to be able to use all features of the device (i. e. printing or scanning is not possible without the plugin), to achieve a better printing quality or to speed up printing. See the [[#Binary plugins|binary plugins]] section for more information.

== Installation ==
{{Note|All users who need to manage printers i.e. using the web interface or hp-setup have to be a member of the lpadmin group. Editing the cups configuration files with a text editor however requires root privileges. For users who just need to print no special privileges or group membership is required.}}

For printing support, it is recommended to use the new hpcups driver, which you can enable with the ''hpcups'' USE flag. The old hpijs driver is still included when you build HPLIP with the ''hpijs'' USE flag.

The default install enables dynamically generated ppd files at runtime. Some printers may still require static ppd files. If you encounter problems when using '''hp-setup''' try enabling the ''static-ppds'' USE flag and rebuild HPLIP.

For USB printers {{Package|net-print/cups}} has to be built with the ''usb'' USE flag. This way it makes use of the {{Package|dev-libs/libusb}} user space tool which replaces kernel usb printer support (CONFIG_USB_PRINTER). In case of problems you can disable the ''usb'' USE flag for {{Package|net-print/cups}} and activate the kernel functionality again.

To be able to set up a network printer {{Package|net-print/cups-1.5}} has to be built with USE ''avahi'' or ''slp''. The 1.6 series of {{Package|net-print/cups}} has dropped slp support and one can choose to build it with USE ''avahi'' or ''zeroconf''. To be able to print on a network printer HPLIP needs to be built with USE ''snmp''. 

For some scanner devices the appropriate sane backend needs to be activated. To find out which backend is required for your device go to the sane projects [http://www.sane-project.org/cgi-bin/driver.pl driver search engine] and search for 'HEWLETT-PACKARD' as manufacturer. This provides a list of all supported devices including the required backend. For instance if the device needs the hp backend the following must be added to the portage configuration to build it when installing {{Package|media-gfx/sane-backends}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
SANE_BACKENDS="hp"
}}

{{Note|The hpaio backend is provided by HPLIP itself if the ''scanner'' USE flag is activated. If this backend is needed no additional configuration needs to be done as the following settings should already be defined in {{Path|/etc/sane.d/dll.conf}}.}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sane.d/dll.conf|lang=bash|1=
# Add support for the HP-specific backend.  Needs net-print/hplip installed.
hpaio
}}

=== Kernel ===
USB port connected devices require basic kernel USB support. When using the old kernel USB printer driver which means '''not''' using the ''usb'' USE flag on {{Package|net-print/cups}} the following kernel options must be set:
{{KernelBox|title=Optional: USB printer support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support  --->
        <*> USB Printer support
</pre>}}
If preferred this driver can be enabled as module which will be called '''''usblp'''''. This also makes testing the ''usb'' USE flag easier as one can simple switch between both methods by either disabling the USE flag and load the kernel module or enable the USE flag and unload the kernel module via '''modprobe'''. This saves kernel recompilations and machine restarts and only HPLIP needs to be recompiled for the USE flags changes to take effect. If the module should permanently disabled it can be blacklisted to prevent automatic loading at boot time.

Load the '''''usblp''''' kernel module:
{{RootCmd|modprobe usblp}}
Unload the '''''usblp''''' kernel module:
{{RootCmd|modprobe -r usblp}}
Blacklist the '''''usblp''''' kernel module:
{{RootCmd|echo "blacklist usblp" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf}}

Parallel port connected devices require the following kernel options:
{{KernelBox|title=Optional: Parallel port printer support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Parallel port support  --->
        <*>   PC-style hardware
        [*]   IEEE 1284 transfer modes
    Character devices  --->
        <*> Parallel printer support
</pre>}}

The above two methods are usually already enabled within most kernels.

Network connected devices do not require special kernel drivers but basic kernel network support.

== Configuration ==

=== Printers and Faxes ===
{{Note|Make sure your USB printer is plugged into your computer or your network
printer into the network socket.}}

If installed with enabled ''qt4'' USE flag, use the "HP Device Manager" to configure your devices.

Alternatively you can run '''hp-setup''' in a terminal:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup}}

For network printer also specify the printer's IP address:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27}}

Afterwards you should restart the cups daemon:
{{RootCmd|rc-service cupsd restart}}

=== Scanners ===
Overall, scanners should just work and will be detected with XSane etc.

== Testing ==

=== Printer ===
After completing hp-setup you should be provided with the option of printing a test page. You can do this later using the "HP Device Manager" or the CUPS web interface which is located at http://localhost:631/.

=== Scanner ===
Use '''xsane''' and then press the preview button to ensure the scanner driver is installed and working properly.

== Upgrading ==

Every time when upgrading HPLIP run '''hp-setup -r''' to remove all printers and configure them again as described above in the configuration section.

== Binary plugins ==

There are some devices which require a binary plugin to use all functions the device provides. A list with devices requiring the binary plugin including the reasons why it is needed is available at the project's [http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/plugin.html homepage]. Gentoo currently does not support the binary plugin. '''hp-setup''' however tries to automatically install the plugin. The installed files are out of portage's control and are located under {{Path|/usr/share/hplip/data/firmware/}} {{Path|/usr/share/hplip/data/plugins/}} and {{Path|/usr/share/hplip/prnt/plugins/}}.
For installing just the plugin without configuring printer queues '''hp-plugin''' is available.
If installing the plugin fails with '''hp-setup''' or '''hp-plugin''' the plugin installer is available for download [http://www.openprinting.org/download/printdriver/auxfiles/HP/plugins/ here]. To install the plugin the downloaded *.run file has to executed in a shell:

{{RootCmd|sh hplip-version-plugin.run}}

Afterwards follow the instructions of the installer similar to '''hp-setup''' or '''hp-plugin'''

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Printing Paused ===
PROBLEM: Printing does not immediately start after submitting a job.

SOLUTION: Check the CUPS printer administration interface and make sure the printer is not in a paused state.

=== Error on install "File "./plugin_install.py", line 78 except ImportError, e:" ===
PROBLEM: A snipping of the error follows.

{{RootCmd|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27|output=<pre>
[...SNIP...]

----------------------
| INSTALLING PLUG-IN |

    except ImportError, e:
                      ^

error: Python gobject/dbus may be not installed
</pre>}}

SOLUTION: Python 3 is set as main python interpreter. HPLP currently does not work correct with python 3. Switching back to python 2 by using '''eselect python''' fixes this. 

{{Note|Python 2 is still the recommended python interpreter for Gentoo. When using python 3 you should be aware of potential issues.}}

This is further documented at the {{Bug|718069|site=launchpad}}

=== HPLIP ebuild Upgrades Do Not Upgrade Binary Plugin(s) ===
PROBLEM: The HPLIP ebuild itself does not upgrade the binary plugin(s) when the ebuild is upgraded.  A symptom of this problem, you may get segfaults when starting XSane. (i.e. The HP LaserJet M1522nf requires a binary plugin for using the scanning feature.)

SOLUTION 1: Following the upgrade instructions should take care of this as '''hp-setup''' tries to upgrade the plugin. If there are still problems hplip comes with '''hp-plugin''' which can be used for installing the plugin. As a last resort one can download the plugin from [http://www.openprinting.org/download/printdriver/auxfiles/HP/plugins/ OpenPrinting] and install it manually.

SOLUTION 2: As of lately, also running 'hp-info' (with hplip built with the qt4 USE Flag) via a user terminal will eventually auto detect the version conflict of the binary part of the installed driver and ask the user to automatically upgrade, including issuing a prompt for the root password via a qt4 widget prompt.

=== Printing Weird Characters ===
PROBLEM: The printout contains weird looking characters.

SOLUTION: The printer likely can not handle Postscript Level 3 output. To work around, the printer's PPD file needs to be edited by replacing '*LanguageLevel: "3"' with '*LanguageLevel: "2"'.

See {{Bug|277404|site=launchpad}} which was initially opened in the year 2008 and {{Bug|19640|site=fdo}} for more information.

{{Note|<nowiki>Bug #277404 has not been fixed as of =net-print/hplip-3.13, and the PPD file installed is still being assigned "LanguageLevel 3" when specific HP printers do not support level 3!</nowiki>}}

{{Note| Even MS Windows prints using Postscript Language Level 2.  Even though the graphical interface might state Level 3, the graphic interface is lying and instead the code is hacked to print at Level 2.  Some distributions such as Ubuntu might also be hacked to print at Level 2, while also lying to users making them think they're printing at Level 2.  These are extremely significant signs of poor coding.}}
{{Note| Sometimes using Infinality can create some unknow issues, if nothing works try disabling Infinality.}}

=== SANE/XSANE Not Finding HPAIO Scanner? ===
First some history, if I'm correct on the sane-backend for accessing HPLIP hpaio devices.

SANE/XSANE SANE_BACKENDS or media-gfx/sane-backends used to require 'hp' or the 'hp' USE Flag.  Currently, the 'hp' sane-backend appears no longer needed for accessing HPLIP hpaio devices.  Also, if no SANE_BACKENDS devices are specified within the make.conf, almost all sane-backend devices are compiled by default during compilation of media-gfx/sanebackends package.  This appears to go against the main purpose of the USE flag function and inhibits a very long compilation on x86 platforms.  So it may be privy to still insert SANE_BACKENDS="hp" (or at least some driver even though it is not needed) within the make.conf file or within the package USE Flags.  There also used to be an older SANE_BACKENDS="sane_backends_hp" format as well, so ensure you've updated to the newer format.

More current and relevant areas to check for resolving this specific problem, check and make sure the user is within the scanner, usb and/or lp groups of the /etc/groups file.  If "scaneimage -L" and the HPLIP "hp-scan" works as root, something must be awry with permissions!  If you cannot even scan as root, especially with HPLIP's hp-scan, check to ensure the plugin is properly installed/updated and the device is connected.

One more area to check and you know you likely have all your group permissions correct by performing test file writes, and you're able to scan as root but still not as a user; make sure files within the folder "/etc/sane.d" (more specifically the "/etc/sane.d/dll.conf" file) are able to be read as a user!  (NOTE: Both HPLIP "hp-scan -g" and "scanimage -L" reported no useful information concerning this permissions problem!)
