'''HPLIP''' ('''HP''' '''L'''inux '''I'''maging and '''P'''rinting) contains print, scan and fax drivers for HP devices.

== Do you require HPLIP? ==
Most HP printers do not require HPLIP to successfully print from. You can likely use a default CUPS install, which likely provides adequate drivers or PPD files.

If you have a MFD with a scanner feature, then you will require HPLIP as it is likely the scanner driver is provided only as a binary blob.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
USB connected devices require basic kernel USB support.

Network connected devices require basic kernel network support.

Parallel connected devices require the following kernel options:
{{Kernel|Optional: Parallel port printer support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Parallel port support  --->
        <*>   PC-style hardware
        [*]   IEEE 1284 transfer modes
    Character devices  --->
        <*> Parallel printer support
</pre>}}

Most devices sold as of this writing are connected using either USB or Network ports.  Parallel port devices are considered legacy and likely no longer sold.  If you're one of the few whom have a parallel device and it works, more power to you for having no need for buying a new device!

=== Software ===
Install {{Package|net-print/hplip}}:
{{USEflag|package=net-print/hplip
|X+yes
|doc
|fax
|hpcups+yes+yes
|hpijs++no
|kde+yes
|libnotify+yes
|minimal++no
|policykit+yes
|parport
|qt4+yes
|scanner
|snmp
|static-ppds
}}

{{Note|Also add ''SANE_BACKENDS{{=}}"sane_backends_hp" to your {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.}}

{{Emerge|hplip}}

== Configuration ==
=== Printers and Faxes ===
If installed with enabled ''qt4'' USE flag, use the "HP Device Manager" to configure your devices.

If not or the program doesn't work for you, run '''hp-setup''' in a terminal:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup}}

For network printer also specify the printer's IP address:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27}}

=== Scanners Requiring the Binary Plugin ===
Overall, scanners should just work if they do not require a binary plugin and will be detected with XSane with the following file configurations.
{{File|/etc/make.conf|Add or Modify to File|
 <pre>SANE_BACKENDS="sane_backends_hp"</pre>
}}

{{File|/etc/sane.d/dll.conf|Add or Modify to File|
 <pre>hpaio</pre>
}}

For those requiring the binary plugin for networked scanning devices using the following for installing and upgrading.
{{RootCmd|hp-plugin -i 192.168.1.27}}

{{Note|The above instructions are untested with any open sourced HP Scanners.  Please modify as necessary if you have one! (ie. HP Photosmart 6510?)}}

{{Note|After each HPLIP ebuild upgrade, users need to manually update their binary plugins as the ebuild has no current abilities for updating the binary plugins!  See Gentoo Bug #423599}}

== Testing ==

=== Printer ===
The above command, should provide an option to test print. If it fails printing due to lack of X as root, use your CUPS web interface located at http://localhost:631/ for printing a test page.

=== Scanner ===
Use '''xsane''' and then press the preview button to ensure the binary scanner driver is installed and working properly.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Buggy hp-setup ===
Install HPLIP with ''snmp'' USE flag and try again.

=== /usr/libexec/cups/backend/hp failed ===
rc-service cupsd stop

cp /etc/cups/printers.conf  /etc/cups/printers.conf.20121104

Edit this " /etc/cups/printers.conf" and remove the lines prefixed with "State", "Reason" and "Type".

Upon saving the file and restarting the cupsd daemon, printing should resume.

=== Error on install "File "./plugin_install.py", line 78 except ImportError, e:" ===

PROBLEM: A snipping of the error follows.

{{RootCmd
|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27|output=<pre>

[...SNIP...]

</pre>}}

WORK AROUND: The cause is because incompatible coding is being used with Python 3 within hp-setup.  To work around, "eselect python list" and "eselect python (set to version 2)".  Just remember to revert back to Python 3 version when you are finished installing.

{{RootCmd
|eselect python list}}

RESOLUTION: This bug is further documented at the following link and there appears to be no fix since 2011.11.16 as of 2012.11.18!

=== HPLIP Ebuild Upgrades Do Not Upgrade Binary Plugin(s) ===
PROBLEM: The HPLIP Ebuild does not upgrade the binary plugin(s) when the ebuild is upgraded.  A symptom of this problem, you may get segfaults when starting XSane.  (ie. The HP LaserJet M1522nf requires a binary plugin for using the scanning feature.)

WORK AROUND #1: Use '''hp-plugin -i 192.168.1.27''' to manually upgrade the binary (scanner) plugin(s).  This method is currently untested.

WORK AROUND #2: Delete all printers within CUPS and use '''hp-setup''' after upgrading the HPLIP Ebuild.  This method does work.
