'''linux-headers''' is [[Article description::a package providing the [[kernel|Linux kernel]] headers.]] These are part of the kernel, although they are shipped separately (further reasoning is available: [https://web.archive.org/web/20171219160722/http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Kernel/usr-src-linux-symlink.html]). The headers act as an interface between internal kernel components and also between [[Wikipedia:User space|userspace]] and the kernel. Packages like {{Package|sys-libs/glibc}} depend on the kernel headers.

== FAQ ==

A common question regarding linux-headers is whether you need to keep them synced with your kernel version. The answer is no. You can have a ''newer'' linux-headers version then your running kernel binary.

So for example, if you have kernel 4.1 installed, you can have linux-headers 4.4. If you compile your '''glibc''' with this newer headers and later upgrade to kernel 4.4, you will be able to use the new features of this kernel without recompiling '''glibc''' again.
