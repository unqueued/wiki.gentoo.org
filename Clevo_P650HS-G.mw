== Installation ==

The dual graphics cards setup would cause problems during installation. To install the system, you can either turn integrated graphics off in UEFI mode or use Bios mode to install (you may still need to turn of integrated graphics)

=== Use UEFI mode ===

1. Turn off integrated graphics card by switching to DISCRETE mode in bios (not doing so might cause live system to freeze) 
2. Boot into LiveDVD and follow installation guide
If you want to use it in Discrete mode:
Turn on relevant kernel options of the Nvidia card and install the drivers
If you want to use it in hybrid mode:
Turn on options of Intel and Nvidia cards, include Intel firmware, and do not turn on any frame buffer options.
Here is a list of options that should work for kernel 4.14.16

}}
Install drivers, grub, initramfs.
Turn on integrated graphics by switching to MSHYBRID mode in bios and the system should boot without freezing. To use X, extra setups are needed.
Only boot loader GRUB is tested.

=== Kernel ===

== Configuration ==

Xorg might need additional configurations for use in hybrid mode.

=== Xorg configuration ===

If you want to use it in Hybrid mode, you might need to specify modesetting driver options.
