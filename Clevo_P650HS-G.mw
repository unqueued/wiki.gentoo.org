== Installation ==

The dual graphics cards setup would cause problems during installation. To install the system, either 
* turn integrated graphics off in UEFI mode (switch to DISCRETE mode in bios) and then boot into UEFI enabled live media (X works with the current live DVD). Integrated graphics can be properly setup and turned back on for later use.

or 

* boot into live media in bios mode for installation (integrated graphics may still need to be turned off to boot properly into a live environment). 

=== General graphics kernel options for hybrid mode ===

* To set up the system for use in hybrid mode, kernel options should be set up properly for Intel graphics. Refer to  [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Intel Intel]
* To prevent freeze, leave all frame buffer devices unselected. 
* To use Bumblebee, Nouveau should not be selected. 

Here is a list of options that should work for kernel 4.14.16
{{KernelBox|title=Enable support for these hardware drivers|1=Device Drivers  --->
    Generic Driver Options  --->
        -*- Userspace firmware loading support
        [*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary

        -*- Backlight & LCD device support  --->
        [*] Bootup logo  --->
}}

* Turn on integrated graphics by switching to MSHYBRID mode in bios and the system should boot without freezing if initramfs and grub is configured properly. To use X, extra setups are needed.

== Configuration ==

=== Xorg ===

To use X in Hybrid mode, you might need to specify modesetting driver options.
Example:

{{FileBox|title=xorg conf example for hybrid mode||filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/modesetting.conf|1=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/modesetting.conf 
Section "Module"
  Load "modesetting"
EndSection

Section "Device"
  Identifier    "Intel HD630"
  Driver        "modesetting"
  BusID         "00:02:0"
  Option        "AccelMethod"   "glamor"
  Option        "DRI"           "3"
EndSection
}}

=== Bumblebee === 
To use the Nvidia card, set up Bumblebee.

=== VGA passthrough === 

The Nvidia card can function properly when passed suing VFIO and KVM to linux virtual machines using Nouveau (extra setup required). However, as Nouveau support for Nvidia's 10-series card is currently severely limited, being able to do so does not provide much benefit other than the ability to use external displays. The possibility of using proprietary Nvidia drivers in VM (including running Windows) is yet to be explored.

=== Keyboard backlight ===

[https://bitbucket.org/tuxedocomputers/clevo-xsm-wmi Clevo-xsm-wmi] can be used for keyboard backlight control.
