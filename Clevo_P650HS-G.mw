== Installation ==

The dual graphics cards setup would cause problems during installation. To install the system, either 
* turn integrated graphics off in UEFI mode and then boot into UEFI enabled live media (X works with the current live DVD). Integrated graphics can be properly setup and turned back on for later use.

or 

* boot into live media in bios mode for installation (integrated graphics may still need to be turned off to boot properly into live environment). 

=== Kernel options for  ===

# Turn off integrated graphics card by switching to DISCRETE mode in bios (not doing so might cause live system to freeze) 
# Boot into LiveDVD and follow installation guide

*If want to use it in Discrete mode:
Turn on relevant kernel options of the Nvidia card and install the drivers
*If want to use it in hybrid mode:
Turn on options of Intel and Nvidia cards, include Intel firmware, and do not turn on any frame buffer devices.

Here is a list of options that should work for kernel 4.14.16

Install drivers, grub, initramfs.
Turn on integrated graphics by switching to MSHYBRID mode in bios and the system should boot without freezing. To use X, extra setups are needed.
Only boot loader GRUB is tested.

== Configuration ==

=== Xorg ===

To use X in Hybrid mode, you might need to specify modesetting driver options.
Example:

{{FileBox|title=xorg conf example for hybrid mode||filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/modesetting.conf|1=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/modesetting.conf 
Section "Module"
  Load "modesetting"
EndSection

Section "Device"
  Identifier    "Intel HD630"
  Driver        "modesetting"
  BusID         "00:02:0"
  Option        "AccelMethod"   "glamor"
  Option        "DRI"           "3"
EndSection
