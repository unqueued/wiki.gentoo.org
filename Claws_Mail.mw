Claws Mail is a mail client forked from [http://sylpheed.sraoss.jp/en/ Sylpheed]. In [http://www.claws-mail.org/faq/index.php/General_Information Claws Mail FAQ], it is said: ''Claws Mail has many extra features compared to Sylpheed and is more powerful, yet is just as fast, lightweight and stable.'' Only one inaccuracy: like Sylpheed, Claws Mail is ''very'' fast…

It is actively developped, can be extended by many plugins, and imports natively mbox mailboxes coming from Thunderbird for example. It's mailbox format is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MH_Message_Handling_System MH], mbox format can be used with a plugin. Claws Mail can't write HTML emails (Keep it Simple…) but can read them with several plugins.

For Gentoo Linux it is provided as {{Package|mail-client/claws-mail}} package for all architectures excepted {{Keyword|ia64}}.

Set <code>bogofilter</code> USE flag to compile the plugin with Claws Mail.

* Hard way: [http://spamassassin.apache.org/ Spamassassin] is a huge mail filtering system, using bayesian filter and external spam definitions ressources. It must be extensively configured and a daemon (spamd) must be running for Claws Mail to use it. It is the prefered spam filter for a mail server. Set <code>spamassassin</code> USE flag to compile the plugin with Claws Mail. Some information can be found in [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/amvisd_spamassassin_clamav|Complete Virtual Mail Server]] and [[Mailfiltering_Gateway|Mailfiltering Gateway]] Gentoo Wiki pages.
