Claws Mail is a mail client forked from Sylpheed. In [http://www.claws-mail.org/faq/index.php/General_Information Claws Mail FAQ], it is said: ''Claws Mail has many extra features compared to Sylpheed and is more powerful, yet is just as fast, lightweight and stable.'' Only one inaccuracy: Claws Mail is ''very'' fast…

It is actively developped, can be extended by many plugins, and imports natively mbox mailboxes coming from Thunderbird for example. It's mailbox format is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MH_Message_Handling_System MH], mbox format can be used with a plugin. Claws Mail can't write HTML emails (Keep it Simple…) but can read them with several plugins.

For Gentoo Linux it is provided as {{Package|mail-client/claws-mail}} package for all architectures excepted {{Keyword|ia64}}.

=== Plugins ===

Some plugins are compiled when their USE flag are set, like <code>bogofilter</code> or <code>spamassassin</code>.

Some others must be emerged, like {{Package|mail-client/claws-mail-rssyl}} to read RSS feeds, {{Package|mail-client/claws-mail-archive}} to archive mails directories, or {{Package|mail-client/claws-mail-fancy}} to display HTML emails. It is advised to set they USE flags, respectively <code>rss</code>, <code>archive</code> and <code>webkit</code> for these examples.

Get the list of Claws Mail plugins by issuing:

{{Cmd|emerge --search claws-mail}}

==== Spam Filtering ====

* Simple way: [http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/ Bogofilter] is a powerful bayesian filter which don't need to be configured. It quickly learns from user's spam or ham mails classification in Claws Mail. It is the prefered spam filter for a desktop computer. Set <code>bogofilter</code> USE flag to compile the plugin with Claws Mail.

* Hard way: [http://spamassassin.apache.org/ Spamassassin] is a huge mail filtering system, using bayesian filter and external spam definitions ressources. It must be extensively configured and a daemon (spamd) must be running for Claws Mail to use it. It is the prefered spam filter for a mail server. Set <code>spamassassin</code> USE flag to compile the plugin with Claws Mail. Some information can be found in [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/amvisd_spamassassin_clamav|Complete Virtual Mail Server]] and [[Mailfiltering_Gateway|Mailfiltering Gateway]] Gentoo Wiki pages.

=== Emerge ===

Make a {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use/claws-mail}} file to activate desired USE flags. Setting <code>bogofilter</code>, <code>pgp</code> and <code>archive</code> for example:

{{RootCmd|echo <nowiki>'mail-client/claws-mail bogofilter pgp archive'</nowiki> > /etc/portage/package.use/claws-mail}}

Then emerge Claws Mail:

{{Emerge|mail-client/claws-mail}}

Then emerge desired plugins, example for archive, HTML rendering and RSS feeds:

{{Emerge|emerge --ask mail-client/claws-mail-archive mail-client/claws-mail-fancy mail-client/claws-mail-rssyl}}
