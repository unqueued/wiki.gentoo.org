'''Privoxy''' is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy. Privoxy can be paired with [[Squid]] to provide filtering to it.



== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-proxy/privoxy}}

=== Emerge ===
To install Privoxy:
{{Emerge|net-proxy/privoxy}}

== Boot service ==

=== OpenRC ===

To start privoxy:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/privoxy start}}

To make privoxy start at boot:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add privoxy default}}

== Configuration ==

Browsers need to set the proxy configuration [http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/quickstart.html to address 127.0.0.1 and port 8118] in the browser proxy configuration or in a proxy plugin (like [https://getfoxyproxy.org/ foxyproxy]). Privoxy default configuration block ads and further configuration should edit files in {{Path|/etc/privoxy/}}.

=== Test filters ===
There is a way to test the filters that are applied to a specific site.

If privoxy is working correctly the next URL should be intercepted by privoxy

http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info

In this page it's possible to check why a page is filtered or what filters are applied to that site.
