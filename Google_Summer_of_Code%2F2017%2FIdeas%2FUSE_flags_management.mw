|USE flags management|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Write a tool to manage global and local USE flags as well as expand variables, review them, audit them, filter them based on various criteria, etc... Get inspiration from [https://github.com/Calchan/USEful USEful]. Integrate it to emaint. The code will have to be written in Python and use the Portage API.

As it is unlikely this is enough for 3 months of full-time work, you'll have to be creative enough to expand the features sets of USEful and/or emaint in a meaningful way.
