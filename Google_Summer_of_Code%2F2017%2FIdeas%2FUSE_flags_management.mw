{{GSoCIdea|USE flags management|year=2017|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Write a tool to manage global and local USE flags as well as expand variables, review them, audit them, filter them based on various criteria, etc... Get inspiration from:
* [https://github.com/Calchan/USEful USEful]
* [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/gentoolkit.git/tree/bin/euse euse]
* [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/gentoolkit.git/tree/pym/gentoolkit/enalyze enalyze].
Integrate it into emaint. The code will have to be written in Python and use the Portage API.

As it is unlikely this is enough for 3 months of full-time work, you'll have to be creative enough to expand the features sets of USEful and/or emaint in a meaningful way.
