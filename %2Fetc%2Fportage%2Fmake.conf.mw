'''make.conf''' is one of the ways to customize the Portage environment on a global level. This configuration will apply to every package that is emerged, and controls many elements of Portage's functionality, such as global USE flags, language options, Portage mirrors, and so on.

An example setup can be found at {{path|/usr/share/portage/config/make.conf.example}}.

== Precedence == 
Portage configuration is not limited to {{path|make.conf}}, global settings defined in this file are refined on a per-package basis in the {{path|/etc/portage/package.*}} files, as well as the local environment.

{{path|make.conf}} may exist as {{path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} or {{path|/etc/make.conf}} (or both), with the settings from {{path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} taking precedence.

== Variables ==
There are many possible variables to customize in make.conf, but only the most commonly used are explained in detail here. For more information, and the full list of variables, consult the make.conf manpage.

{{Note|Different configurations will require different variables to be set up. Do not treat the following as a definitive list, or a minimum set of requirements.}}
