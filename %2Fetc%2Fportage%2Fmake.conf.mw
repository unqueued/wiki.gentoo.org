{{Stub}}

{{Path|make.conf}} is one of the ways to customize the Portage environment on a global level. This configuration will apply to every package that is emerged, and controls many elements of Portage's functionality, such as global USE flags, language options, Portage mirrors, and so on.

An example setup can be found at {{path|/usr/share/portage/config/make.conf.example}}

== Precedence == 

Portage configuration is not limited to {{path|make.conf}}, global settings defined in this file are refined on a per-package basis in the {{path|/etc/portage/package.*}} files, as well as the local environment.

{{path|make.conf}} may exist as {{path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} or {{path|/etc/make.conf}} (or both), with the settings from {{path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} taking precedence.

== Variables ==

There are many possible variables to customize in {{Path|make.conf}}, but only the most commonly used are explained in detail here. For more information, and the full list of variables, consult the {{Path|make.conf}} [[man page]].

{{Note|Different configurations will require different variables to be set up. Do not treat the following as a definitive list, or a minimum set of requirements.}}

=== CHOST ===

This variable is passed through the configure step of ebuilds to set the build-host of the system. See the [[CHOST]] article. Note that the profile already should have defined the appropriate CHOST.

=== CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS ===

These flags are given when C or C++ packages are compiled to modify the behavior of the compiler. Not all packages will utilize these variables, as some programs require a specific set of compilation flags in order to compile correctly. 

While setting proper <code>CFLAGS</code> can increase the speed and stability of the system, absurd settings (e.g. <code>-O3 -fast-math -funroll-all-loops</code>) will more likely cripple the system rather than it blazing fast.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Sane CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS|lang=bash|1=
# use the 2nd optimization level (-O3 can be unstable), 
# use pipes rather than temporary files for compilation 
# stages, and tune the binary to make use of native
# processor capabilities
CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -march=native"
# These flags apply to C++ as well
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
}}

{{Note|The make.conf manpage does not indicate that <code>CFLAGS</code> is an incremental flag [hopefully someone just forgot to mention it] meaning it should be used in the following fashion to avoid clobbering flags set by the profile: CFLAGS{{=}}"${CFLAGS} -O2 -pipe -march{{=}}native"}}

{{Note|Also consider appending <code>-g</code> or even <code>-ggdb2</code> to be a better Linux bug reporter. To avoid the performance hit of running debug builds it is advised to split debug symbols out of binaries and save them separately before stripping the binaries as usual. This can be achieved with FEATURES{{=}}"splitdebug compressdebug" which requires dev-util/debugedit to be installed and both binutils and gdb built with USE{{=}}zlib}}

=== [https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2015-01-28-cpu_flags_x86-introduction.html CPU_FLAGS_X86] ===

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
CPU_FLAGS_X86="mmx mmxext sse sse2 sse3 ssse3"
}}

=== FEATURES ===
{{:FEATURES}}

=== GENTOO_MIRRORS ===

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
GENTOO_MIRRORS="URIs"
}}

This variable defines a list of Gentoo mirrors to check before downloading from the source defined in the ebuild. Properly chosen mirrors will generally be able to offer faster download speeds. Try using [[Mirrorselect]] to find the fastest mirror server. 

See also http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors2.xml.

=== [[Localization/Guide#LINGUAS|LINGUAS]] ===

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
LINGUAS="de pt_BR en en_US en_GB"
}}

=== MAKEOPTS ===

This variable is used to specify arguments passed to make when packages are built from source. Make can be told to run multiple jobs in parallel (a potentially substantial speed increase, depending on processor). This can be done either through <code>--jobs N</code> (short form: <code>-jN</code>), which runs <code>N</code> (number) jobs at a time (without an argument, <code>-j</code> will flood the processor with as many jobs as possible, and is not recommended). For example, to run three jobs:

{{RootCmd|emerge --jobs 3 package/atom}}

Another option is <code>--load-average N</code> (short form <code>-lN</code>), which will have make keep the load average of the system to <code>N</code>, however many parallel tasks that ends up being or up to limit set by <code>--jobs</code> if it is set as well.

=== PORTDIR ===

This variable is deprecated in favor of settings in [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/repos.conf repos.conf].

=== PORTDIR_OVERLAY ===

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
PORTDIR_OVERLAY="[path] [different-path] [etc...]"
}}

Defines locations of local Portage overlays. Ebuilds included in the listed overlays will be installable as usual through <tt>emerge</tt>. 

To use [[layman]] overlays, the following should be included in {{Path|make.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
source "/var/lib/layman/make.conf"
}}

=== USE ===

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="space delimited list of USE flags"
}}

The USE variable allows the setting of a common set of USE flags for all packages. These are flags for a common set of package functionality desired (such as X11 or PulseAudio capability), or system capabilities, like SSE or MMX instruction support.  

Do not set package-specific USE flags here, those should be set instead in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}}

For a list of the available global USE flags to be set in {{Path|make.conf}}, see http://www.gentoo.org/dyn/use-index.xml and {{path|/usr/portage/profiles/use.desc}}

=== Licenses ===

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=To accept all licenses on all packages (not a good idea)|lang=bash|1=
ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"
}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=To accept free software only|lang=bash|1=
ACCEPT_LICENSE="-* @FREE"
}}
