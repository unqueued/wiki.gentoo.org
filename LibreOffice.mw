'''LibreOffice''' is a full office productivity suite. It's a successor of the OpenOffice.org and strives to be a better and less bloated office suite.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-office/libreoffice}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|app-office/libreoffice}}:

{{Emerge|app-office/libreoffice|params+=--verbose}}

=== Binary installation ===

Since LibreOffice is such a large package to compile, it is also offered in pre-compiled binaries in {{Package|app-office/libreoffice-bin}}.

{{emerge|app-office/libreoffice-bin|params+=--verbose}}

The binary packages are compiled such that they fit to the libraries of a stable Gentoo system. You will encounter difficulties if you try to use them on an ~arch system; this is not supported.
