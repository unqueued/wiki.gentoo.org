Libreoffice package is sucessor of the OpenOffice.org and strives forward for better and less bloated office suite.

== Install ==
* libreoffice - core package
* libreoffice-l10n - translations and templates

You can install them by simply running:
{{Emerge|app-office/libreoffice}}

The libreoffice package provide following useflags:
* ''binfilter'' : Enables support for legacy StarOffice 5.x file formats, makes the compilation quite longer.
* ''branding'' : Enable nice Gentoo splash screen.
* ''dbus'' : Enable dbus communication.
* ''debug'' : Enable debug paths for libreoffice, do NOT enable unless you know what you are doing.
* ''eds'' : Enables support for Evolution-Data-Server, which is usefull for evolution users.
* ''gnome'' : Adds GNOME technologies support (GVFS,...).
* ''graphite'' : Enable support for non-Roman fonts, eg.: does your language look like garbage, you need this :)
* ''gstreamer'' : Adds support for multimedia content managing within your documents.
* ''gtk'' : Adds support for GTK 2 and 3.
* ''java'' : Enables import xml filters and various wizzards (if you can live without those two disable this useflag as it still use quite few internal libs).
* ''jemalloc'' : Use dev-libs/jemalloc for allocations, which is faster than system one.
* ''kde'' : Builds the Qt4/KDE frontend.
* ''mysql'' : Builds support for MySQL within ''base'' application.
* ''nsplugin'' : Build plugin for browsers supporting the Netscape plugin architecture (if you are not using it you should rather disable this as it is fixed starting with 3.5.0 release).
* ''odk'' : Install the development files and documentation.
* ''opengl'' : Adds support for OpenGL via mesa.
