'''Logrotate''' is a tool to periodically rotate (archive), delete, and optionally compress and/or mail historic log files.  Logrotate ships with, and is invoked by a {{path|/etc/cron.daily}} cron job.

== Install ==

{{emerge|logrotate}}

== Configuration ==

Accelerating log rotation can be very useful to setting up log rotate.  Initial purging of extremely large logs, getting familiar with day to day messages, cleaning up your system, and setting up intrusion prevention systems can benefit greatly from this.  Daily log rotation encourages administrators to be proactive about security, and system health rather than reactive.

{{fileBox|filename=/etc/logrotate.conf|1=
# rotate log files weekly
#weekly
daily
}}

{{path|/etc/logrotate.d}} contains all log rotate settings and directives.
