{{Package|net-firewall/ipset}} is a tool for [[Iptables]] successor if IPpool is an administration tool for IP sets. 

''IPSet is used to set up, maintain and inspect so called IP sets in the Linux kernel. Depending on  the  type of  the  set,  an IP set may store IP(v4/v6) addresses, (TCP/UDP) port numbers, IP and MAC address pairs, IP address and port number pairs, etc.''

== Filtering ==

The simple following script can be used to filter IP adresses based on a file that have to be retrieved on the intertubes, and then create or update [[Iptables]] firewall rules.

{{File|~/.scripts/ips||<pre>
#!/bin/sh
opt="hash:ip --netmask 24 --hashsize 64"
datadir=/var/lib/ipset
target=http://feeds.dshield.org/block.txt
wget -qNP $datadir $target || exit
set="${target##*/}"
tmp=${set/txt/tmp}
ipset create $tmp $opt
networks=($(grep -E '^[0-9]' $datadir/$set | sed -rne 's/(^([0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}).*$/\1/p'))
ip=${#networks[*]}
while [ $((--ip)) -ge 0 ]; do
    ipset add $tmp ${networks[ip]}
done
ipset create -exist $set $opt
ipset swap $tmp $set
ipset destroy $tmp
echo "IPSet: $set updated"
unset -v ip networks opt set tmp</pre>}}

The previous script is just a simple way to retrieve different or various IPSet table and make use of an up to date filtering.

The script just create an new table and swap and destroy a previous set if there's one. For a more refined script see [https://raw.github.com/tokiclover/dotfiles/master/.scripts/ips.bash ips.bash] or a [[zsh]] version [https://raw.github.com/tokiclover/dotfiles/master/.scripts/ips.zsh ips.zsh].

Also see Gentoo Forums [ http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-863121.html topic 863121] for the original scripts, written by gentoo user BoneKracker, that the ipset-related substance of the script above and those at the links were copied from without giving credit.
