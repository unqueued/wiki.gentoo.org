''IPSet is used to set up, maintain and inspect so called IP sets in the Linux kernel. Depending on  the  type of  the  set,  an IP set may store IP(v4/v6) addresses, (TCP/UDP) port numbers, IP and MAC address pairs, IP address and port number pairs, etc.'' - Wikipedia

IPSet is a tool for [[Iptables]], successor of IPpool. It is an administration tool for IP sets which can be added to IPTables rules to filter out networks. 

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===
You will need to configure your kernel to support ipset.

=== Kernel ===
For example, if ipset support is compiled as a module:

{{KernelBox|title=Kernel settings for ipset|1=
[*] Networking support  --->
    Networking options  --->
    [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter) --->
        <M>  IP set support --->

as well as
             Core Netfilter Configuration --->       
                <M>  set target and match support

}}

then select the desired ipset types.

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-firewall/ipset|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|net-firewall/ipset}}:
|modules+yes
}}

=== Emerge ===

Install IPSet:

{{Emerge|net-firewall/ipset}}

== Filtering ==

The simple following script can be used to filter IP addresses based on a file that have to be retrieved on the internet, and then create or update iptables firewall rules:

{{FileBox|filename=~/scripts/ips.sh|title=Example IPSet script|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
opt="hash:net --hashsize 64"
datadir=/var/lib/ipset
target=http://feeds.dshield.org/block.txt
wget -qNP $datadir $target {{!}}{{!}} exit
set=IPBlock
tmp=${set}-tmp
ipset create $tmp $opt
networks="$(grep -E '^[0-9]' $datadir/$set {{!}} sed -rne 's/(^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}).*$/\1/p')"
for i in $networks; do
    ipset add $tmp ${i}/24
done
ipset create -exist $set $opt &&
ipset swap $tmp $set &&
ipset destroy $tmp &&
echo "IPSet: $set updated"
unset -v i networks opt set tmp
}}

The above script is just a simple way to retrieve different or various IPSet table and make use of an up to date filtering.

The script creates a new table and swap and destroys a previous set if one exists. For a more refined script see the following examples:

* [https://github.com/tokiclover/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/ips.bash ips.bash] - [[bash]] version
* [https://github.com/tokiclover/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/ips.zsh ips.zsh] - [[zsh]] version

Save the rules to a file and start IPSet init service:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/ipset save||/etc/init.d/ipset start||rc-update add ipset boot}}

The previous network filtering can be added to iptables with the following command:

{{RootCmd|iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set IPBlock src,dst -j Drop}}
