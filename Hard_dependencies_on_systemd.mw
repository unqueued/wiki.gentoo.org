== A systemd free system ==

Ideally packages should not depend on a specific init system, however a number do:

* {{Package|gnome-base/gnome}} - GNOME depends on {{C|systemd-logind}}<ref>Olav Vitters, [https://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2013/09/25/gnome-and-logindsystemd-thoughts GNOME and logind+systemd thoughts], September 25th, 2013. Retrieved on July 18th, 2018.</ref>. There are ways to produce a systemd-free GNOME, see Dantrell B.'s [[GNOME/GNOME_Without_systemd|GNOME without systemd project]].

* {{Package|x11-wm/mutter}} (<kbd>USE="wayland" emerge mutter</kbd>) - Mutter's native (KMS) backend requires {{C|systemd-logind}}. Building the native backend is optional, and enabled by the {{Path|configure}} script's <code>--enable-native-backend</code> option. This option is turned on when the <code>wayland</code> [[USE_flag|USE flag]] is set. Mutter 3.28.1 allows building the native backend with [[elogind]] as an alternative to systemd<ref>[https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/blob/34644b2133241efe25794b57ddd18e6d9517cc0b/NEWS NEWS file] for mutter-3.28.1
 and [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/commit/06c357d7819cf2a648e57efe947f5a3cca7d74d2 the commit that introduced the feature].</ref>, but this version is not in Gentoo's repository yet. If or when more recent versions get added, >=x11-wm/mutter-3.28.1 ''should'' specify a <code>|| ( sys-apps/systemd sys-auth/elogind )</code> dependency.

* {{Package|www-misc/profile-sync-daemon}} - This package requires systemd. Upstream does not want to provide init scripts for other inits

* {{Package|net-misc/netctl}} This package requires systemd. unit files only provided. makes use of unitfiles and systemctl to interact with the system

*{{Package|app-admin/abrt}} - This package includes three daemons, {{C|abrt_dump_journal_core}}, {{C|abrt_dump_journal_oops}} and {{C|abrt_dump_journal_xorg}}, that extract core dumps, oopses and Xorg crashes, respectively, logged in systemd's journal. These tools are useless on Gentoo without systemd. However, the package's build system builds them unconditionally, and because they access the journal using the [https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd-journal.html sd-journal API of libsystemd], this results in a build failure if that library is not present. Assuming the rest of the package is still worth it without these programs, a possible workaround would be patching the build system to make it conditionally build the {{C|abrt_dump_journal_*}} daemons, based on a {{Path|configure}} script option that a modified ebuild could turn on or off depending on whether the <code>systemd</code> USE flag is set or unset. The package also ships service unit files only, but this can be solved by writing e.g. [[OpenRC]] service scripts with equivalent behaviour.
