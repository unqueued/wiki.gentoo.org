While some people might intuitively think that software packages should not generally depend on a specific init system, systemd itself is a large package that not only implements an init system, but also provides a number of other executables ({{C|systemd-udevd}}, {{C|systemd-logind}}, {{C|systemd-resolved}}, {{C|systemd-networkd}}, {{C|systemd-tmpfiles}}, {{C|systemd-localed}}, {{C|systemd-machined}}, {{C|systemd-nspawn}}, etc.), libraries ({{Path|libsystemd}}, {{Path|libudev}}), a [[PAM|PAM module]] ({{Path|pam_systemd.so}}) and a [[Systemd-boot|UEFI boot manager]] ({{Path|systemd-boot}}), among other components. So any other package that needs any of these components, even if it is just one, would pull {{Package|sys-apps/systemd}} as a dependency.

This article contains [[Article description::a (possibly partial) list of packages in Gentoo's repository that unconditionally require [[systemd]]]], i.e. that unconditionally list sys-apps/systemd in one or more of the corresponding ebuild's <var>xDEPEND</var> variables, thereby making systemd a 'hard dependency'.

== Packages ==

*{{Package|app-admin/abrt}} — This package includes three daemons, {{C|abrt_dump_journal_core}}, {{C|abrt_dump_journal_oops}} and {{C|abrt_dump_journal_xorg}}, that extract core dumps, oopses and Xorg crashes, respectively, logged in systemd's journal. These tools are useless on Gentoo without systemd. However, the package's build system builds them unconditionally, and because they access the journal using the [https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd-journal.html sd-journal API of libsystemd], this results in a build failure if that library is not present. Assuming the rest of the package is still worth it without these programs, a possible workaround would be patching the build system to make it conditionally build the {{C|abrt_dump_journal_*}} daemons, based on a {{Path|configure}} script option that a modified ebuild could turn on or off depending on the <code>systemd</code> USE flag state. The Gentoo ebuild installs [[OpenRC]] service scripts for other daemons though, in addition to upstream's service unit files.

* {{Package|gnome-extra/gnome-user-share}} — This package provides a daemon, {{C|gnome-user-share-webdav}}, that expects to be launched and supervised by a {{C|systemd}} process running as a user instance<ref>GNOME [https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=766331 bug 76631], "data: Add a way for gnome-user-share to be started via user systemd", and [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-user-share/commit/d6b6858f39afbf2e9dbd1cb04986d2260f418f11 accompanying commit] to the Git repository.</ref><ref>Bastien Nocera, [https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2016-September/msg00012.html e-mail] to GNOME Desktop Development List, September 5th, 2016.</ref> (i.e. {{C|systemd --user}}). It does so by installing a service unit file, {{Path|gnome-user-share-webdav.service}}, in {{Path|/usr/lib/systemd/user}}. It has no other runtime dependency on systemd, and no compile-time dependency on it.

* {{Package|gnome-extra/office-runner}} — This package provides a GTK+ 3 program, {{C|office-runner}}, that inhibits the low-level handling of the hardware lid switch by communicating over [[D-Bus]] with a process that implements the {{Path|org.freedesktop.login1}} interface, and invoking the <code>Inhibit()</code> method of its {{C|Manager}} object to take an [https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/inhibit inhibitor lock]. The {{Path|org.freedesktop.login1}} interface is implemented by {{C|systemd-logind}}, but also by [[elogind]], so it is not clear if this package couldn't also work with {{Package|sys-auth/elogind}}. The package does not have a compile-time dependency on systemd, it uses the GDBus interface of GLib ({{Package|dev-libs/glib}}).

* {{Package|www-misc/profile-sync-daemon}} — This package provides a [[bash]] script, {{C|profile-sync-daemon}}, intended to be periodically executed with a <code>resync</code> argument, and [[systemd#Timer_services|a timer unit file]] and accompanying service unit files to implement that with systemd. The script is likely usable on Gentoo without systemd regardless, e.g. with explicit [[cron]] setup by the user, provided the <var>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</var> environment variable is appropriately set as per the XDG Base Directory Specification<ref>XDG Base Directory Specification, [https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s03.html section "Environment variables"]. Retrieved on July 21st, 2018.</ref>. The {{C|psd preview}} command also uses {{C|systemctl is-active}} to show the status of its supplied units [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Profile-sync-daemon#Preview_.28parse.29_mode as part of its output] ("''Systemd service is currently active''", "''Systemd resync service is currently active''"), which is meaningless without systemd. Running the unmodified script would be ugly because of the shell's "''command not found''" error messages instead of the intended output, but otherwise nonfatal. Cosmetic patches could be applied to suppress that part of the output, and to fix other error messages that suggest systemd commands to the user in order to fix the situation that caused the error.

== Packages that formerly had a hard dependency on systemd ==

* {{Package|gnome-base/gnome}} — For versions 3.28 and earlier, the GNOME desktop environment contained components that required {{C|systemd-logind}}<ref>Olav Vitters, [https://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2013/09/25/gnome-and-logindsystemd-thoughts GNOME and logind+systemd thoughts], September 25th, 2013. Retrieved on July 18th, 2018.</ref> (among them, notably, its display manager, [[GNOME/gdm|GDM]]). However, as of version 3.30, Gentoo's packaging of GNOME allows it to work once again with [[sysvinit]] + [[OpenRC]] as the init system<ref>Gentoo website, News section, [https://www.gentoo.org/news/2019/03/27/gnome-330-openrc.html "Gentoo GNOME 3.30 for all init systems"], March 27th, 2019.</ref>. This is achieved through elogind; non-systemd GNOME profiles (i.e. those with 'gnome', but not 'systemd', in their name) set the <code>elogind</code> [[USE flag]] so that packages pull sys-auth/elogind as a dependency instead of sys-apps/systemd. Some GNOME packages, though, still unconditonally pull sys-apps/systemd, and are explictly listed above.

* {{Package|x11-wm/mutter}} with the <code>wayland</code> USE flag set (i.e. {{C|USE{{=}}wayland emerge mutter}}) — For versions 3.28.0 and earlier, Mutter's native (KMS) backend used to require {{C|systemd-logind}}. Building the native backend is optional, and enabled if the <code>wayland</code> USE flag is set. As of version 3.28.1, the native backend can alternatively be built with elogind<ref>[https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/blob/34644b2133241efe25794b57ddd18e6d9517cc0b/NEWS NEWS file] for mutter-3.28.1
 and [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/commit/06c357d7819cf2a648e57efe947f5a3cca7d74d2 the commit that introduced the feature].</ref>, and [[Portage]] will do so if the <code>elogind</code> USE flag is also set.
