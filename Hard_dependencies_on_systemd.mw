== A systemd free system ==

Ideally packages should not depend on a specific init system, however a number do:

* {{Package|gnome-base/gnome}} - GNOME depends on logind <ref>https://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2013/09/25/gnome-and-logindsystemd-thoughts/</ref>. There are ways to produce a Systemd-free GNOME <ref>https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1051428.html</ref>
* {{Package|x11-wm/mutter}} (<kbd>USE="wayland" emerge mutter</kbd>) - Mutter's native (KMS) backend requires {{C|systemd-logind}}. Building the native backend is optional, and enabled by the {{Path|configure}} script's <code>--enable-native-backend</code> option. This option is turned on when the <code>wayland</code> [[USE_flag|USE flag]] is set. Mutter 3.28.1 allows building the native backend with {{Package|sys-auth/elogind}} as an alternative to systemd, but this version is not in Gentoo's repository yet.
* {{Package|www-misc/profile-sync-daemon}} - This package requires systemd. Upstream does not want to provide init scripts for other inits
* {{Package|net-misc/netctl}} This package requires systemd. unit files only provided. makes use of unitfiles and systemctl to interact with the system

*{{Package|app-admin/abrt}} - This package requires systemd. This makes use of journald and #include systemd.h is intertwined in the code
