'''JFS''' ('''J'''ournaled '''F'''ile '''S'''ystem) is a 64-bit journaling [[filesystem]] created by IBM. An implementation for the Linux kernel is available as free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License. It is low on resource usage and comparatively fast doing all kinds of filesystem operations (as opposed to being specialized in some, e.g. [[XFS]] is fast with big files, but slower with small ones). As such JFS is especially good for usage with battery-powered devices such as laptops.
