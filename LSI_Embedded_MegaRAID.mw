Old '''LSI Embedded MegaRAID''' and '''Embedded RAID-II''' are ''fakeraid'' controllers. Historically they was only supported by proprietary driver named ''megasr'', available only as RPM for RHEL with kernels 2.6.18.x. Luckily most functions of megasr unofficially supported by opensource ''mptsas'' driver.

==No Warranty notice==

Since in this guide we use undocumented and unofficial features of mptsas drivers, there is '''NO WARRANTY''' of proper work of fakeraid. Please, before any actions on actual data perform backup first!

==Make mptsas to support controller ==

By default ''mptsas'' no handles with ''megasr''-compatible controllers. You need to provide corresponding PCI ID. First let's find out it:

{{RootCmd|lspci -nn|output=<pre>
...
08:00.0 SCSI storage controller [0100]: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic M1064E MegaRAID SAS [1000:0057] (rev 04)
...
</pre>}}

In this example PCI ID is 1000:0057. Give it to mpt-sas:

{{RootCmd
|modprobe mptsas
|echo "1000 0057" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/mptsas/new_id
}}

Now, if all goes right, your disks will be appear in system (check dmesg). For permanent effect you need add ''mptsas'' to {{Path|/etc/modules.d}} and 'echo "1000 0057" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/mptsas/new_id' to {{Path|/etc/local.d/mptsas.start}}:

{{RootCmd
|echo 'echo "1000 0057" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/mptsas/new_id' > /etc/local.d/mptsas.start
|chmod 755 /etc/local.d/mptsas.start
}}

==RAID capabilities ==
If RAID already configured in firmware and you need access to filesystem on it, you'll need to prepare your system as described [[Complete_Handbook/Software_RAID|here]] and install {{Package|sys-fs/mdadm}} package. mdadm daemon will automatically take RAID configuration and provide it to system as /dev/mdX block device. At first time mdadm will start resynchronization, that OK.
