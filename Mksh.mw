{{c|mksh}} is the MirBSD Korn Shell, [[Article description::an actively developed free implementation of the Korn Shell programming language and a successor to the Public Domain Korn Shell]] ({{c|pdksh}}). It is developed as part of [https://www.mirbsd.org/main.htm the MirOS Project] as native Bourne/POSIX/Korn shell for MirOS BSD, but also to be readily available under other UNIX-like operating systems. It targets users who desire a compact, fast, reliable, secure shell not cut off modern extensions, with unicode support.

Because of its speed, POSIX compliance, and advanced features, it is ideally suited for scripting. But it can serve very well as a login shell too. It is used as default shell on [[Android]].
