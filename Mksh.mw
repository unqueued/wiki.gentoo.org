'''mksh''' is [https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm the MirBSD Korn Shell], an actively developed free implementation of the Korn Shell programming language and a successor to the Public Domain Korn Shell (pdksh). It is developed as part of [https://www.mirbsd.org/main.htm the MirOS Project] as native Bourne/POSIX/Korn shell for MirOS BSD, but also to be readily available under other UNIX-like operating systems. It targets users who desire a compact, fast, reliable, secure shell not cut off modern extensions, with unicode support.

Because of its speed, posix compliance, and advanced features, it is ideally suited for scripting. But it can serve very well as a login shell too. It is used as default shell on [[Android]].

== Installation ==
{{Emerge|app-shells/mksh}}
The package offers no useflags. Installed size is about 280K on an amd64 system (vs. 721K for bash-4).

To make mksh your default login shell, you can run:
{{Cmd|chsh -s /bin/mksh}}
