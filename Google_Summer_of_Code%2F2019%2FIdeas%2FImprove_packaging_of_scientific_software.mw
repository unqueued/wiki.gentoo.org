{{GSoCIdea|year=2019|Improve packaging of scientific software|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Many scientific software in Gentoo needs more care, e.g. you can:
* package recent versions of [http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html Pythia], [https://hepmc.web.cern.ch/hepmc/ HepMC], and other HEP software;
* package machine learning toolkits: [https://www.tensorflow.org/ tensorflow], [https://keras.io/ keras], and [http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/ caffe] for starting (possibly with an option of picking up [https://github.com/intel/caffe Intel patches] for high performance);
* package recent versions of free software Intel tools like: [https://01.org/daal daal] and others.
