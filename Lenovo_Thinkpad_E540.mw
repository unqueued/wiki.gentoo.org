== Hardware details ==
TODO

= Issues =
* If the device has an UEFI Firmware version >1.61 it will not resume from suspend
(see [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1331077 this link] for
more information)
* Sometimes, when the device resumes from suspend, the power LED will blink
* Sometimes, when the device resumes from suspend, the hotkeys are no longer
working

= Workarounds =
When the device resumes from suspend, the Wifi will no longer work. This seems to be a problem
with wpa_supplicant, because restarting it fixes it. On Ubuntu distributions, this problem
does not occur, so they have a fix for it. See this Ubuntu bug report for more information:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-nettool/+bug/1311257 .

= Kernel =
{{Kernel||

= Required packages =
