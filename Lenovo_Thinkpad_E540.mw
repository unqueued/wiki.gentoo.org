= Issues =
* If the device has an UEFI Firmware version >1.61 it will not resume from suspend
(see [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1331077 this link] for
more information). There is a workaround for this problem (see section Workarounds).
* After resume from suspend, the Wifi will not connect again.

* Sometimes, when the device resumes from suspend, the power LED will blink.
There is a workaround for this problem (see section Workarounds).
* Sometimes, when the device resumes from suspend, the hotkeys are no longer
working

= Workarounds =
== No Wifi after resume ==
When the device resumes from suspend, the Wifi will no longer work. This seems to be a problem
with wpa_supplicant, because restarting it fixes it. On Ubuntu distributions, this problem
does not occur, so they have a fix for it. See this Ubuntu bug report for more information:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-nettool/+bug/1311257 .

== No resume possible (UEFI problem) ==
When you open the lid or press a button to resume, the device will not resume. The fan seems
to come on, but thats it. You have to hard reset (push the power button for about 5 seconds)
to make it work again.
To make resume work, you have to turn off "USB 3 Mode" in the UEFI settings
(pushing Enter when the laptop starts). The drawback of this method is, of course, that your
USB ports will only work in USB 2 mode, which means much slower data transfers.

== Blinking power LED after resume ==
Sometimes, when the device resumes, the power LED will blink instead of stay lit. This can be fixed by
resetting the power LED after suspend. To do this, you have to issue the following command as root:
{{RootCmd|echo '0 on' > /proc/acpi/ibm/led|output=<pre></pre>}}
See "Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt" in your kernel source directory for more information.

If you are using Xfce4, you can install this package to see the status of your modifier keys (Caps-Lock,Num-Lock):
* xfce-extra/xfce4-kbdleds-plugin
