When using <code>emerge</code> for building a package, it is not uncommon to notice messages coming from Portage itself. Since they may contain important informations from Gentoo developers it's a good idea to read them, but often this is not immediately possible because they rapidly scroll out of the screen. This can be easily solved if you enable a Portage feature called '''elog'', whose purpose is to save messages to disk for a later review.
