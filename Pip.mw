{{Emerge|dev-python/pip}}

== Usage ==

In order for {{c|pip}} to operate correctly when installing new packages an active internet connection is a requirement.

{{Important|It is important to understand that packages installed using {{c|pip}} will not be tracked by Portage. This is the case for installing any package through means other than the {{c|emerge}} command. Possible conflicts can be created when installing a Python package that is available in the Portage tree, then installing the same package using {{c|pip}}.
<br>
Decide which package manager will work best for the use case: either use {{c|emerge}} ''or'' {{c|pip}} for Python packages, but not both. Sometimes a certain Python packages will not be available in the Portage tree, in these cases the only option is to use {{c|pip}}. Be wise and make good choices!}}
