=== Package installation ===

{{Warning|Running {{c|pip}} as root is not advised. It can render important system tools like {{c|emerge}} useless.<ref>https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1006016.html</ref>}}

{{Important|It is important to understand that packages installed using {{c|pip}} will not be tracked by Portage. This is the case for installing any package through means other than the {{c|emerge}} command. Possible conflicts can be created when installing a Python package that is available in the Portage tree, then installing the same package using {{c|pip}}.
<br>
Decide which package manager will work best for the use case: either use {{c|emerge}} ''or'' {{c|pip}} for Python packages, but not both. Some Python packages are not available in the Portage tree, in these cases the only option is to use {{c|pip}}. One possibility is to use the <code>--user</code> option to install Python packages in a user's home directory. This will avoid conflicts with Portage. Be wise and make good choices!}}

To install a package using the {{c|pip}} command, where <code>package</code> is the desired package:

{{Cmd|pip install <package>}}

To install the package in a user's home directory, be signed-in as the desired user, then issue:

{{Cmd|pip install --user <package>}}

This will install the package in the user's {{Path|~/.local/}} directory.

== Removal ==

To remove a package using {{c|pip}}:

{{Cmd|pip uninstall <package>}}
