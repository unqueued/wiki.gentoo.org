|Puppet Portage module|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Puppet is a tool for configuration management, in other words maintaining Gentoo by defining infrastructure as code rather than manually editing config files. This is extremely powerful for scaling servers up, and it greatly increases the efficiency of sysadmins. The [https://github.com/adrienthebo/puppet-portage Puppet Portage module] supports a bunch of Portage specific operations (more info can be found in its README file). There are lots of issues and feature requests needed, that can be found in its issue tracker in Github that should be implemented.
