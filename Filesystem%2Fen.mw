=== Disk filesystems ===

* [[ext4]] - The default, GPL licensed journaling filesystem for many Linux distributions.
* [[JFS]] - A GPL licensed, 64-bit journaling filesystem developed by IBM.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFS_file_system</ref>
* [[Btrfs]] - A copy-on-write B-tree filesystem with advanced features.
* [[NTFS]] - Microsoft Windows default filesystem.
* [[Aufs]]
* [[OverlayFS]]
* [[SquashFS]] - A compressed read-only file system for Linux<ref>[[wikipedia:SquashFS]]</ref>
* [[XFS]] - A GPL licensed, 64-bit journaling filesystem created by Silicon Graphics.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS</ref>
* [[ZFS]] - A CDDL (non-GPL compatible) licensed, copy-on-write filesystem created by Sun Microsystems.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS</ref>

=== Virtual filesystems ===

* [[procfs]] - Used to output and change of system and process information.
* [[sysfs]] - Used to output information about and to configure devices and drivers.
* [[tmpfs]] - Used to store files in memory (RAM).
* devtmpfs - {{c|udev}} requires [[Udev#Kernel|devtmpfs]] (Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev) in the kernel.

=== Network filesystems ===

* [[Ceph]] - A distributed object store and filesystem designed to provide excellent performance, reliability and scalability.
* [[NFS]] - A common Linux network file system protocol.
* [[SSHFS]] - Implements FUSE to mount filesystems in user space. 
* [[TahoeLAFS]] - A least authority file system.

== Mounting ==

Filesystems can be mounted in several ways:

* {{c|[[mount]]}} - The command used to manually mount filesystems. Requires administrative privileges or entries in {{Path|/etc/fstab}}. 
* [[fstab|{{Path|/etc/fstab}}]] - Contains descriptive information about the filesystems the system can mount.
* [[Removable media]] - Mount on file demand.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on file access.
