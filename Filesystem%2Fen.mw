A ''filesystem'' is [[Article description::a means to organize data expected to be retained after a program terminates by providing procedures to store, retrieve, and update data as well as manage the available space on the device(s) which contain it.]]

Linux has a few dozen filesystems available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages when considering a particular use case.

== Filesystems ==

=== General information ===

* [[Filesystem/Access Control List Guide|Access Control List Guide]]
* [[Filesystem/Security|Filesystem Security]]

=== Disk filesystems ===

* [[bcachefs]] - A next generation, robust, high performance filesystem supporting CoW (Copy-on-write), compression, and encryption.
* [[eCryptfs]] - The enterprise cryptographic filesystem for Linux.
* [[ext4]] - The default, GPL licensed journaling filesystem for many Linux distributions.
* [[FAT]] - The File Allocation Table (FAT) filesystem. Originally created for use with Microsoft Windows.
* [[JFS]] - A GPL licensed, 64-bit Journaled File System (JFS) developed by IBM.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFS_file_system</ref>
* [[Btrfs]] - A copy-on-write B-tree file system (Btrfs) with advanced features (an entirely open source licensed ZFS alternative).
* [[NTFS]] - Microsoft Windows' New Technology File System (NTFS) (Windows' default filesystem).
* [[Aufs]] - Advanced multi-layered unification file system (Aufs), formerally known as Another union file system.
* [[OverlayFS]] - The only union-like filesystem built-in to the Linux kernel.
* [[wikipedia:ReiserFS|ReiserFS]] - Version 3 of the ReiserFS filesystem.
* [https://reiser4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page Reiser4] - Version 4 of ReiserFS filesystem. Currently not implemented in the mainline Linux kernel.
* [[SquashFS]] - A compressed, read-only file system for Linux<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS</ref>
* [[wikipedia:Universal Disk Format|UDF]] - Universal Disk Format - needed for mounting some kind of .iso files
* [[wikipedia:Unix_File_System|UFS]] - The Unix File System (UFS) also called the Berkeley Fast File System.
* [[XFS]] - A GPL licensed, 64-bit journaling filesystem created by Silicon Graphics.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS</ref>
* [[ZFS]] - A CDDL (non-GPL compatible) licensed, copy-on-write filesystem created by Sun Microsystems.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS</ref>
* [[F2FS]] - A Flash-Friendly File System (F2FS) created by Samsung for the Linux kernel.

=== Virtual filesystems ===

* [[wikipedia:Debugfs|debugfs]] - Used for debugging purposes; primarily Linux kernel development.
* [[procfs]] - Used to output and change of system and process information.
* [[securityfs]] - Used by the TPM bios character driver and IMA, an integrity provider.<ref>https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/tree/security/Kconfig</ref>
* [[sysfs]] - Used to output information about and to configure devices and drivers.
* [[tmpfs]] - Used to store files in memory (RAM).
* devtmpfs - {{c|udev}} requires [[Udev#Kernel|devtmpfs]] (Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at {{Path|[[:/dev]]}}) in the kernel.

=== Network filesystems ===

* [[Ceph]] - A distributed object store and filesystem designed to provide excellent performance, reliability, and scalability.
* [[NFS]] - A common Linux network file system protocol.
* [[SSHFS]] - Implements FUSE to mount filesystems in user space. 
* [[Tahoe-LAFS]] - A Least Authority File Store (LAFS).
* [[wikipedia:GlusterFS|GlusterFS]] - A powerful network/cluster filesystem.

=== FUSE-based filesystems ===

* [[CurlFtpFS]] - File system for accessing ftp hosts based on FUSE.
* [[exFAT]] - A FUSE filesystem for the extended FAT filesystem.
* [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-fs/fuseiso FuseISO] - FUSE module to mount ISO filesystem images.
* [[MTP#MTPfs|MTPfs]] - A FUSE filesystem providing access to Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) devices.
* [[smbnetfs]] - A FUSE filesystem for SMB shares.
* [https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-fs/squashfuse squashfuse] - Mount SquashFS archives using FUSE.

== Usage ==

=== Mounting ===

Filesystems can be mounted in several ways:

* {{c|[[mount]]}} - The command used to manually mount filesystems. Requires administrative privileges or entries in {{Path|/etc/fstab}}. 
* [[fstab|{{Path|/etc/fstab}}]] - Contains descriptive information about the filesystems the system can mount.
* [[Removable media]] - Mount on file demand.
* [[Udevil]] - A small auto-mount utility with little dependencies.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on file access.

== See also ==

* [[bcache]] - A Linux kernel block layer cache.
* [[Filesystem_in_Userspace|FUSE]] - File system in User Space (FUSE).
