This article describes the configuration of a Bluetooth [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headset_(audio) headset].

== Prerequisites ==

This article assumes that [[Bluetooth]] and [[ALSA]] have been previously configured.

== Configuration ==

=== PulseAudio ===

Following instructions from [[PulseAudio]] and [[Bluetooth#BlueZ_5|BlueZ 5]] should be sufficient to make Bluetooth headsets work (through ''pavucontrol'' for instance).

=== ALSA + Bluez 5 ===

If you do not want to use PulseAudio, you can use [https://github.com/Arkq/bluez-alsa bluez-alsa] to provide integration between Bluez and ALSA.

* Make sure you have emerged Bluez 5, not Bluez 4
  {{Cmd|equery list net-wireless/bluez}}
* Install bluez-alsa:
  {{Emerge|media-sound/bluez-alsa}}
* In your ALSA configuration, {{Path|/etc/asound.conf}} (system-wide) or {{Path|~/.asoundrc}} (user-level), specify the parameters of the Bluetooth connection (replace the MAC address with the MAC address of your device)
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc|1=
# Bluetooth headset
defaults.bluealsa {
     interface "hci0"            # host Bluetooth adapter
     device "10:4F:A8:00:11:22"  # Bluetooth headset MAC address
     profile "a2dp"
}
}}
A static ALSA configuration is also possible, make sure to change the device name in the below examples for aplay.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc|1=
# Bluetooth headset
pcm.btheadset {
        type plug
        slave.pcm {
                type bluealsa
                device "10:4F:A8:00:11:22"
                profile "a2dp"
        }
        hint {
                show on
                description "Your description of Bluetooth Headset"
        }
}}

* Make sure the ''bluetooth'' and ''bluealsa'' services are started. You probably want to add them to your default runlevel via ''rc-config''.
* Make sure the device is paired and connected to your computer. See [[Bluetooth]] for details.
* Test with e.g. aplay, passing the PCM device 'bluealsa'
{{Cmd|aplay -D bluealsa some_file.wav}}
* For other applications, the precise option to set the output device may differ.

{{Note|Changes to ALSA configuration files {{Path|/etc/asound.conf}} and {{Path|~/.asoundrc}} are picked up automatically at application start, you don't need to restart the ''alsasound'' service.}}

* Hardware volume control:
  {{Cmd|alsamixer -D bluealsa}}

=== ALSA + Bluez 4 ===

If for some reason, you do not want to PulseAudio nor ALSA + Bluez 5 using bluez-alsa as described above, then you could try the following method.

* Make sure you have emerged Bluez 4, not Bluez 5
  {{Cmd|equery list net-wireless/bluez}}
  You will probably need to mask Bluez 5 and then re-emerge bluez.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.mask|1=
>=net-wireless/bluez-5
}}

* Add one of the following code snippets to {{Path|/etc/asound.conf}} (system-wide) or {{Path|~/.asoundrc}} (user-level), and substitute the MAC address with the MAC address of your Bluetooth device.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc|1=
# First try autodetection:
@hooks [
	{
		func load
		files [
			"/usr/share/alsa/bluetooth.conf"
		]
		errors false
	}
]

# Specify your device if autodetection doesn't work for you:

## To redirect ALL output to the headset
#pcm.!default {
#type bluetooth
#device 00:16:44:FD:6B:A0
#profile "auto"
#}

## OR: to create a new, additional output channel
#pcm.bluetooth {
#type bluetooth
#device 00:16:44:FD:6B:A0
#profile "auto"
#}
}}

* Restart ALSA.
'''OpenRC'''
{{RootCmd|rc-service alsasound restart}}
'''systemd'''
{{RootCmd|systemctl restart alsasound}}

== Testing ==

* Play a sound file.
{{Cmd|mplayer -ao alsa:device{{=}}bluetooth ''filename''}}
If it works, please add your device to the table of [[#Working_devices|working]] devices.

== Working devices ==

{{Note|The capabilities of the device are dependent on the Bluetooth controller being used.}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Audio socket (Bluez 4 only) ===

The ''ALSA + Bluez 4'' setup needs ''Socket'' enabled, if there's no sound.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf|1=
[General]
Enable=Socket
}}

=== Can't open input device ===

Compile and load the ''uinput'' kernel module, when things don't work, and the logs show this error:
{{CodeBox|1=
bluetoothd: Can't open input device: No such file or directory (2)
bluetoothd: AVRCP: failed to init uinput for 00:16:44:FD:6B:A0
bluetoothd: Unable to select SEP
}}

{{KernelBox|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
   Input device support  --->
      [*]   Miscellaneous devices  --->
         <M>   User level driver support
</pre>}}

=== No audio service is available ===

After updating to {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}}-5.xx it might happen, that a Bluetooth headset is connected, but [[ALSA]] / [[PulseAudio]] fails to pick up the connected device.

An error message like this might be shown in the output of PulseAudio:
{{CodeBox|1=
I: [pulseaudio] module-card-restore.c: Restoring profile for card bluez_card.00_16_94_0B_6F_DE.
I: [pulseaudio] card.c: Created 10 "bluez_card.00_16_94_0B_6F_DE"
bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)
W: [pulseaudio] module-bluetooth-device.c: Bluetooth audio service not available
W: [pulseaudio] module-bluetooth-device.c: Service not connected
I: [pulseaudio] card.c: Freed 10 "bluez_card.00_16_94_0B_6F_DE"
E: [pulseaudio] module.c: Failed to load module "module-bluetooth-device" (argument: "address="00:16:94:0B:6F:DE" path="/org/bluez/31716/hci0/dev_00_16_94_0B_6F_DE""): initialization failed.
}}

To fix this, the following needs to be done:
# Enable the audio socket of bluetoothd
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf|1=
[General]
Enable=Socket
}}
# Restart ''bluetoothd'' by doing one of the following things:
#* Turn the software wireless kill switch off and on again
{{RootCmd|rfkill block bluetooth
|rfkill unblock bluetooth}}
#* Turn the hardware wireless kill switch off and on again
#* Reboot the computer
# Reconnect the Bluetooth headset
