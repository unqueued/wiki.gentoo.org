Providing a split boost ebuilds will allow us to refine package dependencies and allow users to build and install only necessary parts of boost, effectively reducing build time and disk use.

== Description ==
Currently, boost in Gentoo is installed as a single {{Package|dev-libs/boost}}. This single package builds and installs all Boost libraries, in single- and multi-threaded variant. Additionally, if ''USE=static-libs'' is enabled static variants of all the libraries are built. This results in long compile times and high disk space use.

For an example, shared build of boost on 2x1.6 GHz Pentium takes nearly one hour, and the installed files occupy 420 MiB. This may make boost unsuitable to be used on embedded systems, for example.

Our intent is to split boost into smaller packages which could be built and installed independently. This way, users could avoid building and installing those parts of boost which they don't need, effectively reducing the disk space occupied and decreasing the build time (as long as not all components will be built).
