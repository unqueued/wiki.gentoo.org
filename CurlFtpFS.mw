FTPFS allows one to mount the FTP folder as a regular directory to the local directory tree.

== Installation ==

First of all, it is necessary to enable the FUSE option support in kernel configuration:
  File systems --->
    <M> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support 

It is also necessary to install the ''net-fs/curlftpfs'' package.

  emerge -va net-fs/curlftpfs

== Usage ==


=== As a regular user ===

First, create a mount point:
  mkdir ./ftp

==== Mounting ====

Then mount the necessary ''catalog'' from the ''server'' to this mount point: 
  curlftpfs ftp://server/catalog/ ./ftp/ -o user=username:password,utf8

==== Unmounting ====

  fusermount -u ./ftp

== As root ==

=== One-time mount ===

=== /etc/fstab ===
