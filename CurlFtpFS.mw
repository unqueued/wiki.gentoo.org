FTPFS allows one to mount the FTP folder as a regular directory to the local directory tree.

= Installation =

In order to use this method, it is necessary to have the FUSE support on the system and install the net-fs/curlftpfs package.

  emerge -va net-fs/curlftpfs

= Mounting =

== As a regular user ==

First, create a mount point:
  mkdir ./ftp

Then mount the necessary ''catalog'' from the ''server'' to this mount point: 
  curlftpfs ftp://server/catalog/ ./ftp/ -o user=username:password,utf8

== As root ==
