Overlayfs ('''Overlay''' '''F'''ile'''s'''ystem) differs from other "union filesystem" implementations in that after a file is opened all operations go directly to the underlying, lower or upper, filesystems.  This simplifies the implementation and allows native performance in these cases.<ref>https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e9be9d5e76e34872f0c37d72e25bc27fe9e2c54c</ref>

OverlayFS exists in Linux kernels 3.18.0 and higher.
