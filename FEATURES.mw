'''The <code>FEATURES</code> variable contains a list of Portage features that the user wants enabled on the system, effectively setting Portage behavior.'''

The <code>FEATURES</code> variable is by default already set by the users' [[profile]], but can be updated through {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}

For more information, please see [[Handbook:AMD64/Working/Features|Portage Features]] in the Gentoo Handbook.
