'''The <code>FEATURES</code> variable contains a list of Portage features that the user wants enabled on the system, effectively setting Portage behavior.'''

The <code>FEATURES</code> variable is by default already set by the users' [[profile]], but can be updated through {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. Since this is an incremental variable, you can add directly your feature without overriding the profile ones.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Adding keepwork to portage|lang=bash|1=
 FEATURES="keepwork"
}}

For more information, please see [[Handbook:AMD64/Working/Features|Portage Features]] in the Gentoo Handbook.
