* [http://www.freetechbooks.com/the-selinux-notebook-the-foundations-t785.html SELinux Notebook - The Foundations], an ''excellent'' resource for SELinux policy language and constructs (do not consider the date at the beginning, the book is often updated which can be seen through the comments below)
