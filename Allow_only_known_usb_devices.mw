In this article I'll describe how to protect your GNU/Linux box against alien USB devices. So we configure GNU/Linux to accept only known USB devices.

=Kernel protection=

In kernel "sys-kernel/hardened-sources" we have two options for Physical Protections:

{{KernelBox|title=make menuconfig options|<pre>
Security options  --->
    Grsecurity  --->
        [*] Grsecurity
            Customize Configuration  --->
                Physical Protections  --->
                    [*] Deny new USB connections after toggle
                    [ ]   Reject all USB devices not connected at boot


GRKERNSEC_DENYUSB
Related sysctl variables:

    kernel.grsecurity.deny_new_usb

If you say Y here, a new sysctl option with name "deny_new_usb"
will be created.  Setting its value to 1 will prevent any new
USB devices from being recognized by the OS.  Any attempted USB
device insertion will be logged.  This option is intended to be
used against custom USB devices designed to exploit vulnerabilities
in various USB device drivers.

For greatest effectiveness, this sysctl should be set after any
relevant init scripts.  This option is safe to enable in distros
as each user can choose whether or not to toggle the sysctl.


GRKERNSEC_DENYUSB_FORCE

If you say Y here, a variant of GRKERNSEC_DENYUSB will be enabled
that doesn't involve a sysctl entry.  This option should only be
enabled if you're sure you want to deny all new USB connections
at runtime and don't want to modify init scripts.  This should not
be enabled by distros.  It forces the core USB code to be built
into the kernel image so that all devices connected at boot time
can be recognized and new USB device connections can be prevented
prior to init running.

It is very good choice for servers in datacenter and server's rooms. But at reboot it is still vulnerable! Also it does not give the flexibility needed on workstations when we want to connect USB devices during run time. So let's write ''eudev'' rules to allow only known USB devices in the system.

=eudev=

'''''eudev''''' allows us to create rules to configure devices as they are added or removed from a system, in our case we will allow and disallow USB devices based on their identifying strings.

==Retrieve information about our USB devices==

The first thing that needs to be done is to collect identifying strings that can be used to white list our USB devices.

===lsusb===

How to obtain more information about connected USB devices? Install package ''usbutils'':
{{Emerge|sys-apps/usbutils}}
and run:
{{RootCmd|lsusb|output=<pre>
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 4444:4444 Example, USB Keyboard
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 3333:3333 Example, USB Optical Mouse
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 5555:5555 USB Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 2222:2222 Example, USB Optical Mouse
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
</pre>}}
We can see ''USB Optical Mouse'' connected on bus 3 and listed as device 2. We will first need to find this device’s port number. To figure out port numbers run ''lsusb'' with option ''-t'':
{{RootCmd|lsusb –t|output=<pre>
/:  Bus 05.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=uhci_hcd/2p, 12M
/:  Bus 04.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=uhci_hcd/2p, 12M
/:  Bus 03.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=uhci_hcd/2p, 12M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
/:  Bus 02.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=uhci_hcd/2p, 12M
/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=ehci-pci/8p, 480M
    |__ Port 4: Dev 3, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/8p, 480M
        |__ Port 1: Dev 4, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
        |__ Port 5: Dev 5, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
        |__ Port 5: Dev 5, If 1, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
</pre>}}
Now we can see that ''USB Optical Mouse'' connected on bus 3 and listed as device 2 really connected at '''port 1 of USB bus 3'''!
Also ''lsusb'' with option ''-v'' expand verbose output, but the format is not convenient for copying and pasting into eudev rules.

===Sysfs===

Information about attached USB devices can be obtained through Sysfs:
{{RootCmd|ls /sys/bus/usb/devices/|output=<pre>
1-0:1.0  1-4  1-4.1  1-4:1.0  1-4.1:1.0  1-4.5  1-4.5:1.0  1-4.5:1.1  2-0:1.0  3-0:1.0  3-1  3-1:1.0  4-0:1.0  5-0:1.0  usb1  usb2  usb3  usb4  usb5
</pre>}}
The subdirectories we are interested in are in the format '''''bus_number-port''''' or '''''bus_number-port.port'''''. The second one is in case hubs are used, then port section of the directory name may be a series of port numbers separated by periods. So pay attention only to follow dirs:
{{RootCmd|input=<pre>ls /sys/bus/usb/devices/ |grep -v ':'</pre>|output=<pre>
1-4  1-4.1  1-4.5  3-1  usb1  usb2  usb3  usb4  usb5
</pre>}}
'''''usb1  usb2  usb3  usb4  usb5''''' is a Linux root hub, don't forgot add rules for them!!!

Sysfs is a virtual file system that gives information and allows the control of devices which the kernel exports. There is one specific setting: '''''authorized'''''. All USB devices should have an '''''authorized''''' option which controls whether or not the device can communicate with the system.
For example, if we wished to see if the device in port 1 of the 3 USB bus is active we could use the following command:
{{RootCmd|cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-1/authorized|output=<pre>
1
</pre>}}
The 1 in the output tells us the device is authorized, 0 would mean not authorized. So we can allow USB devices by running:
{{RootCmd|echo "1" /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-1/authorized}}
And disallow:
{{RootCmd|echo "0" > /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-1/authorized}}
But it is not convenient too.

===udevadm===

To retrieve information like the serial number, vendor and product ID and manufacturer’s name of our device connected to ''port 1 on 3 USB bus'', you can run the following command:
{{RootCmd|udevadm info -a -p /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-1|output=<pre>

Udevadm info starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
walks up the chain of parent devices. For every device
found it prints all possible attributes in the udev rules key format.
A rule to match, can be composed of the attributes of the device
and the attributes from one single parent device.

  looking at device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.1/usb3/3-1':
    KERNEL=="3-1"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb"
.................................."
    ATTR{idVendor}=="2222"
..................................
    ATTR{configuration}=="HID-compliant MOUSE"
..................................
    ATTR{authorized}=="1"
..................................
    ATTR{manufacturer}=="Example"
..................................
    ATTR{idProduct}=="2222"
    ATTR{bDeviceClass}=="00"
    ATTR{product}=="USB Optical Mouse"
..................................
</pre>}}
All of these "ATTR" attributes can be used in our eudev rules. You need to add rules to ''/lib/udev/rules.d/'' that will whitelist only the given devices, and blacklist all the rest.

==Writing eudev rules==

Now we can start writing ''eudev'' rules to enable/disable USB devices. Create a file with rules in ''/lib/udev/rules.d/01-usb.rules'' to ensure that it is running in the beginning.
Pay attention to add all USB hubs at the start of your rules. All USB hubs have ''ATTR{bDeviceClass}=="09"''. Also we add more information: ''ATTR{manufacturer}'' and ''ATTR{product}'' for human readable descriptions.

To authorize the device set ''ATTR{authorized}="1"'', to block it, set ''ATTR{authorized}="0"''

Some multifunction modern devices like smartphones, ebook, and so on has many operation modes. It can operate as '''USB storage device, USB camera, USB modem, USB network device''', ... So when we write rule for such devices we must add one rule for each operation modes!
Reattach device, switch different operation modes and see deference in output:
{{RootCmd|udevadm info -a -p /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-1|output=<pre>

Udevadm info starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
walks up the chain of parent devices. For every device
found it prints all possible attributes in the udev rules key format.
A rule to match, can be composed of the attributes of the device
and the attributes from one single parent device.

  looking at device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.1/usb3/3-1':
    KERNEL=="3-1"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb"
..................................
    ATTR{serial}=="00000000001"
..................................
    ATTR{idProduct}=="000a"
..................................
</pre>}}
It can change his serial number or ATTR{idProduct}=="000a" attribute! So '''eudev''' rules for such device look like:
{{FileBox|filename=/lib/udev/rules.d/01-usb.rules|title=eudev rules for enable only known Smartphone|<pre>
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{manufacturer}=="Example", ATTR{product}=="Smartphone", ATTR{serial}=="000000000", \
  ATTR{idVendor}=="0000", ATTR{idProduct}=="000a", ATTR{authorized}="1", GOTO="usb_end"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{manufacturer}=="Example", ATTR{product}=="Smartphone", ATTR{serial}=="000000000", \
  ATTR{idVendor}=="0000", ATTR{idProduct}=="000b", ATTR{authorized}="1", GOTO="usb_end"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{manufacturer}=="Example", ATTR{product}=="Smartphone", ATTR{serial}=="000000000", \
  ATTR{idVendor}=="0000", ATTR{idProduct}=="000c", ATTR{authorized}="1", GOTO="usb_end"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{manufacturer}=="Example", ATTR{product}=="Smartphone", ATTR{serial}=="000000000", \
  ATTR{idVendor}=="0000", ATTR{idProduct}=="000d", ATTR{authorized}="1", GOTO="usb_end"
</pre>}}
Or
{{FileBox|filename=/lib/udev/rules.d/01-usb.rules|title=eudev rules for enable only known E-Book|<pre>
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{manufacturer}=="Example", ATTR{product}=="E-Book", ATTR{serial}=="000000001", \
  ATTR{idVendor}=="0000", ATTR{idProduct}=="0000", ATTR{authorized}="1", GOTO="usb_end"

</pre>}}

==Test eudev rules==

To test your script run the following command:
{{RootCmd|udevadm test /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-1}}
It will not actually apply the changes, it only shows which conditional statements are applied when a certain device is inserted.
