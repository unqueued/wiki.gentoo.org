== Best practices ==

* '''Reread the text before submission''', the text cannot be edited afterwards. Also any text entered into a bug report will be usually e-mailed immediately to many people. Write in precise and clean language and avoid colloquial speech.  '''Hint:''' Imagine you have '''only one chance in your life''' to write this very important bug report. You know that the recipient can read English, but it is not his native language.

* '''Search for duplicates''', before creating a new bug. 

* '''Stay on topic''' - A bug ticket is used for technical reports and chitchat should be avoided. Keep them in the [https://www.gentoo.org/support/ support channels] (forums, IRC or mailing lists). 
* '''Confirm the existence of a problem only once.''' - It does not help solving the problem, if you and another person report it twice. But if your and the confirmer's systems differ in an obvious way and that would be helpful to know, add this information. 
* '''Open one bug ticket per topic''' - Usually this means not more than one package and one bug per ticket. If your problem is not discussed on a bug, search for one related to your issue or create a new report. Do not hijack bugs.
* '''No talk on TRACKER bugs.''' - Those bugs are meta bugs. If you want to add useful information, add them to a related sub bug or create a new bug.
* Optional: [[Foundation:Consultants|Gentoo consultants]] provide also '''commercial support''' for bugs and ebuilds.
* [[Attach the logs to the bug ticket]] if the ticket is about problems during runtime or installation.

== Packages/ebuild ==

Si dovrebbero sempre aggiungere le informazioni sulla configurazione del sistema per la segnalazione di un bug. Per fare questo, creare un nuovo attachment e incollare il contenuto di:

{{Cmd|emerge --info > /tmp/emerge--info.txt}}

=== Report a build-time bug (emerge failed) ===

[[File:Bugzilla screenshot summary-keyword.png|thumbnail|Use the '''Add an attachment''' button below the description text box in order to attach files in bugzilla.]]
* First write the exact version of the package in the title of the bug report e.g. ''sys-apps/package-2.3-r4''
* Add a short description to the title.
* '''[[Attach the logs to the bug ticket]]'''

=== Report a run-time bug ===


I file e le informazioni di interesse in ordine di priorità:

* The exact version of the package in the title of the bug report e.g. ''sys-apps/package-2.3-r4 crashes with error: Cannot proceed...''
* Description of the problem, so that other can reproduce it:
** How is the program run (on the console, in a terminal, as a daemon, in what runlevel etc.)
** Any error output
** What makes the program crash, behave wrong, not start
** Is there a workaround?
** What was the last working version of the package, if any?
** What changed to make it not work?
* '''[[Attach the logs to the bug ticket]]'''

=== Report a version bump; a newer upstream release is available since a while ===

* Search Bugzilla before posting a bump request - is there already a bug open? '''Has the local Portage tree been synced lately'''; is it already in Portage? 
* Avoid [[zero-day bump requests]] (wait at least '''48 hours''' after the release announcement)
* Has it actually been '''released''' by upstream sources, '''or is it just marked''' in the source tree? Some projects mark a release in the tree long time before it is officially released.
* Be sure to '''mention if it compiles and runs well on your arch'''. Any other helpful information you provide is most welcome.
* Add a link to the upstream website
* Give a link or list of fixed bugs or new features (sometimes called '''changelog''')
* Write a '''summary''' in the form ''app-editors/vim-12.3.5 version bump''

==== Optional ====

* Does a simple copy work, or does the ebuild need changes? (changed dependencies, obsolete patch files)
* [[Package testing|Test the ebuild]] in a local overlay before submitting attachments
* Provide patches for proposed ebuild edits, with optional explanation of changes (file name should match the new version number, not old)
* Provide additional files (initd, unit files) as separate attachments (as needed)
* Do not paste files directly into comments; [[Attach the logs to the bug ticket|use attachments.]]

=== Request for a new package; ebuild request ===

Se si richiede una nuova ebuild per un software da aggiungere a Portage, è necessario trovare o diventare un manutentore per il pacchetto:

* Link to the upstream website in the bug report
* Give a link or list of features
* Suggest a preliminary category and package name for the ebuild in the subject line for example ''media-gfx/inkscape ebuild request''
* [[Github Pull Requests|Provide an ebuild]] and patches that were tested in your [[Handbook:Parts/Portage/CustomTree#Defining_a_custom_repository|local overlay]] (you can get help in [https://www.gentoo.org/support/ IRC or in the forums] with that)

Pacchetto XY deve essere contrassegnato stabile

Un pacchetto è costruito e ha lavorato senza problemi nel sistema per più di 30 giorni, ma è ancora contrassegnato come instabile:

== Kernel ==

File e informazioni di interesse per i rapporti di bug relativi al kernel in ordine di priorità:

* Quale kernel e relativa versione vengono utilizzati e su quale architettura; ad esempio ''gentoo-sources-3.4.2-r2'' on ''x86_64''
* Il file di configurazione del kernel deve essere allegato al bug report {{Path|/usr/src/linux/.config}}
* Un elenco di tutti i dispositivi del sistema può essere acquisita con ''lspci -k''
* I files di log durante l'inizializzazione del kernel devono essere allegati {{Path|/var/log/dmesg}} or {{Path|/var/log/messages}}

{{Nota | Su richiesta, un [[kernel git-bisect]] potrebbe essere fatto per identificare le patch difettose}}
