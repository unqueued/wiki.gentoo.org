[[S6]] is a supervision suite like [[Runit]], [[Daemontools]] and [[Daemontools-encore]]. [[S6]] is very similar to [[Runit]] on its design which can be used to bypass SysVinit [[Comparison of init systems|init]] and [[OpenRC]] altogether. However, the command line utilities are named after daemontools with ''s6-'' prefix. Morever, [[S6]] comes with a [[shell]] like interpreted language&mdash;execline&mdash; to facilitate init/PID 1 migration, that is, stage 1&mdash;system ''initialization''&mdash; and stage 3&mdash;system ''halt''. (Init) Stage 1 should exec into stage 2&mdash;system ''normal'' functionning state&mdash; to give ''s6-svscan'' (process supervisor utility) the wheel of the system.

== Installation ==

== Configuration ==

=== Supervision ===

See [[Runit]] article for more information because every step described in that article apply here, minor an init (PID 1) replacement.
PID 1 is left as an implementation choice (to distribution and/or Operating System), that is, no ''init'' is offered&mdash;writting one is necessary!
Of course, using the power and flexibility of [[OpenRC]] is an option... See [[Runit]] article.

=== Init Stage 3 ===

[[S6]]'s Stage 3 is quite different from [[Runit]]'s satege 3. Special care should be taken here!
The stage 3 is divided into ''.s6-svscan/crash'' and and ''.s6-svscan/finish'' scripts&mdash;the first for ''s6-svscan'' crash and the latter for extra steps that should dealt when terminating ''s6-svscan (system ''halt'' included if used as PID 1.)
And ''.s6-svscan'' should be present in ''/service/'' directory or... the directory would be created without any safety net (crash/finish cases.)
