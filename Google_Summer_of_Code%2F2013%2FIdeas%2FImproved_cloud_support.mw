|Improved cloud support|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Gentoo has a great opportunity to be amazing for use in public clouds like Amazon's AWS platform. For this to work well, we will need to integrate cloud support much more thoroughly into our release-engineering processes. For examples, [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/catalyst/ catalyst] and related [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/ releng] tools should produce and upload images to AWS, in addition to supporting tools like [http://www.vagrantup.com/ Vagrant] with pregenerated boxes (perhaps using [https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee veewee]).

This could be supplemented by improving Gentoo's support for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps DevOps]-style workflows. For example, we should make it extremely easy to set up [http://dberkholz.com/2013/03/14/opportunities-for-gentoo/ modern monitoring tools] like Graphite, to push development from local boxes to the cloud, to integrate with continuous integration testing tools like [http://jenkins-ci.org/ Jenkins] or [https://travis-ci.org/ Travis], and more.
