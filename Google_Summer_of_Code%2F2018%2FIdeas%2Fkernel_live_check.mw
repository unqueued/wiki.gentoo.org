<!-- Description goes here: --> 
The [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Aliceinwire/Kernel_CI Gentoo Kernel CI] is starting to automatize part of the Gentoo kernel releasing process, this is making more fast Gentoo Kernel release possible. Having a working Gentoo Kernel CI is critical for keeping up with the new upstream Kernel release style, but probably more important would give the possibility of fast stabilizing a kernel, with adequate architecture disposable. The task would be to improve the current Gentoo Kernel CI and designing and creating new feature.|
