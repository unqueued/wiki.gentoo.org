Pluggable authentication modules.

PAM is a suite of shared libraries that provide an alternative way providing user authentication in programs. The <code>pam</code> USE flag is turned on by default. Thus the PAM settings on Gentoo Linux are pretty reasonable, but there is always room for improvement. First install {{Package|sys-libs/cracklib}}:

{{Emerge|sys-libs/cracklib}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/pam.d/passwd|1=
auth     required pam_unix.so shadow nullok
account  required pam_unix.so
password required pam_cracklib.so difok=3 retry=3 minlen=8 dcredit=-2 ocredit=-2
password required pam_unix.so md5 use_authtok
session  required pam_unix.so
}}

This will add the cracklib which will ensure that the user passwords are at least 8 characters and contain a minimum of 2 digits, 2 other characters, and are more than 3 characters different from the last password. This forces the user to choose a good password (password policy). Check the PAM [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_cracklib.8.html cracklib documentation] for more options.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/pam.d/sshd|1=
auth     required pam_unix.so nullok
auth     required pam_shells.so
auth     required pam_nologin.so
auth     required pam_env.so
account  required pam_unix.so
password required pam_cracklib.so difok=3 retry=3 minlen=8 dcredit=-2 ocredit=-2 use_authtok
password required pam_unix.so shadow md5
session  required pam_unix.so
session  required pam_limits.so
}}

Every service not configured with a PAM file in {{Path|/etc/pam.d}} will use the rules in {{Path|/etc/pam.d/other}}. The defaults are set to deny, as they should be. But I like to have a lot of logs, which is why I added {{Path|pam_warn.so}}. The last configuration is pam_limits, which is controlled by {{Path|/etc/security/limits.conf}}. See the {{Path|[[Security_Handbook/User/Group_limitations#.2Fetc.2Fsecurity.2Flimits.conf|/etc/security/limits.conf]]}} section for more on these settings.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/pam.d/other|1=
auth     required pam_deny.so
auth     required pam_warn.so
account  required pam_deny.so
account  required pam_warn.so
password required pam_deny.so
password required pam_warn.so
session  required pam_deny.so
session  required pam_warn.so
}}
