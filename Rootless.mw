== Rootless Gentoo Installations ==

Gentoo can be installed in root-less mode.
The packages will be installed as a regular user, for instance in ~/root/.
The user can add the binary/library paths from there and run programs that could not be installed on the system otherwise.

Certain packages will fail to install, because they have not been thought to be installed this way.
The most common reasons are:
* usage of 'install' with root uid/gid
* RESTRICT=userpriv

=== Portage ===

Usage of portage is documented on the gentoo/prefix project.

=== Paludis ===

The steps are:
* install stage3 archive
* install paludis
* edit paludis/distributions/gentoo/e.conf
* add bin/library paths to the environment
* create ~/root/bin/cave, a cave wrapper to contain a few environment variables
* edit ~/.paludis-prefix/specpath.conf
* edit ~/root/etc/paludis/*
* create paludis folders in ~/root/
* cave resolve system -/ n ...
