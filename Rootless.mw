== Rootless Gentoo Installations ==

Gentoo can be installed in root-less mode.
The packages will be installed as a regular user, for instance in ~/root/.
The user can add the binary/library paths from there and run programs that could not be installed on the system otherwise.

Certain packages will fail to install, because they have not been thought to be installed this way.
The most common reasons are:
* usage of 'install' with root uid/gid
* RESTRICT=userpriv

Usage of portage is documented on the gentoo/prefix project.
