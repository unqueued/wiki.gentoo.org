'''vlock''' is a Virtual Console lock program.

== Short Description ==
Sometimes, a malicious local user could cause more problems than a sophisticated remote attack. vlock is a program that locks one or more sessions on the Linux console.

== Install ==
Install {{Package|app-misc/vlock}}:
{{emerge|app-misc/vlock}}

== Use ==
If you aren't already working in a virtual console, switch to it by pressing {{Key|CTRL}}+{{Key|ALT}}+{{Key|F1}}...{{Key|F6}}. By default, vlock locks the current console session. Use the <code>-a</code> switch in order to lock all console sessions.
{{Cmd|vlock -a}}
It is also possible to use vlock from an X session. Just use the <code>-n</code> option to make vlock switch to an empty virtual console.
{{Cmd|vlock -na}}

== Disable SysRq key ==
Magic SysRq key can magically unlock your consoles when you expect it least of all. In order to prevent this, disable the SysRq mechanism while consoles are locked like so:
{{Cmd|vlock -sa}}
If you don't know what SysRq key is, you don't need it. Here is how to disable it when configuring the kernel:
