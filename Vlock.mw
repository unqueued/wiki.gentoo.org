'''vlock''' is a '''V'''irtual Console '''lock''' program.

__TOC__

=== Concepts ===

Sometimes a malicious local user could cause more problems than a sophisticated remote one. vlock is a program that locks one or more sessions on the Linux console to prevent attackers from gaining physical access to the machine.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-misc/vlock|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|app-misc/vlock}}:
|pam+yes
|test
}}

=== Emerge ===

To install {{Package|app-misc/vlock}}:
{{emerge|app-misc/vlock}}

== Usage ==

When not working in a virtual console, switch to one by pressing {{Key|CTRL}}+{{Key|ALT}}+{{Key|F1}} through {{Key|F6}}. By default, {{c|vlock}} locks the current console session. Use the <code>-a</code> switch in order to lock all console sessions.
{{Cmd|vlock -a}}

It is also possible to use vlock from an X session. Use the <code>-n</code> option to make vlock switch to an empty virtual console.
{{Cmd|vlock -na}}

=== Disable SysRq key ===

The magic {{Key|SysRq}} key combination can unlock consoles when least expected. In order to prevent this, disable the SysRq mechanism while consoles are locked like so:

{{Cmd|vlock -sa}}

If a user does not know how to use the {{Key|SysRq}} key, then it is probably not needed. Disable it when configuring the kernel:
