Designed by [https://github.com/kyllikki Vincent Sanders] ([http://www.kyllikki.org/ home page]) and released under MIT licence, [http://kyllikki.github.io/png23d/ PNG23D] is a command line tool allowing to make a 3D file from a PNG image.

Different picture densities define different heights in 3D file generated. All the hard work is to customize source picture, according to PNG23D settings, to get a good printing file.

Many parameters can be set: 3D object sizes, output format (for example <tt>.stl</tt> for printing or <tt>.scad</tt> for editing in [http://www.openscad.org/ OpenScad] ({{Package|media-gfx/openscad}}), height levels number, etc., see [http://kyllikki.github.io/png23d/usage.html PNG23D usage page].

==Installing==

PNG23D is not in Portage tree or Gentoo overlays, so installation is done by compiling sources found on GitHub.

Before compiling, as ''"PNG23D relies on the [http://libpng.org/pub/png/ libpng] library for its PNG image handling"'' (Vincent says), be sure to have installed Gentoo package {{Package|media-libs/libpng}}:

{{Emerge|--search libpng}}

If not installed:

{{Emerge|--ask media-libs/libpng}}

Then [https://github.com/kyllikki/PNG23D download sources] and unzip, then place it for example into Gentoo sources directory: {{Path|/usr/src/png23d-master}}. To compile:

{{RootCmd|cd /usr/src/png23d-master|make|make install}}

===Error?===

{{Note|If PNG23D don't compile and error message is generated after make command, like this:}}

{{CodeBox||1=
[…]
bitmap.c:46:25: error: ‘STDIN_FILENO’ undeclared (first use in this function) 
         fp = fdopen(dup(STDIN_FILENO), "rb"); 
                         ^ 
bitmap.c:46:25: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
[…]
}}

… add <code>#include <unistd.h></code> at the beggining of {{Path|/etc/src/png23d-master/bitmap.c}}:

{{CodeBox|lang=C|1=
[…]
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>    /* added line */
#include <png.h>
#include "bitmap.h"
[…]
}}

Then compile again. Compilation output lines beggining with <code>cc -W -Wall -Wundef</code> aren't errors or warnings but make's compilator calls. PNG23D is installed in {{Path|/usr/local/bin/}}.

==Usage==

Typical usage:

{{Cmd|png23d -o stl /path/to/input/file.png /path/to/output/file.stl}}
