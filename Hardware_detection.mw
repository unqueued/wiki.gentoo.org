This article lists and describes several tools used to detect hardware.

== Complete hardware list ==

=== lshw ===
<kbd>lshw</kbd> ({{Package|sys-apps/lshw}}) generates a structured list of detected hardware and their features:
{{Emerge|sys-apps/lshw}}
{{USEflag
|gtk
|sqlite
|static
}}

=== hwinfo ===
<kbd>hwinfo</kbd> ({{Package|sys-apps/hwinfo}}) is the hardware detection of OpenSUSE and shows a lot details:
{{Emerge|sys-apps/hwinfo}}

=== kudzu ===
'''kudzu''' is the hardware detection of Red Hat. Install {{Package|sys-apps/kudzu}}:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/kudzu}}

== Specific hardware ==

=== lspci ===
<kbd>lspci</kbd> ({{Package|sys-apps/pciutils}}) lists all PCI devices connected to the system:
{{Emerge|sys-apps/pciutils}}
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/pciutils
|static-libs
|zlib+yes
}}

lspci detects the devices based on an ID database provided by {{Package|sys-apps/hwids}}. To get a more recent database install a new version of hwids.

=== lsusb ===
<kbd>lsusb</kbd> ({{Package|sys-apps/usbutils}}) lists all USB devices:
{{Emerge|sys-apps/usbutils}}
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/pciutils
|python+yes
|zlib+yes
}}
lsusb detects the devices based on an ID database provided by {{Package|sys-apps/hwids}}. To get a more recent database install a newer version of hwids.

=== lpinfo ===
<kbd>lpinfo</kbd> (part of [[CUPS]]) lists all printers and the used drivers.

* List all connected printers:
: {{RootCmd|lpinfo -v}}

* Lists all available drivers:
: {{RootCmd|lpinfo -m}}

=== scanModem ===
'''scanModem''' finds for a connected modem a suited driver. scanModem is not in the Portage tree, so it has to be manually downloaded and extracted:
{{Cmd|wget http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/scanModem.gz
|gunzip scanModem.gz
|chmod +x scanModem
|./scanModem}}
It will create a folder {{Path|Modem}} and the file {{Path|scanout.something}} contains the wanted information. If a modem is detected, the driver is named next to ''Drivers'', e.g. for a HSF modem:
{{FileBox|filename=./Modem/scanout.something|1=
Driver=hsfmodem-drivers
}}
