This article lists and describes the setup of tools to detect hardware.

== Complete hardware list ==

=== lshw ===
''lshw'' generates a structured list of detected hardware and their featues. Just install {{Package|sys-apps/lshw}}:
{{USEflag
|gtk
|sqlite
|static
}}
{{Emerge|emerge lshw}}

=== hwinfo ===
''hwinfo'' is the hardware detection of OpenSUSE and shows a lot details. Just install{{Package|sys-apps/hwinfo}}:
{{Emerge|hwinfo}}

=== kudzu ===
''kudzu'' is the hardware detection of Red Hat. Just install {{Package|sys-apps/kudzu}}:
{{Emerge|kudzu}}

== Specific hardware ==

=== lspci ===
''lspci'' lists all PCI devices. Just install {{Package|sys-apps/pciutils}}:
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/pciutils
|compress-db
|network-cron
|static-libs
|zlib+yes
}}
{{Emerge|pciutils}}
lspci detects the devices based on an ID database. This database is updated online all the time, so you have to sync form time to time:
{{RootCmd|update-pciids}}

=== lsusb ===
''lsusb'' lists all USB devices. Just install {{Package|sys-apps/usbutils}}:
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/pciutils
|network-cron
|python+yes
|zlib+yes
}}
{{Emerge|usbutils}}
lsusb detects the devices based on an ID database. This database is updated online all the time, so you have to sync form time to time:
{{RootCmd|update-usbids}}

=== lpinfo ===
''lpinfo'' lists all printers and the used drivers. It's part of [[CUPS]].
* '''lpinfo -v''' - lists all connected printers.
* '''lpinfo -m''' - lists all available drivers.

=== scanModem ===
''scanModem'' finds for a connected modem a suited driver. scanModem is not in the Portage tree, so you have to download it yourself and extract it:
{{Cmd|wget http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/scanModem.gz
|gunzip scanModem.gz
|chmod +x scanModem
|./scanModem}}
It will create a folder <tt>Modem</tt> and the file <tt>scanout.something</tt> contains the wanted informations. If a modem is detected, the driver is named next to ''<code>Drivers</code>'', e.g. for aHSF modem:
{{File|./Modem/scanout.something||
Driver{{=}}hsfmodem-drivers
}}
