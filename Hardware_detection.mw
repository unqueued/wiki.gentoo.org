This article lists and describes several tools used to detect hardware.

__TOC__

== Complete hardware list ==

=== lshw ===

<tt>lshw</tt> ({{Package|sys-apps/lshw}}) generates a structured list of detected hardware and their features:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/lshw}}

{{USEflag
|gtk
|sqlite
|static
}}

=== hwinfo ===

<tt>hwinfo</tt> ({{Package|sys-apps/hwinfo}}) is the hardware detection of OpenSUSE and shows a lot details:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/hwinfo}}

=== inxi ===
<tt>inxi</tt> is a system information script for irc, administration, and system troubleshooters.
{{Emerge|sys-apps/inxi}}

=== kudzu ===

<tt>kudzu</tt> is the hardware detection of Red Hat. Install {{Package|sys-apps/kudzu}}:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/kudzu}}

== Specific hardware ==

=== lspci ===

<tt>lspci</tt> ({{Package|sys-apps/pciutils}}) lists all PCI devices connected to the system:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/pciutils}}

{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/pciutils
|kmod+yes++Enable sys-apps/kmod support for the -k switch in lspci
|static-libs
|zlib+yes++Support compressed pci.ids database
}}

lspci detects the devices based on an ID database provided by {{Package|sys-apps/hwids}}. To get a more recent database install a new version of hwids.

=== lsusb ===

<tt>lsusb</tt> ({{Package|sys-apps/usbutils}}) lists all USB devices:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/usbutils}}

{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/pciutils
|python+yes
|zlib+yes
}}

<tt>lsusb</tt> detects the devices based on an ID database provided by {{Package|sys-apps/hwids}}. To get a more recent database install a newer version of hwids.

=== lpinfo ===

<tt>lpinfo</tt> (part of [[CUPS]]) lists all printers and the used drivers.

List all connected printers:

{{RootCmd|lpinfo -v}}

Lists all available drivers:

{{RootCmd|lpinfo -m}}

=== scanModem ===

<tt>scanModem</tt> finds for a connected modem a suited driver. scanModem is not in the Portage tree, so it has to be manually downloaded and extracted:

{{Cmd|wget http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/scanModem.gz
|gunzip scanModem.gz
|chmod +x scanModem
|./scanModem}}

It will create a folder {{Path|Modem}} and the file {{Path|scanout.something}} contains the wanted information. If a modem is detected, the driver is named next to ''Drivers'', e.g. for a HSF modem:

{{FileBox|filename=./Modem/scanout.something|1=
Driver=hsfmodem-drivers
}}
