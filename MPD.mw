'''MPD''' ('''M'''usic '''P'''layer '''D'''aemon) is a flexible, server-side application for playing music. Through plugins and libraries it can play a variety of sound files while being controlled by its network protocol. For more information, read about [http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/What_MPD_Is_and_Is_Not what mpd is and is not].

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|media-sound/mpd}}. Following minimal USE flags set is needed to be able to play most known audio file formats, and to listen to audio streams. For more features review the USE flags. 
{{USEflag|package=media-sound/mpd}}
Note that a number of these flags are added by the desktop profile.
{{Emerge|mpd}}

== Configuration ==
After finished installation MPD should be working with the Gentoo shipped default configuration. 

=== Basic configuration ===
Below an example of a simple configuration:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/mpd.conf|1=
music_directory      "/var/lib/mpd/music"
playlist_directory   "/var/lib/mpd/playlists"
db_file              "/var/lib/mpd/database"
log_file             "/var/lib/mpd/log"
state_file           "/var/lib/mpd/state"

user                 "mpd"

bind_to_address      "localhost"
bind_to_address      "/var/lib/mpd/socket"

input {
        plugin "curl"
}
}}
At this point MPD should be able to run as a system daemon with its own user called ''mpd'', which is the default setting of MPD.

=== Service ===
You can now start MPD:
{{RootCmd|rc-service mpd start}}

To start MPD at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add mpd default}}

=== PulseAudio (optional) ===
If MPD was build with [[PulseAudio]] support (''pulseaudio'' USE flag), add a dedicated ''audio_output'' section to your {{Path|/etc/mpd.conf}}:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/mpd.conf|1=
audio_output {
        type            "pulse"
        name            "Pulse Output"
        mixer_control   "Master"
}
}}

{{Note|It may be a good practice to [[#Running as a specific user|run both PulseAudio and MPD under X11 user instead]].}}

=== Built-in HTTP streaming server (optional) ===
If MPD was build with ''network'' USE flag, add a dedicated ''audio_output'' section to your {{Path|/etc/mpd.conf}}:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/mpd.conf|1=
audio_output {    
        type            "httpd"
        name            "HTTP Stream"
        encoder         "vorbis"                # optional, vorbis(OGG) or lame(MP3)
        port            "8000"
        bitrate         "192"                   # do not define if quality is defined      
        format          "44100:16:1"
}

bind_to_address "0.0.0.0"
}}
Replace ''localhost'' with ''0.0.0.0'' or a specific interface IP.
Bind to address ''0.0.0.0'' means here: stream on all local found IP interfaces. 
You could change it to a specific interface IP address like f.e. ''192.168.1.2'' then the streaming server is bound to that interface IP only. 

{{Note| Some players require to specify the file format in the URL to be able to connect to the stream. Example: <tt><nowiki>http://192.168.1.2:8000/mpd.ogg</nowiki></tt>}}

=== Running as a specific user (optional) ===
[[#PulseAudio|Sometimes]] it may be handy to run MPD as a specific user.

Start with copying {{Path|/etc/mpd.conf}} to {{Path|~/.mpdconf}}. There are some changes that you will have to change in order to run MPD as a user, most importantly ''user'' and ''group'', also make sure the various path settings are correct:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.mpdconf|title=user definition|1=
user    "YOUR_USER"
group   "YOUR_USER"
}}
Make sure your user has read access to the directory you specify in ''music_directory''.
{{Note|If your [[cron]] program supports ''@reboot'' you can create a cronjob that has /usr/bin/mpd start at boot in place of the init script.}}

=== Bluetooth Headset (optional) ===
Setup your Bluetooth headset first, according to [[Bluetooth_Headset|this wiki]].

==== ALSA (non-PulseAudio) setup with BlueZ 5 ====
Put a user level {{Path|~/.asoundrc}} file in MPD's ''$HOME'' directory, which is {{Path|/var/lib/mpd}} by default. MPD will be able to control the volume of the headset.

{{FileBox|filename=/var/lib/mpd/.asoundrc|1=
# Specify the parameters of the Bluetooth connection
defaults.bluealsa {
     interface "hci0"            # host Bluetooth adapter
     device "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"  # Bluetooth headset MAC address
     profile "a2dp"
}
}}

To be able to switch between the Bluetooth headset and the default sound card, add these lines to the ''audio_output'' section in {{Path|/etc/mpd.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/mpd.conf|1=
audio_output {
        type            "alsa"
        name            "My ALSA Device"
}

audio_output {
        type            "alsa"
        name            "ALSA Bluetooth Headset"
        device          "bluealsa"
        mixer_type      "software"
}
}}

MPD might crash when switching output _while_ playing (if so, pause before switching).

==== ALSA (non-PulseAudio) setup with BlueZ 4 (deprecated) ====
Put a user level {{Path|~/.asoundrc}} file in MPD's ''$HOME'' directory, which is {{Path|/var/lib/mpd}} by default. The following example creates an extra "Bluetooth" slider in any mixer application, and enables MPD to control the volume of the headset:

{{FileBox|filename=/var/lib/mpd/.asoundrc|1=
# Change device to the MAC address of your headset
pcm.btheadset {
   type plug
   slave {
      pcm {
         type bluetooth
         device "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
         profile "auto"
      }
   }
   hint {
      show on
      description "Bluetooth Headset"
   }
}

ctl.btheadset {
   type bluetooth
}

pcm.btheadset_softvol {
   type softvol
   slave.pcm "btheadset"
   control.name "Bluetooth"
   control.card 0
}

# Using bluetooth as default:
#pcm.!default {
#   type plug
#   slave.pcm "btheadset_softvol"
#}
}}

To be able to switch between the Bluetooth headset and the default sound card, add these lines to the ''audio_output'' section in {{Path|/etc/mpd.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/mpd.conf|1=
audio_output {
        type            "alsa"
        name            "My ALSA Device"
}

audio_output {
        type            "alsa"
        name            "ALSA Bluetooth Headset"
        device          "btheadset_softvol"
        mixer_type      "software"
}
}}

MPD might go crazy when switching output _while_ playing, and fill its log (if so, pause before switching).
