SparkleShare is a cross platform, open source, Dropbox-like, file synchronization tool. SparkleShare harnesses the powerful back end of the Git version control system and OpenSSH to provide version controlled backups of every file placed in its repository. The SparkleShare client provides a simple user interface in the form of a small tray applet.

SparkleShare is broken into two components: a client and a host. This article will help the user install and configure both the client and the host in order to have a fully working environment.

== Setup ==
There are no use flags currently setup for SparkleShare.

==Features and Limitations==
Version control is built into SparkleShare which makes it perfect for the self-hosting of text-based files, office documents, and small images such as PNG files. Since Git does not do well handling binary or compressed files, SparkleShare does not make a good “full computer” backup utility. It also does not do well handling binary files or files in semi-compressed/compressed states. Most modern media files such as .OGG, .MP3, .AAC, .MPEG, .JPEGS, etc. are already in semi-compressed/compressed states and should try to be avoided in SparkleShare projects.

==Planned Features==
There are plans to include [https://github.com/Mighty-M/git-bin git-bin] in SparkleShare which would greatly improve it's capabilities in dealing with large files in binary and compressed format, however the implementation of git-bin into SparkleShare is yet to be complete. The developer may never complete this feature; if it's something you think you could help with visit the [https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare SparkleShare GitHub page].

==SparkleShare Client==

===Building and Installation===
Install {{Package|net-misc/sparkleshare}}:

{{RootCmd| emerge -a net-misc/sparkleshare
}}


==SparkleShare Host==
===Dependancies===
Installing the Host side of SparkleShare requires more shell configuration than the client side. In order to setup a host you'll need the following dependencies:

dev-vcs/git

net-misc/openssh

===Installation===

The first step is to download the Dazzle script from the [https://github.com/hbons/Dazzle Dazzle GitHub page]:
{{Note|In order to download using the <code>wget</code> command you will need to download emerge the {{Package|net-misc/wget}} package:
{{RootCmd|emerge net-misc/wget}}
}}

{{RootCmd|wget <nowiki>https://raw.github.com/hbons/Dazzle/master/dazzle.sh</nowiki> -O /usr/local/bin/dazzle}}

Next make the script executable by using the <code>chmod +x</code> command:
{{RootCmd|chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dazzle}}

Update your shell's profile to grant yourself access to your new Dazzle script:
{{RootCmd|source /etc/profile}}

After that you'll need to run the <code>dazzle setup</code> command to setup your project(s):
{{RootCmd|dazzle setup}}

Add each user's SSH key to the SparkleShare host by using the <code>dazzle link</code> command. The SparkleShare client will generate the SSH key for you to you. Simply right click on the notification tray icon on the client PC to copy the SSH key to the computer clipboard. You could either put the users SSH key on a USB drive or you could transfer the ssh key using the <code>scp</code>. It doesn't matter how you transfer the key, as long as you can enter it into the <code>dazzle link</code> command when prompted.
{{RootCmd|dazzle link}}

After you have finished granting your users access to the SparkleShare service on your host system you will need to create one or more projects so that you have some repositories to contribute to. Use the <code>dazzle create</code> command followed by the project name to generate your project(s):
{{RootCmd|dazzle create PROJECT_NAME}}

That's it! You've successfully configured your host!
