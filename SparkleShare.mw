SparkleShare is [[Article description::a cross platform, free, open source, Dropbox-like, git-based collaboration and file sharing tool.]] SparkleShare harnesses the powerful back end of the Git version control system and OpenSSH to provide version controlled backups of each file placed in its repository. The SparkleShare client provides a super simple user interface in the form of a small tray applet.

SparkleShare is broken into two components: a ''client'' and a ''host''. This article will help the user install and configure both components in order to obtain a working SparkleShare environment.

== USE Configuration ==

There are currently no USE flags for SparkleShare.

== Features and limitations ==

Version control is built into SparkleShare which makes it perfect for the self-hosting of text-based files, office documents, and small image files. Since Git does not do well handling binary or compressed files, SparkleShare does '''not''' make a good full computer backup utility. It also does not do well handling binary files or files in semi-compressed or compressed states. Most modern media files (such as {{Path|.ogg}}, {{Path|.mp3}}, {{Path|.aac}}, {{Path|.mpeg}}, {{Path|.jpeg}}, etc.) are already in semi-compressed or compressed states and should not be added to SparkleShare repositories.

=== Future ===

There are plans to include [https://github.com/Mighty-M/git-bin git-bin] in SparkleShare which would greatly improve its capabilities in dealing with binary and any files in compressed states, however the implementation of git-bin into SparkleShare is yet to be complete. The developer may never integrate this feature.

== Client ==

As with most packages in the Portage Tree, SparkleShare can be installed with a simple emerge command. Emerging {{Package|net-misc/sparkleshare}} will install both the host and the client SparkleShare components:

{{Emerge|net-misc/sparkleshare}}

If the current PC is a client, the installation is now complete. The client should now show up in the desktop environment's list of installed programs. After it is started a small applet should appear in the panel.

For host installation and configuration continue reading.

== Host ==

Installing the SparkleShare ''host'' requires a bit more configuration than the client.

The first step in host configuration is to download the Dazzle script from the [https://github.com/hbons/Dazzle Dazzle GitHub page]. This will require the use of web browser or a command line download utility (<tt>curl</tt> or <tt>wget</tt>).

{{Note|In order to use {{c|wget}} command install the {{Package|net-misc/wget}} package. This package should come installed on Gentoo systems by default.}}

{{RootCmd|wget <nowiki>https://raw.github.com/hbons/Dazzle/master/dazzle.sh</nowiki> -O /usr/local/bin/dazzle}}

Next make the script executable by using {{c|chmod}}:

{{RootCmd|chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dazzle}}

Update the system profile to make the Dazzle script located in {{Path|/usr/local/bin}} visible as a system command:
{{RootCmd|source /etc/profile}}

After that run {{c|dazzle setup}} to setup the SparkleShare ''host'':

{{RootCmd|dazzle setup}}

Add each user's SSH key to the SparkleShare host by using {{c|dazzle link}}.

The SparkleShare ''client'' will generate a SSH key pair combination on the client system. Right click the notification tray icon to copy the SSH key to the clipboard. It is then possible to use {{c|ssh}} to run the {{c|dazzel link}} on the host system, and the ssh key can be copied into the {{Path|dazzel}} script.

Alternatively the users' SSH key can be put on a USB drive or transferred using {{c|scp}}. Ultimately it does not matter how the key is transfers, as long as it can be entered on the host when {{Path|dazzle}} prompts.

{{RootCmd|dazzle link}}

After the user has been granted access to the SparkleShare service on the host system one more more projects will need to be created. Each project is new a repository. Use {{c|dazzle create}} on the ''host'' followed by the project name to generate the project(s):

{{RootCmd|dazzle create PROJECT_NAME}}

{{Note|Run the above step for as many projects as desired.}}

That is it! The host has successfully been configured!
