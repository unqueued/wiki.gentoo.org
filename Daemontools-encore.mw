[[Daemontools-encore]] is a supersion suite, successor of [[Daemontools]], along the line of [[Runit]] or [[S6]] minus the [[Comparison of init systems|init]] or PID 1 replacement; or rather, a UNIX services management utility in other words. The ''Encore'' suffix stand for further enhancement compared to the first iterration of the utility while keeping backward compatibility to [[Daemontools]].

== Installation ==

{{emerge|daemontools-encore}}

== Configuration ==

Refer to [[S6]] or [[Runit]] article for more info on process supervision which are applicable ''as is'' for [[Daemontools]] and [[Daemontools-encore]] because the process management or supervision API used is the same for the four projects.
