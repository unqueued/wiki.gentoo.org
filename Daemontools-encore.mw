[[Daemontools-encore]] is a supersion suite, sueccessor of [[Daemontools]], along the line of [[Runit]] or [[S6]] minus the [[Comparisaon of init systems|init]] or PID 1 replacement; or rather, a UNIX services management utilities to state it in other words. The ''Encore'' suffix stand for further enhancement compared to the first iterration of the utilities while keeping backward compatibility.
