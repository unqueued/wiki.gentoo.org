''The /usr move'' is a concept of moving various applications installed into the filesystem root to /usr prefix in order to unify the filesystem layout.

A [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsrMove similar concept is being considered in Fedora] yet it assumes that the rootfs directories would become symlinks to /usr counterparts. In Gentoo we are rather considering creating the symlinks for necessary files only.
