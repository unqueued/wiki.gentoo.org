Lenovo Y500 is very good laptop for installing gentoo:
* It has powerful CPU for fast compilations
* SSD to make all portage operations very quick.
* All hardware I used in it is supported very well.
Here is a guide how to make gentoo up and running on it
Also I think most of staff here applies for Lenovo Y510 as well.

== Some Y500 specific workarounds ==
These are workarounds to setup hardware which does not work well out of the box
=== Ethernet ===
For the kernels older than 3.11 development branch it's necessary to use backports:
# Download latest backports from [https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable here] . I used this driver [https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.10/backports-3.10-2.tar.bz2 backports-3.10-2.tar.bz2]
# Unpack somewhere
# run make menuconfig

Go inside  Ethernet driver support and check Atheros AR8161 driver:
{{Kernel|Ethernet driver support |<pre>

 Run following commands to make and install driver to your current kernel: 
## make
## make modules
## make install
## make modules_install
## Afer reboot you kernel should load alx driver automatically. If it's not happen try to run manually modprobe alx.

=== Web Camera===
Nothing really special:
* Check kernel driver called USB Video Class (UVC)

* emerge media-libs/libv4l

=== Touchpad ===
Touch by default is very jumpy.
To workaround it you will have to install following minimum versions of synaptics and evdev: 
<br>x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics-1.8.0
<br>dev-libs/libevdev-1.2.2
<br>That's it. After touchpad works awesome (however on older version it's terrible and jumpy. You would not want even use it ;)
<br>To make cursor less speedy you could use the following config:

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-touchpad.conf||<pre>
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad"
        MatchProduct "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad"
        Driver "synaptics"
        # tweak the X-server pointer acceleration
        Option "AccelerationProfile" "2"
        Option "AdaptiveDeceleration" "16"
        Option "ConstantDeceleration" "16"
        Option "VelocityScale" "32"
EndSection
</pre>}}
If the touchpad is too slow/fast you can play with a speed parameters.
