'''DISCLAIMER:''' Move/edit this wikipage to your best judgement. Recommends making a `hardware` subcategory for end-users to share their experience with hardware.

This is a wiki entry about using [https://www.logitechg.com/en-roeu/products/gaming-audio/g533-wireless-gaming-headset.html Logitech G533] wireless headset on gentoo linux.

== Requirements ==

=== Software ===
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/ALSA

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/PulseAudio

pavucontrol is recommended.

=== Kernel ===
Kernel configuration with `CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=y` is required.

'''MANUAL'''<br />
Modify `/usr/src/<kernel>/.config` with `CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=y`.

'''USING TUI'''<br />
In menuconfig/nconfig invoked from `/usr/src/<kernel>/` navigate to:
'''Device Drivers -> Sound card Support -> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture -> USB sound devices''' and set '''USB Audio/MIDI driver''' as included.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== USB Reciever ===
USB reciever has green LED under "G" logo we assume that USB reciever is plugged in system.

==== LED is blinking ====
1) There is no driver for USB reciever to work.<br>
- a) Check requirements.<br>
- b) If you confirmed that software + kernel configuration is present share your experience in talk page.

2) USB Reciever is not paired.<br>
- a) There are two "holes" on USB reciever and headset. Take a paper clip and insert it in USB reciever and headset. 

Holes are located:<br>
USB reciever = above LED and under "G" logo.<br>
Headset = Left reproductor above "G" logo. Note that i's hidden under plastic piece of skeleton. <br>

Press and hold untill both USB reciever and headset are blinking rapidly which indicated pairing mode.

'''WARNING:''' USE light pressure or you might damage the hardware button forcing it in constant ON position looping in pairing mode!!

==== LED is ON ====
1) Connection with headset is successful and there is no issue from headset and USB reciever. <br>
- a) If the headset is still not working check `pavucontrol`. We can eliminate issue with USB reciever and headset from troubleshooting.

==== LED is OFF ====
1) Corrupted firmware.<br>
- a) Logitech provides software called "Logitech Gaming Software" which support only windows. If you install it using wine or virtualbox on windows there is "FWupdate" folder in it's root directory which has firmware recovery software for all supported hardware saved in .exe to recover your firmware.

Warning: if using virtualbox you need to remount the USB connection for USB reciever and headset multiple times. Installation will freeze untill remount it completed.

2) Hardware damage.
