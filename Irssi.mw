'''irssi''' is a powerful command line IRC client for connecting to internet relay chat (IRC) networks. Non-standard features are implemented with perl scripts, rather than in the core. Irssi can range from a functional, no-frills client to a highly-customized and automated client.<ref>http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi/</ref> Irssi can handle multiple IRC connections simultaneously, thus it is possible to be active in channels on different networks at the same time.<ref>http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi/</ref>

== Install ==

{{USEflag|package=net-irc/irssi
|ipv6+yes+yes
|perl++yes
|socks5
|ssl+yes+yes
}}

Install {{package|net-irc/irssi}}:

{{emerge|net-irc/irssi}}

To run the program, simply open up a terminal and type <kbd>irssi</kbd>. Read the manual <kbd>man irssi</kbd> to see all available command line options.

==Configuring irssi==
The first time irssi is invoked a configuration file will be created for in {{Path|$HOME/.irssi/config}} This can be modified with the <tt>/set</tt> command while in the client by typing <tt>/set option value</tt>. Type <tt>/set</tt> by it's self to see all available options and their current value.

For changes to remain persistent over restarts, modify the configuration file found at {{Path|$HOME/.irssi/config}}. See the following example:

{{FileBox|filename=$HOME/.irssi/config|title=example configuration|1=
...
settings = {
  ...
  core = { real_name = "Larry The Cow"; user_name = "larrytc"; nick = "larry"; };
  ...
};
}}

== Using irssi ==
Start irssi:
{{Cmd|irssi}}

While in the irssi interface command-line options can be issued in order to have irssi perform the desired actions.
Connect to a IRC network, here irc.freenode.net:

<kbd>/connect chat.freenode.net</kbd>

Set a user name f.e. larry:
<kbd>/nick larry</kbd>

Starting irssi using the above options with one command line invocation:
{{Cmd|irssi -c chat.freenode.net -n larry}}

Join a IRC channel f.e. #gentoo:
<kbd>/join #gentoo</kbd>

Leave a channel:
<kbd>/leave #gentoo</kbd>

Save configured irssi settings:
<kbd>/save</kbd>

Quit an irssi IRC session:
<kbd>/exit</kbd>

=== irssi with screen ===
Screen is a highly useful tool that allows a user to manipulate multiple windows inside of a single session. Each window operates independently of the others and acts like another terminal.<ref>http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi/</ref>

To install screen, or for more information in general, see the [[screen|screen article]].

If irssi is currently open, close it using the /quit command and start screen by simply typing
{{Cmd|screen}}
This opens a new screen session. To someone who has not used screen before it may appear that running the <kbd>screen</kbd> above did nothing. There was something that actually happened by running screen, using the <tt>-list</tt> option will show the user that there is now an open screen session: 
{{Cmd|screen -list}}

Starting irssi ''inside'' the screen session will create a helpful use case. Start irssi again ''inside'' the screen session
{{Cmd|irssi}}

While inside a screen session special keystrokes can be used in order to control screen. Pressing {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|a}} is the keystroke needed to beseech control of screen. 

==== Detaching screen sessions ====
To detach a screen session press: {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|a}}+{{Key|d}}

==== Attaching screen sessions ====
To reattach to a running screen session type
{{Cmd|screen -rd}}

=== irssi with tmux ===
