'''irssi''' is a powerful command line IRC client for connecting to internet relay chat (IRC) networks. Non-standard features are implemented with perl scripts, rather than in the core. Irssi can range from a functional, no-frills client to a highly-customized and automated client.<ref>Matt Sparks.

== Install ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-irc/irssi|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|net-irc/irssi}}:
|ipv6+yes+yes
|perl++yes
|socks5
|ssl+yes+yes
}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|net-irc/irssi}}:

{{Emerge|net-irc/irssi}}

To run the program, simply open up a terminal and type <tt>irssi</tt>. Read the manual <tt>man irssi</tt> to see all available command-line options. More on using Irssi can be found in the usage section below.

== Configuration ==

The first time <tt>irssi</tt> is invoked by a user a configuration file will be created in {{Path|~/.irssi/config}} This can be modified with the <tt>/set</tt> command while in the client by typing <tt>/set option value</tt>. Typing <tt>/set</tt> by itself will display available options and their current values.

For changes to remain persistent over restarts, modify the configuration file found at {{Path|~/.irssi/config}}. See the following example:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.irssi/config|title=Example configuration|1=
...
settings = {
  ...
  core = { real_name = "Larry The Cow"; user_name = "larrytc"; nick = "larry"; };
  ...
};
}}

== Usage ==

As mentioned above <tt>irssi</tt> is started by invoking:

{{Cmd|irssi}}

While in the Irssi interface command-line options can be issued in order to have Irssi perform the desired actions.

Connect to a IRC network, here <code>irc.freenode.net</code>:

<kbd>/connect chat.freenode.net</kbd>

Set the user name to <code>larry</code>:

<kbd>/nick larry</kbd>

Starting <tt>irssi</tt> using the above options with one command-line invocation:

{{Cmd|irssi -c chat.freenode.net -n larry}}

Join the <code>#gentoo</code> IRC channel:

<kbd>/join #gentoo</kbd>

Leave the <code>#gentoo</code> channel:

<kbd>/leave #gentoo</kbd>

Save configured settings:

<kbd>/save</kbd>

Quit an Irssi IRC session:

<kbd>/quit</kbd> or <kbd>/exit</kbd>

=== Screen ===

<tt>screen</tt> is a useful tool that allows a user to manipulate multiple windows inside of a single terminal session. Each window operates independently of the others and acts like another terminal.<ref>Matt Sparks. [http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi/ A Guide to Efficiently Using Irssi and Screen], [http://quadpoint.org/ Matt Sparks], December 19th, 2004. Retrieved on January 10th, 2015.</ref>

To install <tt>screen</tt>, or for more information in general, see the [[screen|screen article]].

If <tt>irssi</tt> is currently open, close it using the <tt>/quit</tt> command and start screen by typing:

{{Cmd|screen}}

This opens a new screen session. To someone who has not used screen before it may appear that invoking the <tt>screen</tt> command above did nothing. This is not the case; there was something that happened by running screen, using the <code>-list</code> option will show the user that there is now an open screen session:

{{Cmd|screen -list}}

Starting <tt>irssi</tt> ''inside'' the screen session will create a helpful use case. Start <tt>irssi</tt> again ''inside'' the <tt>screen</tt> session:

{{Cmd|irssi}}

While inside a <tt>screen</tt> session special keystrokes are used in order to provide control. {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|a}} is the keystroke needed to beseech control of screen. 

==== Detaching screen sessions ====

To detach a <tt>screen</tt> session press: {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|a}} then {{Key|d}}

==== Attaching screen sessions ====

To re-attach to a running <tt>screen</tt> session type:

{{Cmd|screen -rd}}

=== tmux ===

<tt>tmux</tt> is another good way to manage <tt>irssi</tt> sessions. Start a <tt>tmux</tt> session for <tt>irssi</tt> by typing:

{{Cmd|tmux new-session -s irssi}}

Once inside the <tt>tmux</tt> session start <tt>irssi</tt> by typing:

{{Cmd|prompt=user (tmux session)|irssi}}

{{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|b}} is the keystroke needed to grab control of <tt>tmux</tt>. To detach the <tt>irssi</tt> session press {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|b}} then the {{Key|d}} key. If everything went properly the <tt>irssi</tt> session should detach and the focus returned to the shell prompt.

To re-attach a session use the <tt>attach-session -t <session_name> </tt> argument (where <code><session_name></code> is the name used for the <tt>irssi</tt> session):

{{Cmd|tmux attach-session -t irssi}}

For more information on the details of using <tt>tmux</tt> see the [[tmux|<tt>tmux</tt> article]].
