'''irssi''' is [[Article description::a powerful text-mode IRC client for connecting to internet relay chat (IRC) networks.]] Non-standard features are implemented with perl scripts, rather than in the core. Irssi can range from a functional, no-frills client to a highly-customized and automated client.<ref>Matt Sparks.

Retrieved on January 10th, 2015.</ref> Irssi can handle multiple IRC connections simultaneously, thus it is possible to be active in channels on different networks at the same time.<ref>Matt Sparks.

== Install ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-irc/irssi}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{Package|net-irc/irssi}}:

{{Emerge|net-irc/irssi}}

To run the program, simply open up a terminal and type {{c|irssi}}. Read the manual <kbd>man irssi</kbd> to see all available command-line options. More on using Irssi can be found in the usage section below.

== Configuration ==

The first time {{c|irssi}} is invoked by a user a configuration file will be created in {{Path|~/.irssi/config}} This can be modified with the {{c|/set}} command while in the client by typing <kbd>/set option value</kbd>. Typing <kbd>/set</kbd> by itself will display available options and their current values.

For changes to remain persistent over restarts, modify the configuration file found at {{Path|~/.irssi/config}}. See the following example:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.irssi/config|title=Example configuration|1=
...
settings = {
  ...
  core = { real_name = "Larry The Cow"; user_name = "larrytc"; nick = "larry"; };
  ...
};
}}

== Usage ==

As mentioned above {{c|irssi}} is started by invoking:

{{Cmd|irssi}}

While in the Irssi interface command-line options can be issued in order to have Irssi perform the desired actions.

Connect to a IRC network, here <code>irc.freenode.net</code>:

<kbd>/connect chat.freenode.net</kbd>

Set the user name to <code>larry</code>:

<kbd>/nick larry</kbd>

Starting {{c|irssi}} using the above options with one command-line invocation:

{{Cmd|irssi -c chat.freenode.net -n larry}}

Join the <code>#gentoo</code> IRC channel:

<kbd>/join #gentoo</kbd>

Leave the <code>#gentoo</code> channel:

<kbd>/leave #gentoo</kbd>

Save configured settings:

<kbd>/save</kbd>

Quit an Irssi IRC session:

<kbd>/quit</kbd> or <kbd>/exit</kbd>

=== Screen ===

{{c|screen}} is a useful tool that allows a user to manipulate multiple windows inside of a single terminal session. Each window operates independently of the others and acts like another terminal.<ref>Matt Sparks. [http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi/ A Guide to Efficiently Using Irssi and Screen], [http://quadpoint.org/ Matt Sparks], December 19th, 2004. Retrieved on January 10th, 2015.</ref>

To install {{c|screen}}, or for more information in general, see the [[screen|screen article]].

If {{c|irssi}} is currently open, close it using the {{c|/quit}} command and start screen by typing:

{{Cmd|screen}}

This opens a new screen session. To someone who has not used screen before it may appear that invoking the {{c|screen}} command above did nothing. This is not the case; there was something that happened by running screen, using the <code>-list</code> option will show the user that there is now an open screen session:

{{Cmd|screen -list}}

Starting {{c|irssi}} ''inside'' the screen session will create a helpful use case. Start {{c|irssi}} again ''inside'' the {{c|screen}} session:

{{Cmd|irssi}}

While inside a {{c|screen}} session special keystrokes are used in order to provide control. {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|a}} is the keystroke needed to beseech control of screen. 

==== Detaching screen sessions ====

To detach a {{c|screen}} session press: {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|a}} then {{Key|d}}

==== Attaching screen sessions ====

To re-attach to a running {{c|screen}} session type:

{{Cmd|screen -rd}}

=== tmux ===

{{c|tmux}} is another good way to manage {{c|irssi}} sessions. Start a {{c|tmux}} session for {{c|irssi}} by typing:

{{Cmd|tmux new-session -s irssi}}

Once inside the {{c|tmux}} session start {{c|irssi}} by typing:

{{Cmd|prompt=user (tmux session)|irssi}}

{{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|b}} is the keystroke needed to grab control of {{c|tmux}}. To detach the {{c|irssi}} session press {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|b}} then the {{Key|d}} key. If everything went properly the {{c|irssi}} session should detach and the focus returned to the shell prompt.

To re-attach a session use the <code>attach-session -t <session_name></code> argument (where <code><session_name></code> is the name used for the {{c|irssi}} session):

{{Cmd|tmux attach-session -t irssi}}

For more information on the details of using {{c|tmux}} see the [[tmux|{{c|tmux}} article]].
