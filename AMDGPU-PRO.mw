'''AMDGPU-PRO''' is [[Article description::a ''closed source'' graphic component that operates on top of the open source [[AMDGPU]] drivers for newer AMD/ATI Radeon graphics cards.]]

Users whose main use for their graphics card is gaming and other general graphical hardware acceleration, should use the open source [[AMDGPU]] drivers instead, since the performance of the open source drivers can be as much 100% more compared to AMDGPU-PRO.<ref>[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=rx550-open-hybrid&num=2 Phoronix - Radeon RX 550: AMDGPU-PRO vs. DRM-Next + Mesa 17.2-dev] - ”''Similar to what we've been seeing on other AMD hardware, the pure open-source driver stack can be much faster than AMDGPU-PRO.''”</ref>

AMDGPU-PRO is currently ''not'' distributed within Gentoo's default package manager.
