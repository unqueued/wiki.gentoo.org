Qt applications like {{Package|media-video/vlc}} or {{Package|sci-chemistry/avogadro}} need a little help to use your desktop theme in GNOME.

== Setup ==
There is an easy way by setting '''gtkstyle''' useflag for {{Package|x11-libs/qt-gui}} and by using split ebuild for the style.

=== Easy way ===
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use|Add|x11-libs/qt-gui gtkstyle}}
{{Emerge|params=-1av|x11-libs/qt-gui}}

=== Using split ebuild ===
{{Package|x11-themes/qgtkstyle}} - Qt style that uses the active GTK+ theme

It is masked, so it has to be unmasked first:
{{File|/etc/portage/package.unmask|Add|x11-themes/qgtkstyle}}
The version of {{Package|x11-themes/qgtkstyle}} has to be the same as for {{Package|x11-libs/qt-gui}}. If needed bump its version in your local overlay (renaming the ebuild should be enough).
{{Emerge|x11-themes/qgtkstyle}}

== Configuration ==
You might need to reselect the prefered theme for Qt applications using ''qtconfig'' (from {{Package|x11-libs/qt-qt3support}}):
{{Cmd|qtconfig}}
or just delete the previous configuration files:
{{Cmd|rm -r ~/.config/Trolltech*}}
Select '''Default''' theme to use your system settings or set it to use {{Package|x11-themes/qgtkstyle}} explicitly by selecting '''GTK+''' theme.

=== Tips ===
* Individual applications might have their own configuration settings for GUI, e.g. in VLC there is Tools â†’ Preferences setting for this.
