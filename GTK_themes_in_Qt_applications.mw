[[Qt Desktop applications]] need a little help to use your desktop theme in [[GNOME]].

== Setup ==
The GTK+ style for Qt can be built by setting the ''gtk'' USE flag for {{Package|dev-qt/qtwidgets}}.

Set the ''gtkstyle'' USE flag.:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|1=
dev-qt/qtwidgets gtk
}}
and rebuild the package with its new USE flag:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use|qtgui}}

== Configuration ==
You might need to reselect the preferred theme for Qt applications using ''qtconfig'' (from {{Package|dev-qt/qt3support}}):
{{Cmd|qtconfig}}
or just delete the previous configuration files:
{{Cmd|rm -r ~/.config/Trolltech*}}
Select the '''Default''' theme to use your system settings or set it to use the '''GTK+''' style explicitly by selecting '''GTK+''' theme.

=== Tips ===
* Individual applications might have their own configuration settings for their GUI, e.g. in VLC this is located in Tools â†’ Preferences.

== Caveats ==
* 32bit applications on multilib systems are still unaware of the system's GTK+ theme, probably because {{Package|app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-qtlibs}} is compiled without the '''gtkstyle''' USE flag enabled.

== GTK+2 alternative ==
An alternative for users of GTK+2 and Qt5 is using the QtCurve cross-toolkit theme:
{{emerge|qtcurve}}
The downsides of this method are that it's not available for GTK+3 yet, and currently the only configuration GUI needs Qt5 and KDE Frameworks 5.
