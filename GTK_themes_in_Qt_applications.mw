[[Qt Desktop applications]] need a little help to use your desktop theme in [[GNOME]].

== Setup ==
The GTK style for Qt can be built by setting the <code>gtk</code> <var>USE</var> flag for {{Package|dev-qt/qtwidgets}}.

Set the <code>gtk</code> <var>USE</var> flag:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|1=
dev-qt/qtwidgets gtk
}}
Now rebuild the package with its new <var>USE</var> flag:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use|qtwidgets}}

== Configuration ==
You might need to reselect the preferred theme for Qt applications using ''qtconfig'' (from {{Package|dev-qt/qt3support}}):
{{Cmd|qtconfig}}
or just delete the previous configuration files:
{{Cmd|rm -r ~/.config/Trolltech*}}
Select the '''Default''' theme to use your system settings or set it to use the '''GTK''' style explicitly by selecting '''GTK''' theme.

=== Tips ===
* Individual applications might have their own configuration settings for their GUI, e.g. in VLC this is located in Tools â†’ Preferences.

== GTK 2 alternative ==
An alternative for users of GTK 2 and Qt5 is using the QtCurve cross-toolkit theme:
{{emerge|qtcurve}}
The downsides of this method are that it's not available for GTK 3 yet, and currently the only configuration GUI needs Qt5 and KDE Frameworks 5.
