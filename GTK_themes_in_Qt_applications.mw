[[Qt Desktop applications]] need a little help to use your desktop theme in [[GNOME]].

== Setup ==
The GTK+ style for Qt can be built by setting the ''gtkstyle'' USE flag for {{Package|x11-libs/qt-gui}}.

Set the ''gtkstyle'' USE flag. If there is a blocker, unset the '''qt4''' flag in {{Package|x11-libs/cairo}}:
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use||<pre>
x11-libs/qt-gui gtkstyle
x11-libs/cairo -qt4
</pre>}}
and rebuild the packages with their new USE flags:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use|qt-gui cairo}}

== Configuration ==
You might need to reselect the preferred theme for Qt applications using ''qtconfig'' (from {{Package|x11-libs/qt-qt3support}}):
{{Cmd|qtconfig}}
or just delete the previous configuration files:
{{Cmd|rm -r ~/.config/Trolltech*}}
Select the '''Default''' theme to use your system settings or set it to use the '''GTK+''' style explicitly by selecting '''GTK+''' theme.

=== Tips ===
* Individual applications might have their own configuration settings for their GUI, e.g. in VLC this is located in Tools â†’ Preferences.

== Caveats ==
* 32bit applications on multilib systems are still unaware of the system's GTK+ theme, probably because {{Package|app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-qtlibs}} is compiled without the '''gtkstyle''' USE flag enabled.
