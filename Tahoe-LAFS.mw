Tahoe-LAFS ('''L'''east '''A'''uthority '''F'''ile '''S'''ystem) is [[Article description::an encrypted, secure, distributed (fault-tolerant) file system).]] It does not require trust between parties in order to keep data safe and secure; the only caveat being involved parties must leave their system's connected to the storage network.

{{Important|It is important to note that Tahoe-LAFS is written using the Twisted Python libraries therefore it is currently limited to running on Python 2.x interpreters.}}

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

(Optional section. Remove if not applicable.)

{{KernelBox|Title=Enabled support for <Software_title>|1=

Write kernel feature instructions here.

}}

=== USE flags ===

There are only a couple USE flags available for Tahoe-LAFS, neither of them incorporate additional functionality. Essentially when more documentation is desired make sure the <code>doc</code> flag is enabled in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}}.

{{USEflag|package=net-fs/tahoe-lafs}}

=== Emerge ===

Install Tahoe:

{{Emerge|net-fs/tahoe-lafs}}

== Configuration ==

(Needs written...)

== Usage ==

(Needs written...)

=== Invocation ===

Tahoe can be invoked via:

{{Cmd|tahoe}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Emerge fails ===

{{c|emerge}} {{Package|tahoe-lafs}} fails with a <code>pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound</code> error similar to the following:

{{CodeBox|title=Tahoe-LAFS emerge failure|1=

/usr/bin/python2.7 setup.py build

    raise DistributionNotFound(req)

}}

The work around to this problem is to roll back the {{Package|dev-python/setuptools}} package to an earlier version. It appears version 12.0.1 which is currently marked as stable on {{Keyword|amd64}} as an issue determining versioning for Python dependencies. Rolling back to version 7.0 should do the trick:

{{Emerge|{{=}}dev-python/setuptools-7.0}}

After the new version of {{Package|dev-python/setuptools}} is installed proceed with [[#Installation|installation process]] as normal.
