'''FASM''' is [[Article description::a fast assembly language compiler for the x86 architecture processors]], which does multiple passes to optimize the size of generated machine code. It is self-compilable and versions for different operating systems are provided. All the versions are designed to be used from the system command line and they should not differ in behavior. This program is written by Tomasz Grysztar.
