__TOC__

=== About ===
The Gentoo [https://linux-hardware.org/?d=Gentoo Hardware Database] is automatically created based on hardware probes collected by [http://gpo.zugaina.org/sys-apps/hw-probe sys-apps/hw-probe], by [https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe#appimage hw-probe.AppImage] or by [https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.linux_hardware.hw-probe this flatpak].

It is a part of the global [https://linux-hardware.org/?d=All Linux Hardware Database].
