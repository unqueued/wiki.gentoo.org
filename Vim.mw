[http://www.vim.org/ '''Vim'''] is a text editor based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi vi]. It can be used from the command line or as a standalone application with graphical user interface. The name Vim comes from '''V'''i '''IM'''proved.
== Installation ==
If you want to install Vim with both the ncurses-based interface for the terminal (<code>/usr/bin/vim</code>) and the graphical interface for X (<code>/usr/bin/gvim</code>), just type:
{{Emerge|app-editors/gvim}}
If you are only interested in using Vim in a terminal, type:
{{Emerge|app-editors/vim}}
There is also an experimental Qt interface called vim-qt, available in the qt overlay.
=== Extensions ===
The category ''app-vim'' provides a lot of additional syntax definitions, plugins and other Vim related stuff.
{{Cmd|emerge --search "%@^app-vim"}}
{{Cmd|eix -cC app-vim}}

== Getting started ==
Vim has a built-in tutorial which should require around 30 min to go trough. Start it using command:
{{Cmd|vimtutor}}

== Modes ==
Vim has 3 modes:
* Command mode: Keystrokes are interpreted as commands
* Insert mode: Keystrokes are interpreted as text (except a few special commands)
* Visual mode: Visual mode supports you by selecting some text. It behaves a lot like command mode

== Tips and Tricks ==

=== Using Vim like ex or ed from the command line ===
Change all startlines from file.txt to startlines with #:
{{Cmd|vim -c ":%s/^}/#}/g" -c ":x" file.txt}}

Change encoding of file to UTF-8:
{{Cmd|vi -c ":wq! ++enc{{=}}utf8" file.txt}}
