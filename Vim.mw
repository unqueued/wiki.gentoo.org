=== Command-line ===

If X Window System support is not needed, install {{Package|app-editors/vim}}:

{{Emerge|app-editors/vim}}

=== GUI ===

To install Vim with both the ncurses-based interface ({{Path|/usr/bin/vim}})) and the graphical interface (for the X Window System - {{Path|/usr/bin/gvim}}), install {{Package|app-editors/gvim}}:

{{Emerge|app-editors/gvim}}

There is also an experimental [[Qt]] interface called {{Package|app-editors/vim-qt}} which can also be emerged.

=== Extensions === <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
The category ''app-vim'' provides a lot of additional syntax definitions, plugins and other Vim related stuff.

<!--T:11-->
Use <tt>emerge</tt> or <tt>eix</tt> to get an overview of available packages in the ''app-vim'' category:

<!--T:12-->
{{Cmd|emerge --search "%@^app-vim"
|eix -cC app-vim}}

== Configuration ==

Vim can be configured on per-user basis or via global defaults.

=== Global ===

The global configuration file for Vim can be found at {{Path|/etc/vim/vimrc}}

=== User ===

The each user's configuration file should be located at {{Path|~/.vimrc}} (the base of the user's home directory).

== Usage == <!--T:13-->

=== Getting started === <!--T:14-->

<!--T:15-->
Vim has a built-in tutorial which should require around 30 min to go through. Start it using the <tt>vimtutor</tt> command:

<!--T:16-->
{{Cmd|vimtutor}}

== Tips and Tricks == <!--T:17-->

=== Using Vim like ex or ed from the command line === <!--T:18-->

<!--T:19-->
It is possible to use Vim for one-liners â€” commands that can be used in scripts or on the command line to make changes in an unattended manner.

<!--T:20-->
For instance, the following command adds <code>#</code> to the beginning of each line in the {{Path|file.txt}} file:

<!--T:21-->
{{Cmd|vim -c ":%s/^/#/g" -c ":x" file.txt}}

<!--T:22-->
What happens is that Vim interprets the passed on commands (through the <code>-c</code> option). The first command is Vim's substitution command (which is very similar to <tt>sed</tt>'s), the second one is Vim's instruction to save and exit the editor.

=== Change file encoding === <!--T:23-->

<!--T:24-->
To change the file encoding of a file to [[UTF-8]], use the following command (in Vim command mode):

<!--T:25-->
{{Cmd|e ++enc{{=}}utf8|prompt=:|color=orange}}

<!--T:26-->
As shown in the previous trick, it is possible to do this from the command line as well:

<!--T:27-->
{{Cmd|vim -c ":wq! ++enc{{=}}utf8" file.txt}}
