[http://www.vim.org/ '''Vim'''] is a text editor based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi vi]. It can be used from the command line or as a standalone application with graphical user interface. The name Vim comes from '''V'''i '''IM'''proved.
== Installation ==
If you want to install Vim with both the ncurses-based interface for the terminal (<code>/usr/bin/vim</code>) and the graphical interface for X (<code>/usr/bin/gvim</code>), just type:
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask {{Package|app-editors/gvim}}}}
If you are only interested in using Vim in a terminal, type
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask {{Package|app-editors/vim}}}}
=== Extensions ===
The category ''app-vim'' provides a lot of additional syntax definitions, plugins and other Vim related stuff.
{{Cmd|emerge --search "%@^app-vim"}}
{{Cmd|eix -C app-vim}}

== Getting started ==
Vim has a built-in tutorial which should require around 30 min to go trough. Start it using command:
{{Cmd|vimtutor}}

== Modes ==
Vim has 3 modes:
* Command mode: Keystrokes are interpreted as commands
* Insert mode: Keystrokes are interpreted as text (except a few special commands)
* Visual mode: Visual mode supports you by selecting some text. It behaves a lot like command mode
