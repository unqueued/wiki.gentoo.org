'''Vim''' ('''V'''i '''im'''proved) is a text editor based on [[Wikipedia:Vi|vi]]. It can be used from the command line or as a standalone application with graphical user interface.

== Installation ==

=== Application installation ===

To install Vim with both the ncurses-based interface (for the terminal - {{Path|/usr/bin/vim</code>}}) and the graphical interface (for the X Window System - {{Path|/usr/bin/gvim}}), install {{Package|app-editors/gvim}}:

{{Emerge|app-editors/gvim}}

There is also an experimental [[Qt]] interface called {{Package|app-editors/vim-qt}}.

If the X Window System support is not needed, just install {{Package|app-editors/vim}}:

{{Emerge|app-editors/vim}}

=== Extensions ===

The category ''app-vim'' provides a lot of additional syntax definitions, plugins and other Vim related stuff.

Use <code>emerge</code> or <code>eix</code> to get an overview of available packages in the ''app-vim'' category:

{{Cmd|emerge --search "%@^app-vim"
|eix -cC app-vim}}

== Using Vim ==

=== Getting started ===

Vim has a built-in tutorial which should require around 30 min to go through. Start it using the <code>vimtutor</code> command:

{{Cmd|vimtutor}}

=== Modes ===

Vim has 3 modes:
* Command mode: Keystrokes are interpreted as commands
* Insert mode: Keystrokes are interpreted as text (except a few special commands)
* Visual mode: Visual mode supports you by selecting some text. It behaves a lot like command mode

== Tips and Tricks ==

=== Using Vim like ex or ed from the command line ===

Add '#' to begin of each line of file.txt:
{{Cmd|vim -c ":%s/^/#/g" -c ":x" file.txt}}

From vim command mode:
{{Cmd|%s/^/#/g|prompt=:|color=blue}}

=== Change file encoding ===

Change encoding of file to UTF-8:
{{Cmd|vim -c ":wq! ++enc{{=}}utf8" file.txt}}

Reload file in UTF-8 from vim command mode:
{{Cmd|e ++enc{{=}}utf8|prompt=:|color=blue}}
