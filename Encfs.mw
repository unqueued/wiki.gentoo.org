'''encfs''' is a simple userspace encryption method that is very simple, and not very secure.  It's good enough to keep the random passerby out.

== Installation ==
=== Kernel ===
{{Kernel|Enable FUSE|<pre>
File systems  --->
    [*] FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support
</pre>}}

=== Useflags ===
{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/encfs
|xattr
}}

=== Emerge ===
Install {{Package|sys-fs/encfs}}:
{{Emerge|sys-fs/encfs}}

== Configuration ==
=== Deployment ===
Encfs makes a hidden directory to store encrypted data, then fuse to mount a decrypted directory.
{{note|make sure ~/encfs is empty or you will get non empty mount point error messages}}
{{Cmd|encfs ~/.encfs ~/encfs}}

After running the command setup will ask you if .encfs should be made, type Y and hit enter.
another question will come up regarding setting up encryption scheme etc.  press enter to accept defaults.

Enter the password to the prompt twice and you're done.  You're ready to feed to be encrypted files to ~/encfs

=== Locking ===
To unmount the fuse decrypted directory:
{{Cmd|fusermount -u ~/encfs}}

=== Unlocking ===
To mount the decrypted fuse directory:
{{Cmd|encfs ~/.encfs ~/encfs}}

== Examples ==
mkultra@spaceball-1 ~ $ ls encfs/<br />
foo  bar<br />
mkultra@spaceball-1 ~ $ ls .encfs/<br />
