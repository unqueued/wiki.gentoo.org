LXD is the Linux Containers Daemon, and the successor to LXC.  Though both are developed concurrently by St√©phane Graber (and Canonical), LXD is still under active development and is currently suitable for evaluation use only.

If you are new to container technology, it would be good to first read the "Virtualization Concepts" section of the [[LXC]] page.

Key features of LXD include:
* prefers to launch unprivileged containers (secure by default)
* A command-line client (lxc) interacts with a daemon (lxd).
* Configuration is made easier through cascading profiles.
* Configuration changes are performed with the lxc command (no more config files).
* Multiple hosts can be federated together (with a certificate-based trust system).
* A federated setup means that containers can be launched on remote machines and live-migrated between hosts (using CRIU technology).
