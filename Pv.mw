'''pv''' is a tool to view verbose information about data streamed/piped ''through'' it. The data can be of any source like files, block devices, network streams etc. It shows the amount of data passed through, time running, progress bar, percentage and the estimated completion time.

== Installation ==

You can install {{Package|sys-apps/pv}} using the following command:
{{Emerge|sys-apps/pv}}

== Usage ==

{{c|pv}} is mostly used with other programs which lack the ability to monitor the progress.

=== Copy files ===

The easiest way to use {{c|pv}} is by using a file as the input stream and direct the output stream into another file.
{{Cmd|pv /etc/portage/make.conf > ~/make.conf}}
This is the same as (per default all output is turned on):
{{Cmd|pv -p -t -e -r -b /etc/portage/make.conf > ~/make.conf}}
<code>-p</code>: Display a progress bar.
<br />
<code>-t</code>: Display the total elapsed time.
<br />
<code>-e</code>: Estimate the completion time.
<br />
<code>-r</code>: Display the current transfer rate.
<br />
<code>-b</code>: Display the total bytes transferred.

=== Pipe input ===

The estimated completion time and progress bar can only be displayed if {{c|pv}} knows the total size of the input stream. For example if we use {{c|cat}} to produce the input stream and pipe it to {{c|pv}}:
{{Cmd|cat /etc/portage/make.conf {{!}} pv -p -t -e -r -b > ~/make.conf}}
The size can be given to {{c|pv}} to estimate the time, in this example 1 kB:
{{Cmd|cat /etc/portage/make.conf {{!}} pv -s1k > ~/make.conf}}
Just pipe the data through {{c|pv}} and use it in a different program in the end. In this example we see how fast we can download the <code>index.html</code> from <code>www.gentoo.org</code> using {{c|curl}} and count the number of words in it:
{{Cmd|curl www.gentoo.org {{!}} pv {{!}} wc -w}}
Or have more verbose output using [[dd]]:
{{Cmd|dd if{{=}}/mnt/mylargefile.img {{!}} pv {{!}} dd of{{=}}~/mycopy.img}}
