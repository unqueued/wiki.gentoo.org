Duperemove is [[Article description::a [[btrfs]] tool for finding duplicated extents and submitting them to the kernel for deduplication]].

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|sys-fs/duperemove}}

== Usage ==

Detailed information can be seen by running {{c|man duperemove}}.

=== Invocation ===

{{RootInvocation|duperemove --help|output=<pre>
duperemove v0.11
Find duplicate extents and optionally dedupe them.

Basic usage: duperemove [-r] [-d] [-h] [-v] [-A] [--hashfile=hashfile] OBJECTS

"OBJECTS" is a list of files (or directories) which we
want to find duplicate extents in. If a directory is 
specified, all regular files inside of it will be scanned.

	<switches>
	-r		Enable recursive dir traversal.
	-d		De-dupe the results (must run on a supported fs).
	--hashfile=FILE	Store hashes in this file.
	-A		Open files for dedupe in read-only mode.
	-h		Print numbers in human-readable format.
	-v		Print extra information (verbose).
	--help		Prints this help text.


Please see the duperemove(8) manpage for a complete list of options.
</pre>}}

The following command shows how to deduplicate the {{Path|/home}} filesystem; the hash file will be stored under the {{Path|/root}} directory:

{{RootCmd|duperemove -rdh --hashfile{{=}}/root/home.hash /home}}

{{Note|The previous command may be interrupted at any time with {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|c}} and resumed later without risk of corrupting any data.}}

=== Reading a file list created with fdupes ===

By passing the <code>--fdupes</code> option, {{c|duperemove}} can work in conjunction with {{c|[[fdupes]]}} in order to deduplicate a pre-calculated list of files. When in this mode, input will be accepted on stdin:

{{RootCmd|cat fdupes_list.txt {{!!}} duperemove --fdupes}}

This is handy when a list of duplicates has already been created so that disk-intensive deduplication job can be ran at a time when the system is not under heavy load.

It is also possible to deduplicate directly from fdupes (without creating a file list):

{{RootCmd|fdupes -r -S /path/to/filesystem/directory {{!!}} duperemove --fdupes}}
