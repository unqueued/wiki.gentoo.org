=== Invocation ===

{{RootCmd|./duperemove --help|output=<pre>
duperemove v0.11-dev
Find duplicate extents and print them to stdout

Usage: ./duperemove [-r] [-d] [-h] [--debug] [--hashfile=hashfile] OBJECTS

"OBJECTS" is a list of files (or directories) which we
want to find duplicate extents in. If a directory is
specified, all regular files inside of it will be scanned.

        <switches>
        -r              Enable recursive dir traversal.
        -d              De-dupe the results - only works on btrfs.
        -h              Print numbers in human-readable format.
        --hashfile=FILE Use a file instead of memory for storing hashes.
        --help          Prints this help text.

Please see the duperemove(8) manpage for more options.
