Duperemove is a [[btrfs]] tool for finding duplicated extents and submitting them to the kernel for deduplication.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|sys-fs/duperemove}}

== Usage ==

Detailed information can be seen by running {{c|man duperemove}}.

=== Invocation ===

{{RootInvocation|duperemove --help|output=<pre>
duperemove v0.11-dev
Find duplicate extents and print them to stdout

Usage: ./duperemove [-r] [-d] [-h] [--debug] [--hashfile=hashfile] OBJECTS

"OBJECTS" is a list of files (or directories) which we
want to find duplicate extents in. If a directory is
specified, all regular files inside of it will be scanned.

        <switches>
        -r              Enable recursive dir traversal.
        -d              De-dupe the results - only works on btrfs.
        -h              Print numbers in human-readable format.
        --hashfile=FILE Use a file instead of memory for storing hashes.
        --help          Prints this help text.

Please see the duperemove(8) manpage for more options.

=== Reading a file list created with fdupes ===

By passing the <code>--fdups</code> option, {{c|duperemove}} can work in conjunction with {{c|[[fdupes]]}} in order to deduplicate a pre-calculated list of files. When in this mode, input will be accepted on stdin:

{{RootCmd|cat fdupes_list.txt {{!!}} duperemove --fdupes}}

This is handy when a list of duplicates has already been created so that disk-intensive deduplication job can be ran at a time when the system is not under heavy load.

It is also possible to deduplicate directly from fdupes (without creating a file list):

{{RootCmd|fdupes -r -S /path/to/filesystem/directory {{!!}} duperemove --fdupes}}
