The Ceph monitor provides the entry towards the Ceph cluster for any operations on the cluster. Clients connect to monitor servers to obtain the CRUSH map (to know how the distribution of objects should be done), and whenever cluster management operations occur a majority of monitor servers need to acknowledge the operation. If not, then the operation is unsuccessful.
