This article is [[Article description::used to list deprecated (or simply no longer existent) locations for upstream package repositories.]] At one time Gentoo ebuild maintainers were able to download source tarballs for packages from these sites. Now that they are no longer usable, ebuild maintainers have the difficult job up tracking down where the upstream projects have decided to move their project repositories.

This generates a lot of maintenance fixing <var>SRC_URI</var> values in the main Gentoo repository.

== Security ==

Many projects got forked several times during the shut down procedure and it is not always easy to find out which fork is the right one for the Gentoo ebuild.

While many packages need an update to a new URL it is easy to plant silently a link to malicious source code instead of the original source code. It is also possible that a Gentoo developer uses a wrong fork by accident.

== Fixing a package ==

* If there is no suitable upstream <var>HOMEPAGE</var> use <code><nowiki>https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/No_homepage</nowiki></code> as a substitute.

== Notable repositories that were shut down ==
