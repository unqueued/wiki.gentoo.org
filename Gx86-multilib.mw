The gx86-multilib project aims to provide means to build Gentoo packages for multiple ABIs ([[multilib]]) and oversee the establishment of packages supporting that feature in Gentoo.

== Goals ==

The main goal is to provide a feasible and user-friendly way of supporting applications which are not compatible with the native ABI. This mostly targets closed-source applications (such as Skype) which are not released for the native ABI/arch, applications interfacing those (such as wine) and — in specific cases — applications which are broken when compiled for the native ABI.

A side goal is to deprecate and remove the emul-linux packages, replacing them with a better solution.

== The eclasses ==

The following eclasses are provided for multilib-related use:

* [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/eclass-reference/multilib-build.eclass/ multilib-build.eclass]
* [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/eclass-reference/autotools-multilib.eclass/ autotools-multilib.eclass]
* [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/eclass-reference/multilib-minimal.eclass/ multilib-minimal.eclass]
