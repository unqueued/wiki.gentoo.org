The mission of Gentoo's gx86-multilib project is two-foldː
# Provide a means to build Gentoo packages for multiple ABIs ([[multilib]]); and 
# Empower package maintainers to implement multiple ABIs in a consistent manner.

== Goals ==
Our main goal is to provide a feasible and user-friendly way of supporting applications which are not compatible with the native ABI. This means, we effectively target the following three kinds of applicationsː
# Closed-source applications, such as Skype, which are not released for the native ABI or architecture;
# Applications interfacing with closed source applications, such as wine ;and
# Applications which break when compiled for the native ABI.

A side goal is to deprecate and remove the emul-linux packages, replacing them with a better solution.

== Eclasses ==
We provide the following eclasses for multilib-related use:

# [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/eclass-reference/multilib-build.eclass/ multilib-build.eclass] provides the raw tools to build packages with multilib support. It sets the necessary USE flags for the package and provides functions to perform the build. It should be used only in meta-packages, as it exclusively affects USE flags.
# [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/eclass-reference/autotools-multilib.eclass/ autotools-multilib.eclass] is a very simple wrapper on top of the ''autotools-utils.eclass''. It should be used for all multilib-capable autotools packages. It uses the out-of-source build feature to support multilib builds with almost no need of modifying autotools-utils ebuilds.
# [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/eclass-reference/multilib-minimal.eclass/ multilib-minimal.eclass] provides a simple, wrapper to build the packages where no other eclass fits better.

== USE flags ==

Multilib-capable packages have a set of ''abi_*'' USE flags that are used to request proper package variants and satisfy dependencies. To satisfy the requirement on immutability of USE flags, flags for all architectures are always defined in packages.

By default, all ''abi_*'' flags are masked and hidden. Profiles specific to the particular architecture unmask the flags and force the native flag (it is still hidden from user). Multilib profiles additionally un-hide the flags and unmask additional variants.

It is important that the native ABI flag is always enabled (forced) on the multilib libraries. This guarantees that plain (non-multilib aware) package dependencies always pull in the native variant. It is both for backwards compatibility and convenience, in order to make the multilib support transparent to non-multilib packages.

It may be desired to remove the forced flags on some leaf packages like {{Package|app-emulation/wine}} or {{Package|www-plugins/adobe-flash}}. This can be done via profile package.use.force file. However, please note that afterwards non-multilib packages won't be able to properly depend on the package in question.
