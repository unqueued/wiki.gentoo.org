This article describes the removal of old [[Special:MyLanguage/Kernel|kernels]].

== Removing kernel sources ==

After you installed a new kernel and if it works satisfying, you can remove the old kernel. To remove the old kernel sources, [[Special:MyLanguage/emerge|emerge]] has the option ''--prune'' (short form ''-P''), to remove all versions of a package except the newest version, e.g. for {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}:
{{RootCmd|emerge --prune gentoo-sources}}

== Remove kernel leftovers ==

In addition to the kernel sources there are more leftovers in the system, you can now remove:

* When you build a kernel in the kernel folder, generated temp files of the build process are even after the removing of the kernel sources still there:
: {{RootCmd|rm -r /usr/src/linux-2.6.XY}}

* During kernel setup the kernel modules are copied to a sub folder of <tt>/lib/modules/</tt>. You can delete them now:
: {{RootCmd|rm -r /lib/modules/2.6.XY}}

* During kernel setup the kernel and potentially the <tt>System.map</tt> and the kernel config file were copied to <tt>/boot</tt>. You delete them now:
: {{RootCmd|rm /boot/kernel-2.6.XY|rm /boot/System.map-2.6.XY|rm /boot/config-2.6.XY}}

* You can remove all leftover entries in the config file of your bootloader.
