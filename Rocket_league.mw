==Preface==
This guide is exactly what I had to do to make Rocket League work for me. I do know that there are different ways to get this game working because of [https://www.reddit.com/r/Gentoo/comments/4z7zek/rocket_league_on_gentoo/ this thread]

I am running kernel 4.7.2 and the default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop profile. I have an i7 2600k processor and an Nvidia GTX 980 video card using nvidia-drivers-370.23.

==Install PlayOnLinux==
# As root, run the command: <code>echo "app-emulation/playonlinux ~amd64" > /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/playonlinux</code>
# Emerge playonlinux: <code>emerge playonlinux</code>

==Install Steam within PlayOnLinux==
# Open PlayOnLinux
# Click Install
# Search for Steam, highlight Steam, and click install
# Follow all directions to complete the installation of Steam
# After Steam has been installed you should see the icon in the main PlayOnLinux window. Highlight this icon and click "Configure"
# I like to update to the newest Wine version as PlayOnLinux will install an older version, but you can skip this if you want to
##Click the plus button next to"Wine version". 
##Under "Available Wine versions:" highlight the newest staging version of Wine and click the greater than arrow (&gt;) to install it. I am using 1.9.17-staging. 
##Now that this version is actually installed, be sure to select this new version from the dropdown next to "Wine version". 
# Click on the "Install components tab"
# Install the following:
## directx9
## d3dx9_43
## vcrun2008
## vcrun2010
## vcrun2012
# Click the "Display" tab
# Set the "Video memory size" correctly depending on your video card. I set mine to 4096.

==Final Tweaks==
At this point you may wish to test Rocket League to see if it will open for you. It did not for me. Based on a post on [https://www.gamersonlinux.com/forum/threads/rocket-league-guide.1543/ this page] you need the following 32 bit libraries: lib32-gnutls, lib32-alsa-lib, lib32-alsa-plugins, lib32-libxml2, and lib32-libldap. I personally don't have 32 bit alsa-plugins and it works fine for my system but I do have everything else. To mirror my setup, run the following command as root:
* <code>echo -e "net-libs/gnutls abi_x86_32 pkcs11\nmedia-libs/alsa-lib abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/libxml2 abi_x86_32\nnet-nds/openldap abi_x86_32" > /etc/portage/package.use/rocketleague </code>
** Note - I needed to add the pkcs11 use flag to gnutls because otherwise I was unable to play online - Rocket League wouldn't find any servers. Feel free to test on your own system.
