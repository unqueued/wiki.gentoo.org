{{warning| Rocket League [https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/09/rocket-league-linux-download-rumble-update-september was relased 8th September 2016 on linux] meaning that it works natively using steam }}

==Preface==
This guide is exactly what I had to do to make Rocket League work for me. I do know that there are different ways to get this game working because of [https://www.reddit.com/r/Gentoo/comments/4z7zek/rocket_league_on_gentoo/ this thread]

I am running kernel 4.7.2 and the default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop profile. I have an i7 2600k processor and an Nvidia GTX 980 video card using nvidia-drivers-370.23.

==Install PlayOnLinux==
# As root, run the command: <code>echo "app-emulation/playonlinux ~amd64" > /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/playonlinux</code>
# Emerge playonlinux: <code>emerge playonlinux</code>

==Install Steam within PlayOnLinux==
# Open PlayOnLinux
# Click Install
# Search for Steam, highlight Steam, and click install
# Follow all directions to complete the installation of Steam
# After Steam has been installed you should see the icon in the main PlayOnLinux window. Highlight this icon and click "Configure"
# I like to update to the newest Wine version as PlayOnLinux will install an older version, but you can skip this if you want to
##Click the plus button next to"Wine version". 
##Under "Available Wine versions:" highlight the newest staging version of Wine and click the greater than arrow (&gt;) to install it. I am using 1.9.17-staging. 
##Now that this version is actually installed, be sure to select this new version from the dropdown next to "Wine version". 
# Click on the "Install components tab"
# Install the following:
## directx9
## d3dx9_43
## vcrun2008
## vcrun2010
## vcrun2012
# Click the "Display" tab
# Set the "Video memory size" correctly depending on your video card. I set mine to 4096.

==Final Tweaks==
At this point you may wish to test Rocket League to see if it will open for you. It did not for me. Based on a post on [https://www.gamersonlinux.com/forum/threads/rocket-league-guide.1543/ this page] you need the following 32 bit libraries: lib32-gnutls, lib32-alsa-lib, lib32-alsa-plugins, lib32-libxml2, and lib32-libldap. I personally don't have 32 bit alsa-plugins and it works fine for my system but I do have everything else. To mirror my setup, run the following command as root:
* <code>echo -e "net-libs/gnutls abi_x86_32 pkcs11\nmedia-libs/alsa-lib abi_x86_32\ndev-libs/libxml2 abi_x86_32\nnet-nds/openldap abi_x86_32" > /etc/portage/package.use/rocketleague </code>
** Note - I needed to add the pkcs11 use flag to gnutls because otherwise I was unable to play online - Rocket League wouldn't find any servers. Feel free to test on your own system.

Also, be sure to add your user to the "input" group! This is necessary to use controllers. Run the command <code>sudo usermod -a -G input username</code> replacing "username" with your actual username.
