Quassel Core is a daemon/headless IRC client, part of Quassel, that supports 24/7 connectivity. Quassel Client can be attached to it to.

== Installation ==

To install:
{{Emerge|net-irc/quassel}}

Create an SSL/TLS certificate:
{{RootCmd|( cd /var/lib/quassel/ && openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout quasselCert.key -out quasselCert.crt && cat quasselCert.{key,crt} > quasselCert.pem )}}

To start quasselcore on start-up:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add quasselcore default}}

Start Quassel Core:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/quasselcore start}}

Connect to the core with your Quassel Client, and the client will prompt you for initial setup configuration, including database credentials.

==Configuration==

At times, one may need to change Quassel's behavior, such as its default listening address, default port, etc.

To change the default port from the CLI:
{{RootCmd |<nowiki>quasselcore --configdir=/var/lib/quassel --port=4141</nowiki>}}

Other options can be displayed with:
{{RootCmd |quasselcore --help}}

====OpenRC====
Gentoo's Quassel package should come with a useful and fairly self-explanatory file to adjust Quassel's default behavior in OpenRC in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/quasselcore}}.

====Systemd====
Systemd's variables will need to be set in {{Path|/usr/lib64/systemd/system/quasselcore.service}}.  Options will be the same as those used when running Quassel from the CLI and will need to be added to <code>ExecStart=</code>.

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/lib64/systemd/system/quasselcore.service|title=Example of a default port change|lang=ini|1=
[Unit]
Description=Quassel Core
After=network.target

[Service]
User=quassel
Group=quassel
ExecStart=/usr/bin/quasselcore --configdir=/var/lib/quassel --port=4141

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
}}

=== Migrate SQLite to PostgreSQL ===

Create users in PostgreSQL for Quassel, here we use a user and database called "quassel". See [[PostgreSQL/QuickStart]] for information on how to do this.

Then setup Quassel with the user you created:

{{RootCmd|<nowiki>quasselcore --configdir=/var/lib/quassel --select-backend=PostgreSQL</nowiki>}}
