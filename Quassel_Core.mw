=== Migrate SQLite to PostgreSQL ===

Create users in PostgreSQL for Quassel, here we use a user and database called "quassel". See [[PostgreSQL/QuickStart]] for information on how to do this.

Then setup Quassel with the user you created:

{{RootCmd|<nowiki>quasselcore --configdir=/var/lib/quassel --select-backend=PostgreSQL</nowiki>}}
