== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

To install:

{{Emerge|net-irc/quassel}}

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

==== OpenRC ====

Gentoo's Quassel package should come with a useful and fairly self-explanatory file to adjust Quassel's default behavior for OpenRC in the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/quasselcore}} configuration file.

==== Systemd ====

Systemd's variables will need to be set in the {{Path|/usr/lib64/systemd/system/quasselcore.service}} file. Options will be the same as those used when running Quassel from the CLI and will need to be added to <code>ExecStart=</code>.

{{FileBox|filename=/lib64/systemd/system/quasselcore.service|title=Example of a default port change|lang=ini|1=
[Unit]
Description=Quassel Core
After=network.target

[Service]
User=quassel
Group=quassel
ExecStart=/usr/bin/quasselcore --configdir=/var/lib/quassel --port=4141

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
}}

=== SSL/TLS certificate generation ===

Create an SSL/TLS certificate:

{{RootCmd|( cd /var/lib/quassel/ && openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout quasselCert.key -out quasselCert.crt && cat quasselCert.{key,crt} > quasselCert.pem )}}

=== Services ===

To start Quassel Core on start-up:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add quasselcore default}}

Start Quassel Core:

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/quasselcore start}}

Connect to the core with a Quassel Client, and the client will prompt for initial setup configuration, including database credentials.
At times it may be necessary to change Quassel's behavior, such as its default listening address, default port, etc.

To change the default port from the CLI:

{{RootCmd |<nowiki>quasselcore --configdir=/var/lib/quassel --port=4141</nowiki>}}

Other options can be displayed with:

{{RootCmd |quasselcore --help}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Migrate SQLite to PostgreSQL ===

Create users in PostgreSQL for Quassel, here we use a user and database called "quassel". See [[PostgreSQL/QuickStart]] for information on how to do this.

Then setup Quassel with the user you created:

{{RootCmd|<nowiki>quasselcore --configdir=/var/lib/quassel --select-backend=PostgreSQL</nowiki>}}
