For each file in {{Path|/etc/portage/sets}}, a package [[set]] is created, defining a one-to-many relationship between a set name and an arbitrary group of package atoms.  User-defined set names correspond to the name of the file.  Each file should contain a list of package atoms and nested package sets, one per line.  You can see the full list of sets that exist at any time with
{{Cmd|emerge --list-sets}}

==Example==
Say you were running live ebuilds for your GPU drivers, and wanted an easy shorthand for rebuilding them on demand.  Define this set:
{{File|/etc/portage/sets/gpu-stack||<pre>
x11-libs/libdrm
media-libs/mesa
x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati
x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel
</pre>}}

Now, all you need to do to trigger a rebuild of all of them at once is 
{{RootCmd|emerge --ask @gpu-stack|output=<pre>
These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

{{Note|Selecting "Yes" here will add the set to your {{Path|/var/lib/portage/world_sets}}.  Use --oneshot if you'd like to avoid this.}}
