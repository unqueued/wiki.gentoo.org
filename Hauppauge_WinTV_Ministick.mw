== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need [[USB]] support, if you have an USB input device. Also you need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Input device support  --->
        <*>   Event interface

        If a mouse is connected to a PS/2 port:
        [*]   Mice  --->
              <*>   PS/2 mouse

       If a keyboard is connected to a PS/2 port:
        -*-   Keyboards  --->
              <*>   AT keyboard

    If an input device is connected to an USB port:
    [*] HID Devices  --->
        -*-   Generic HID support
        <*>   USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support
</pre>}}
