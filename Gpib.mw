  gpasswd -a user gpib

===== Configuring linux-gpib =====

To configure Linux GPIB you need first to create a config file at ''/etc/gpib.conf''
  vim /etc/gpib.conf

Just an example which is for NI USB- HS Adapter is:

  interface {
        minor = 0
        board_type = "ni_usb_b"
        name = "joe"
        pad = 0
        master = yes
  }
