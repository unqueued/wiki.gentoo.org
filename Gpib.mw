====== Linux Gpib Howto in Gentoo ======

===== Installing linux-gpib  =====

First set use flags in /etc/portage/package.use
  sudo vim /etc/portage/package.use

add line for python bindings and Documentation
  sci-libs/linux-gpib python doc
Other possible Flags ''pcmcia static debug guile perl php tcl firmware''
If you want to use ''pcmia'' you need to have a 2.7 kernel. But ''pcmia '' is normally just used in old computers so it doesn't matter.

===== Configuring linux-gpib =====

To configure Linux GPIB you need first to create a config file at ''/etc/gpib.conf''
  vim /etc/gpib.conf

Just an example which is for NI USB- HS Adapter is:

  interface {
        minor = 0
        board_type = "ni_usb_b"
        name = "joe"
        pad = 0
        master = yes
  }


You can lookup the board_type at [http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/doc_html/x259.html Linux-gpib-Website]
