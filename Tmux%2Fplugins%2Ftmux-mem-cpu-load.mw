__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

There are currently no USE flags for this program.

=== Emerge ===

For user convenience the package has been included in official Gentoo repositories:

{{Emerge|{{Package|app-misc/tmux-mem-cpu-load}}}}

== Configuration ==

=== tmux integration ===

For proper integration, {{c|tmux}}'s configuration file will need to be modified to include references to {{c|tmux-mem-cpu-load}}. If a configuration file does not exist, which is the default for new {{c|tmux}} installs, the main article has information [[Tmux#Package_examples|on how to obtain one]].

Once the configuration file has been set add {{c|tmux-mem-cpu-load}} references. The following example will use a configuration file based on [[Tmux#Wiki_example|the Wiki's example]] that has been copied to a user's home directory using the following command:

{{Cmd|bzcat /usr/share/doc/tmux-2.0/examples/h-boetes.conf.bz2 > ~/.tmux.conf}}

{{FileBox|filename=~/.tmux.conf|title=Adding tmux-mem-cpu-load references|1=
set -g status-interval 2
set -g status-left "#S #[fg=green,bg=black]#(tmux-mem-cpu-load 2)#[default]"
set -g status-left-length 60
}}

== Usage ==

{{Cmd|tmux-mem-cpu-load -h|output=<pre>
Usage: tmux-mem-cpu-load [tmux_status-interval(seconds)] [graph lines]
</pre>}}

{{c|tmux-mem-cpu-load}} can be called independently for stand-alone operation or for use as a system status monitor in other programs. In order for the monitor to persist in the terminal, call it using the {{c|watch}} utility:

{{Cmd|watch tmux-mem-cpu-load}}
