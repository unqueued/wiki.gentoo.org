|Tags support for Portage|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Gentoo uses categories now. A package can only be in a single category, which is very limiting because generally things don't fit perfectly into one place without other possibilities. Tags could make it a lot easier to find packages they're looking for by doing Boolean searches like: kde AND mail. This project would add support for tags to Portage and would allow for backwards compatibility of categories as tags.

{{Note|This project in its current form is considered trivial and not suitable for a complete SoC project [http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-soc/msg_f082a4346ffc9578948ce2f987a80465.xml]. If you wish to work on this, you should expand the scope of the work significantly.  One possibility is to include the Portage public API project already partially completed.}}
