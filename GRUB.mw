{{Stub}}
'''GRUB''' (GRand Unified Bootloader) is the default [[bootloader]] on Gentoo. This article discusses <code>sys-boot/grub:0</code> (slot zero) also known as "Grub Legacy". Version 2, now available in the testing tree, is completely reworked and fundamentally a different bootloader â€” see [[GRUB2]].

==Installation==
Install grub with:
{{Emerge|sys-boot/grub:0}}
Specifying slot 0 will make sure grub:2 will not get installed on world updates, unless you specifically install it.

=== USE flags ===
{{USEflag|package=sys-boot/grub
|custom-cflags++no+
|ncurses+yes+yes+
|netboot
|static
}}
