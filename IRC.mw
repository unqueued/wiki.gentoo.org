Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is one of the primary avenues of communication for those involved at all levels with the Gentoo project. Since chat messages are sent and received almost instantly using IRC can quicken collaboration processes. IRC is well suited for user support, but should only be relied upon when clear answers cannot be found by using a search engine or on the Wiki. In the Gentoo project, many of the sub-projects use the Freenode network to host project related channels. These channels are used for tracking changes, discussing features, planning and meetings, support, and interpersonal communication. 

Channels associated with the Gentoo project have a [[Project:Council/Code of conduct|code of conduct that should be reviewed by each user]] before connecting. Navigate [https://www.gentoo.org/get-involved/irc-channels/all-channels.html here] to view a list of Gentoo related channels on Freenode.

{{Important|It is important to understand Gentoo IRC channels are not encrypted; all discussion therein is entirely visible to the public. Discussion is plain text and is most likely logged by every user present in the channel. It is unwise to post private information inside IRC channels.}}
