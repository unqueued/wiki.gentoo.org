Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is one of the primary avenues of communication for those involved at all levels in the [[Project:Gentoo|Gentoo project]]. Since chat messages are sent and received almost instantly, using IRC quickens collaboration processes by providing a real-time environment for communication. IRC is also well suited for user support, but should only be relied upon when clear answers cannot be found by using a search engine, on the [https://forums.gentoo.org/ Forums], [https://www.gentoo.org/get-involved/mailing-lists/all-lists.html mailing lists], or here on the Wiki. Most Gentoo subprojects have specific channel on Freenode for inter-project communication. Project related channels are used for: tracking changes to source code, requested and discussing (new) features, addressing various issues, real-time team meetings, internal support, and communication between Gentoo developers and the community.

Channels associated with the Gentoo project have a [[Project:Council/Code_of_conduct#Behavior_and_Consequences|code of conduct]] that should be reviewed by each user before connecting to any channel. Navigate [https://www.gentoo.org/get-involved/irc-channels/all-channels.html here] to view a list of official Gentoo-related channels on Freenode.

{{Important|It is important to understand Gentoo IRC channels, like the mailing lists, are <u>''not''</u> encrypted; all discussion therein is entirely visible to the public in plain text and is most likely logged by every user present in the channel. It is unwise and unsafe to post private information inside IRC channels.}}

== Usage ==

For many who are used to messaging through a web browser (Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, etc.) or game client ([[Steam]], League of Legends, Blizzard, etc) using a program designed specifically for chatting may seem odd. Learning can be especially challenging when attempting to use a text-mode (CLI) client like [[Irssi]] or [[WeeChat]]. IRC can be tricky to learn because there are many associated, sometimes entirely new, concepts that should be covered in order to prepare users to communicate effectively. For this reason the [[IRC/Guide|IRC guide]] has been written. Head over there for in-depth information on many IRC related topics. Also see the [[#External resources|External resources]] section below.
