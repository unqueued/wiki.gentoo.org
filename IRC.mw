Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is one of the primary avenues of communication for those involved at all levels in the [[Project:Gentoo|Gentoo project]]. Since chat messages are sent and received almost instantly, using IRC quickens collaboration processes by providing a real-time environment for communication. IRC is also well suited for user support, but should only be relied upon when clear answers cannot be found by using a search engine, on the [https://forums.gentoo.org/ forums], [https://www.gentoo.org/get-involved/mailing-lists/all-lists.html mailing lists], or here on the wiki. Most Gentoo subprojects have specific channel on Freenode for inter-project communication. Project related channels are used for: tracking changes to source code, requesting and discussing (new) features, addressing various issues, real-time team meetings, internal support, and communication between Gentoo developers and the community.

The [https://www.gentoo.org/get-involved/irc-channels/all-channels.html Gentoo IRC channels on Freenode] have a [[Project:Council/Code_of_conduct#Behavior_and_Consequences|code of conduct]] that should be reviewed by each user before connecting to any channel.

{{Important|It is important to understand Gentoo IRC channels, like the mailing lists, are <u>''not''</u> encrypted; all discussion therein is entirely visible to the public in plain text and is most likely logged by every user present in the channel. It is unwise and unsafe to post private information inside IRC channels.}}

=== Spam protection ===
In order to prevent '''private message spam''' on IRC from unregistered users, one can set '''user modes''' '''+g''' or '''+R'''.

Alice wants to ignore private messages from users who are not identified, but wants to get an information that someone wanted to send a message to Alice. Alice can decide to receive messages with the /accept command:
  /mode alice +g 

Alice wants to ignore private messages from users who are not identified totally:

  /mode alice +R
