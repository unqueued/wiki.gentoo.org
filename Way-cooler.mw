{{warning|way-cooler is currently '''under heavy development!'''}}

{{warning|The result of the installation steps will give you a binary, called ''way-cooler'' '''which does not work''' on Gentoo somehow. These steps have to be reworked.}}

"'''Way Cooler''' is the spiritual successor of [https://awesomewm.org/ AwesomeWM] for [https://wayland.freedesktop.org/ Wayland]. It is a customizable Wayland compositor (window manager) which uses [https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots wlroots]. Way Cooler is written in [https://www.rust-lang.org/ Rust] and C."

=== Profile ===

Choose the appropiate desktop profile to set a number of global and package-specific USE flags:
{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|output=<pre>

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set 16}}

The selection will be indicated by an asterisk (*):

== Installation ==

Currently there is neither an official Gentoo package nor an overlay package of ''way-cooler'' available. Therefore the "build from source" method will be used which is stated on the [https://crates.io/crates/way-cooler#build-from-source way-cooler's crates.io page].

{{USEflag|package=gui-wm/way-cooler|desc=}}

First of all install ''Wayland'' which represents the base. Add the USE flags <code>wayland</code> and <code>-X</code> to ''/etc/portage/make.conf'':

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Enable classic tree view|lang=bash|1=
kde-plasma/systemsettings classic
}}

    1. add the use flags "wayland" and "-X" to "/etc/portage/make.conf"

        USE="wayland -X"

    2. install "dev-libs/wayland"

        $ emerge --ask dev-libs/wayland

            These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

            Calculating dependencies... done!
            [ebuild  N     ] dev-libs/wayland-1.16.0  USE="-doc -static-libs"

            Would you like to merge these packages? [Yes/No]
