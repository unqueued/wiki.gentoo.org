== Fix My Gentoo ==
=== Preamble ===
==== Introduction ====
This guide is something I've posted on the forums several times in response to users posting about nothing works.
If your gcc is broken after a --depclean, this guide is not for you. You almost certainly need gcc-conf. Be more careful in future.

This guide is for rescuing your install when you can't chroot in, almost nothing seems to work but you have determined that you need some binary packages to fix your system.

Its actually very difficult to break Gentoo so badly, it can't be fixed.

==== Overview ====
You need some binary packages to fix your Gentoo.  You might find them on a BINHOST or tinderbox on the web but they are unlikely to be built for your system, with your USE and your CCFLAGS.  This guide shows you how to make your own binary packages to use to fix your own system.  You will not need another system, a spare partition or even another install.

==== Prerequsites ==== 

You need a working internet connection.
A way to boot your broken box, e.g. System Rescue CD.
About 20G of free space on your broken install. 5G may do, depending on what you need to build.

==== Summary ====
As the bootable install is not working and we need a working install to build binary packages, we need another install.
This install need not be bootable.  Its sufficient to be able to chroot into it and run emerge.
This rescue install will share some elements with the main install that is to be rescued.  It saves space and makes thing easier in the final steps.
