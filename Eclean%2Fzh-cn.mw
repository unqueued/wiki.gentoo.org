{{c|eclean}} 是一个清理仓库源文件和二进制包的工具。它是 {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} 包的一部分，并由 [[Project:Portage-Tools|Portage-Tools]] 项目维护。

== 安装 ==

=== Emerge ===

安装 {{c|eclean}}：

{{Emerge|app-portage/gentoolkit}}

{{Note/zh-cn|关于 {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}} 包中其他工具的信息请参看 [[Gentoolkit|Gentoolkit article]]。}}

== 使用 ==

By default, source files are located in the {{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles}} directory, while binary packages are located in the {{Path|/usr/portage/packages}} directory. The locations for each can be changed by altering the <var>[[DISTDIR]]</var> and the <var>PKGDIR</var> variables respectively in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. Both locations can grow quite big if not periodically cleaned; this is the reason {{c|eclean}} was created.

=== Invocation ===

使用 {{c|eclean --help}} 来查看全部的命令简介、参数列表和使用介绍：

{{Invocation|eclean --help|output=<pre>
Usage:
 eclean [global-option] ... <action> [action-option] ...
 eclean-dist [global-option, distfiles-option] ...
 eclean-pkg [global-option, packages-option] ...
 eclean(-dist,-pkg) [--help, --version]
 
Available global options:
 -C, --nocolor             - turn off colors on output
 -d, --deep                - only keep the minimum for a reinstallation
 -e, --exclude-file=<path> - path to the exclusion file
 -i, --interactive         - ask confirmation before deletions
 -n, --package-names       - protect all versions (when --deep
 -p, --pretend             - only display what would be cleaned
 -q, --quiet               - be as quiet as possible
 -t, --time-limit=<time>   - don't delete files modified since <time>
   <time> is a duration: "1y" is "one year", "2w" is "two weeks", etc.
   Units are: y (years), m (months), w (weeks), d (days) and h (hours).
 -h, --help                - display the help screen
 -V, --version             - display version info
 
Available actions:
 packages     - clean outdated binary packages from PKGDIR
 distfiles    - clean outdated packages sources files from DISTDIR
 
Available options for the packages action:
 NONE  :)
 
Available options for the distfiles action:
 -f, --fetch-restricted   - protect fetch-restricted files (when --deep)
 -s, --size-limit=<size>  - don't delete distfiles bigger than <size>
   <size> is a size specification: "10M" is "ten megabytes", "200K" is
   "two hundreds kilobytes", etc.  Units are: G, M, K and B.
 
More detailed instruction can be found in `man eclean`
</pre>}}

=== 清理 源文件 ===

通过 <code>distfiles</code> 参数清理源文件存放目录：

{{RootCmd|eclean distfiles}}

或者使用更简短的命令：

{{RootCmd|eclean-dist}}

=== 清理二进制文件 ===

使用下面的命令清理二进制包：

{{RootCmd|eclean packages}}

或者使用更简短的命令：

{{RootCmd|eclean-pkg}}

== Options ==

By default, source files and binary packages corresponding to any ebuild in the current repository will '''not''' be deleted. This way, system administrators can easily downgrade a package or install a previously removed package, provided the package is still in the current repository tree.

As an example, suppose packages foo-1.0 and foo-1.1 are both in the repository. After updating from foo-1.0 to foo-1.1, run {{c|eclean distfiles}}: source files for both versions will be kept, so if a problem occurs with foo-1.1 then the user can easily re-install foo-1.0 without re-downloading anything.

另一个可能的情况是安装之前删除的包。假设系统安装了 foo 包（任一版本）。在（不经意地）删除了这个包并运行了 {{c|eclean disfiles}} 之后，foo 的源文件依然被保留，可以重新安装而无需再次下载。

对二进制包同样的例子也一样适用。

To save more disk space, add the <code>--deep</code> option: every source file or binary package that does not correspond to some ''currently installed'' package (version does matter) will be deleted. Please notice that this way users will not be protected in case they need to downgrade a package or re-install a previously removed package.

As an alternative, use both the <code>--deep</code> and the <code>--package-names</code> options: every source file or binary package that does not correspond to some currently installed package (version does not matter) will be deleted. This still will not protect in case a re-install of a previously removed package is needed, but it will protect the sources if the package needs to be downgraded later.
