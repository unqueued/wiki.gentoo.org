'''GDM''' is the GNOME Display Manager, which provides a graphical login environment.

= Introduction =

Many users want to boot straight into a graphical environment, rather than having to log on through a Linux console and then using the <code>startx</code> command to launch the graphical desktop environment (such as GNOME). Graphical display managers provide this service, and GNOME has one called the GNOME Display Manager, or GDM.

= GNOME Display Manager v3 =

Configuring GDM v3 is only possible through systemd as it does not support other init systems anymore (which is a general feature of GNOME 3).

To start gdm upon boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable gdm.service}}

To start gdm immediately:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start gdm.service}}

= Troubleshooting =

== GDM and Optimus ==
For GDM to work with Optimus, add the following two lines to the top of <code>/etc/gdm/Init/Default</code>:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/gdm/Init/Default|title=Configuring GDM to work with Optimus|lang=bash|1=
exec xrandr --setprovideroutputsource modesetting NVIDIA-0
exec xrandr --auto
}}
== Managing users ==
Unlike the previous major version of GDM, GDM 3 does not rely on the files in /etc/gdm and/or /etc/X11/gdm to manage which users appear on the greeter screen. Everything relies on AccountsService. First of all, AccountsService is forwarding to GDM 3 all the usernames with a user id above 1000. There is not way to force GDM to consider users with a user id less or equal to 1000 unless you customize yourself the ebuild as described [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-997366-highlight-.html here].

If you want to exclude users with user ids greater than 1000 from showing on the greeter screen, you have to drop a file after the name of the user in the /var/lib/AccountsService/users directory and include in this file the stanza SystemAccount=true.

On another hand, if you have a user with a user id greater than 1000 that does not show you should check for a file after his name in the above directory and if there is one, change the stanza SystemAccount from true to false.
