Many users want to boot straight into a graphical environment, rather than having to log on through a Linux console and then using the {{c|startx}} command to launch the graphical desktop environment (such as GNOME). Graphical display managers provide this service, and GNOME has one called the GNOME Display Manager, or GDM.

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

GDM can be installed from a separate system profile by manually emerging it:

{{Emerge|gnome-base/gdm}}

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===

==== Systemd ====

To start gdm upon boot:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable gdm.service}}

To start gdm immediately:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start gdm.service}}

== Removal ==

If a GNOME system profile has been selected removing GDM is probably not the best idea, however it is possible. When migrating from GNOME to another desktop environment, it generally a good idea to simply [[GNOME/Guide#Unmerge|remove GNOME altogether]].

=== Unmerge ===

To manually remove GDM:

{{Emerge|params+=--unmerge|gnome-base/gdm}}
== Troubleshooting ==

=== GDM and Optimus ===

For GDM to work with Optimus, add the following two lines to the top of the {{Path|/etc/gdm/Init/Default}} file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/gdm/Init/Default|title=Configuring GDM to work with Optimus|lang=bash|1=
xrandr --setprovideroutputsource modesetting NVIDIA-0
xrandr --auto
}}

== Managing users ==

Unlike the previous major version of GDM, GDM 3 does not rely on the files in {{Path|/etc/gdm}} and/or {{Path|/etc/X11/gdm}} to manage which users appear on the greeter screen. Everything relies on AccountsService. First of all, AccountsService is forwarding to GDM 3 all the usernames with a user id above 1000. There is not way to force GDM to consider users with a user id less or equal to 1000 unless you customize yourself the ebuild as described [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-997366-highlight-.html here].

If you want to exclude users with user ids greater than 1000 from showing on the greeter screen, you have to drop a file after the name of the user in the /var/lib/AccountsService/users directory and include in this file the stanza SystemAccount=true.

On another hand, if you have a user with a user id greater than 1000 that does not show you should check for a file after his name in the above directory and if there is one, change the stanza SystemAccount from true to false.
