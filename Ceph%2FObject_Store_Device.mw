The Ceph object store device represents a storage area for Ceph in which objects can be placed. When a user or application places objects inside a Ceph cluster, a [[Ceph/Pool|pool]] is passed. Based on the pool and the object name, the correct ''placement group'' is deduced. 

Each placement group has a distribution map (which Ceph calls the [http://ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/crush-map/ CRUSH map]) that informs Ceph how the object should be stored (which OSDs take part) whereas the pool itself contains information on how many replicas of the object should be made.

== Mounting ==

The default location where an OSD daemon stores its objects is at {{Path|/var/lib/ceph/osd/<clustername>-<osdid>}}. For instance, the OSD daemon with id 0 in a Ceph cluster called <tt>ceph</tt> will have its location at {{Path|/var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-0}}.

This is of course configurable through the {{Path|ceph.conf}} configuration file.
