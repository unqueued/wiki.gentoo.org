This page lists '''miscellaneous anti-spam measures''' that can help prevent unwanted inbound mail to your postfix server.

==HELO/EHLO spoofing countermeasure==
{{Note|The following technique was altered from [https://www.howtoforge.com/virtual_postfix_antispam Howtoforge].}}

First create the following file, where the IP addresses and domain names in the first three lines represent those of your own server.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/postfix/helo.regexp|title=Define abnormal HELO/EHLO patterns|1=
/^myhost\.mydomain\.tld$/          550 Rejected
/^xxx\.yyy\.zzz\.xxx$/             550 Rejected
/^\[xxx\.yyy\.zzz\.xxx\]$/         550 Rejected
/^[0-9.]+$/                        550 Rejected
/^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+){3}$/            550 Rejected
}}

We then add a <code>regexp:/etc/postfix/helo.regexp</code> entry to the <code>smtpd_helo_restrictions</code> directive in <code>main.cf</code>, as follows.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/postfix/main.cf|title=Enforce HELO or EHLO formats|1=
smtpd_helo_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_invalid_hostname, regexp:/etc/postfix/helo.regexp, permit
}}

To put this in to action, reload postfix's configuration as follows.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/postfix reload}}

==Ban obviously dangerous attachment file extensions==
{{Note|This technique was lifted from [http://www.debian-administration.org/article/168/Greylisting_with_Postfix_and_other_antispam_stuff. Debian Administration].}}

If you are looking after windows users, you may wish to reject certain attachment file extensions.

{{Note|The following example includes <code>zip</code> files, this is something you may wish to remove.}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/postfix/mime_header_checks.regexp|title=Define dangerous attachment file extensions|1=
/filename=\"?(.*)\.(bat|chm|cmd|com|cpl|do|exe|hta|jse|rm|scr|pif|vbe|vbs|vxd|xl|zip)\"?$/
   REJECT Attachment type banned.
/^\s*Content-(Disposition|Type).*name\s*=\s*"?(.+\.(lnk|cpl|asd|hlp|ocx|reg|bat|c[ho]m|cmd|exe|dll|vxd|pif|scr|hta|jse?|sh[mbs]|vb[esx]|ws[fh]|wav|mov|wmf|xl))"?\s*$/
      REJECT File "$2" attachment type "$3" banned.
}}

{{Note|The list above probably needs updating; Windows no doubt has even more dangerously executable extensions these days. If you find any new ones, please contribute them here.}}

You will then need to tell Postfix to process this file.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/postfix/main.cf|Ban dangerous attachment file extensions|1=
mime_header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/mime_header_checks.regexp
}}

To put this in to action, reload postfix's configuration as follows.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/postfix reload}}


==Reducing information leaks==
{{Note|The following technique was lifted from [https://www.howtoforge.com/block_spam_at_mta_level_postfix Howtoforge].}}
With default settings, smartly written spam bots might just figure out which policy they are running up against when they attempt to send mail and are rejected. The suggestion is therefore to change rejection codes to a single, generic code in order to confuse such bots. What impact this has on legitimate clients is something you will have to test out... ''apparently'' some people use it and it works.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/postfix/main.cf|title=Genericize SMTP rejection|1=
invalid_hostname_reject_code = 554
multi_recipient_bounce_reject_code = 554
non_fqdn_reject_code = 554
relay_domains_reject_code = 554
unknown_address_reject_code = 554
unknown_client_reject_code = 554
unknown_hostname_reject_code = 554
unknown_local_recipient_reject_code = 554
unknown_relay_recipient_reject_code = 554
unknown_sender_reject_code = 554
unknown_virtual_alias_reject_code = 554
unknown_virtual_mailbox_reject_code = 554
unverified_recipient_reject_code = 554
unverified_sender_reject_code = 554
}}

To put this in to action, reload postfix's configuration as follows.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/postfix reload}}

==Enforce complete SMTP implementations==
These checks are basic but help to weed out spam bots that have been written poorly and do not confirm to RFCs, as well as spam bots that attempt to enumerate local addresses via the SMTP <code>VRFY</code> command.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/postfix/main.cf|title=Enforce complete SMTP implementations|1=
smtpd_helo_required = yes
disable_vrfy_command = yes
strict_rfc821_envelopes = yes
}}

To put this in to action, reload postfix's configuration as follows.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/postfix reload}}
