===Usage===
{{Cmd|gringotts}}

file > new

select string, and set the safebox's password.  Now simply drop your passwords into the program as if it were a text editor like gedit, kate, vim, etc...

save the safebox file anywhere you prefer, make sure you can remember or write down the safebox's password as it requires the password to unlock the file.
