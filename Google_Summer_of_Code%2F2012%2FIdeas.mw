'''Most ideas listed here have a contact person associated with them. Please get in touch with them earlier rather than later to develop your idea into a complete application.''' You can find many of them on Freenode's IRC network under the same username. If there is no contact information, please join the [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml gentoo-soc mailing list] or [irc://irc.gentoo.org/gentoo-soc #gentoo-soc on the Freenode IRC network], and we will work with you to find a mentor and discuss your idea.

You don't have to apply for one of these ideas! You can come up with your own, and as long as it fits into Gentoo, we'll be happy to work with you to develop it. Remember, your project needs to have deliverables in less than 3 months of work in most cases. Be ambitious but not too ambitious ;)

'''Applications are now open''' â€” The earlier you hand yours in the better, but don't rush through it! We have a '''custom application template''' that we will ask you to fill out. Here it is:

{{ContentBox|Gentoo Application Template|
'''Congratulations on applying for a project with Gentoo!''' To improve your chances of succeeding with this project, we want to make sure you're sufficiently prepared to invest a full summer's worth of time on it. '''In addition to the usual application, there are 2 specific actions and 2 pieces of info we would like to see from you:'''

* '''Use the tools that you will use in your project to make changes to code''' (e.g., source code management [SCM] software such as CVS, Subversion, or git). Please use the same SCM as you will use for your project to check out one of our [http://anoncvs.gentoo.org/ repositories] ([http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/ more repositories]), make a change to it, and post that change as a [http://www.network-theory.co.uk/articles/patchintro.html patch] on a mailing list or [http://bugs.gentoo.org/ bug]. Please fix a real bug reported in [http://bugs.gentoo.org/ Bugzilla] to show that you can use the tools to make a meaningful change. Your contact in Gentoo can help you determine which SCM and repository you should use for this as well as a good bug to fix. If your idea doesn't have a contact, please get in touch with us on the [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml gentoo-soc mailing list] or in real-time [irc://irc.gentoo.org/gentoo-soc on IRC]. Once you've made your change, link to it from your application.
	
* '''Participate in our development community.''' Please make a post to one of our [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml mailing lists] and link to it from your application ([http://archives.gentoo.org archives.gentoo.org] holds past postings). The gentoo-soc list would be a good starting point, if you aren't subscribed to any others already. The best posts would be an introduction of the project you're applying for and a little background about you, to introduce yourself to the community and get some broader input about your project.
	
* '''Give us your contact info and working hours.''' Please provide your email address, home mailing address, and phone number. This is a requirement and provides for accountability on both your side and ours. Also, please tell us what hours you will be working and responsive to contact via email and IRC; these should sum to at least 35 hours a week.

These actions are things you will do extremely commonly as an open-source developer, and they really aren't that hard, so don't let them hold you back! The remainder of the application is free-form. '''Please read our [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/userrel/soc/applying.xml application guidelines] and [http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/faqs Google's FAQ] to complete it.''' Good luck!}}
