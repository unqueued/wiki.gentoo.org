'''Most ideas listed here have a contact person associated with them. Please get in touch with them earlier rather than later to develop your idea into a complete application.''' You can find many of them on Freenode's IRC network under the same username. If there is no contact information, please join the [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml gentoo-soc mailing list] or [irc://irc.gentoo.org/gentoo-soc #gentoo-soc on the Freenode IRC network], and we will work with you to find a mentor and discuss your idea.

You don't have to apply for one of these ideas! You can come up with your own, and as long as it fits into Gentoo, we'll be happy to work with you to develop it. Remember, your project needs to have deliverables in less than 3 months of work in most cases. Be ambitious but not too ambitious ;)
