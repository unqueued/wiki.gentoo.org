|OpenRC Improvements|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
OpenRC is the default init system in Gentoo and a viable alternative for various operating system and distribution.

The project aims to make OpenRC an even more compelling and easy to deploy init system.

Tasks:
* Better integrations with non-sysvinit systems such as busybox init and runit.
* Provide migration/importers to compatible init scripts (e.g. systemd units)
* Better integration with network management programs (e.g. connman)
* Improved support for service hotplugging
