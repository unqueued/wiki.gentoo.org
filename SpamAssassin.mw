== Configuration ==

SpamAssassin comes with a number of modules (or plugins) that can be enabled or disabled via configuration files. These files can be found under {{Path|/etc/mail/spamassassin}}. When new plugins appear in a release of SpamAssassin, they are configured in a file named (for example) {{Path|v341.pre}}, which corresponds to SpamAssassin v3.4.1 and contains configuration for new plugins as of that version.

Your local configuration belongs in {{Path|local.cf}}; however, any file with a <code>.cf</code> suffix (in that same directory) will be loaded by SpamAssassin.

=== Bayes SQL database ===

By default, SpamAssassin comes configured to use BerkeleyDB (<code>USE=berkdb</code>) for its bayes database. If you chose some other database (e.g. <code>USE=mysql</code>, <code>USE=postgres</code>, or <code>USE=sqlite</code>), then you will need to configure SpamAssassin to use that database before SpamAssassin will run.

Detailed instructions are provided with SpamAssassin and can be found in {{Path|README.bayes}} within your SpamAssassin documentation directory (something like {{Path|/usr/share/doc/spamassassin*/README.bayes}}).

== Spam detection rules ==

Our SpamAssassin ebuilds do not ship any rules. You need to download these yourself after SpamAssassin has been installed. The simplest way to do this is to run <code>sa-update</code>, but first, you need to download and install the SpamAssassin project's GPG key (so that the authenticity of the rules can be verified).

To install the GPG key,

{{RootCmd|wget -q https://spamassassin.apache.org/updates/GPG.KEY
|sa-update --import GPG.KEY}}

Now you should be able to download the rules:

{{RootCmd|sa-update}}

To improve performance, you may also wish to compile the rules:

{{RootCmd|sa-compile}}

(that should output a bunch of junk).

=== Daily updates ===

The SpamAssassin project regularly releases new and updated rules. It is a good idea to schedule your updates (at least) daily, so that your rules are never out of date. A cron job is ideal for this:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/cron.daily/spamassassin-rule-updates|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/bash
#
# Update SpamAssassin rules and reload daemons that use them.
#

# First, redirect stdout to /dev/null.
exec 1>/dev/null

# This thing sometimes spits out its progress onto stderr. If you
# don't have that problem (at least one user reports I'm crazy),
# then you'd be better off without the redirection here.
sa-update 2>/dev/null

# Exit code 0 means new updates were installed. Exit code 1 means 
# that we were already up-to-date. Anything else is failure.
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    sa-compile

    # Do you run spamd or amavisd? Both daemons need to be reloaded
    # in order to pick up the newly-updated rules. These "status"
    # checks should succeed only when the daemon is running. They are
    # OpenRC-specific, but sys-apps/openrc is part if @system so that
    # should be fine.
    /etc/init.d/spamd status && /etc/init.d/spamd reload
    /etc/init.d/amavisd status && /etc/init.d/amavisd reload

    if command -v systemctl &>/dev/null; then
        # The systemctl (systemd) executable is installed, so try to use it
        # to restart spamd and amavisd.
        systemctl try-restart spamd
        systemctl try-restart amavisd
    fi
fi
}}
