{{DISPLAYTITLE:ACPI dock}}

This article describes the setup of an [[ACPI]] based docking stations and media bays.

== Installation ==

Activate the following kernel options for dock support:

{{KernelBox|title=Enabling ACPI dock support|1=
Power management and ACPI options  --->
    [*] ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support  --->
        [*] ACPI Support
            [*]   Dock
}}

{{Note|Remember to recompile the kernel and to reboot the machine when enabling build-in kernel support. Without this step the new kernel will not be loaded into memory.}}

== Usage ==

After the driver is loaded, for each docking station or media bay a directory {{Path|/sys/devices/platform/dock.0}}, {{Path|/sys/devices/platform/dock.1}}, etc. will be created. The files and their information can be used in scripts to adjust power management, monitors (screens), or any dock related settings.
