Drivers for the ASUS N56JR can be installed according to the appropriate wiki pages. I ran into issues with the wireless, but I don't recall what they were exactly - iirc, I had to add the lines manually to .config for the kernel. ATM it is working with the Atheros 802.11n wireless cards support installed as a module with the Atheros ath9k PCI/PCIe bus support enabled.
