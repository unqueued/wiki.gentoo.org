The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system and offers an interface for programs to access the hardware. The kernel contains most of the device drivers.

== 安装 ==

=== USE flags ===

To create a kernel, it is necessary to install the kernel source code first. The Gentoo recommended kernel sources for a desktop system are, of course, {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}. These are maintained by the Gentoo developers, and patched to fix security vulnerabilities, functional problems, as well as to improve compatibility with rare system architectures.

{{USEflag|package=sys-kernel/gentoo-sources|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}:
|build++no
|deblob
|symlink
}}

=== Emerge ===

Now install {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}:

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}

== Alternative kernels == 

Portage树中还有各种备选的内核源代码：

* {{Package|sys-kernel/vanilla-sources}} - The official, non-patched Linux kernel sources. These sources are left as is, they do not contain any additional patches and are therefore not supported by Gentoo support or developers.
* {{Package|sys-kernel/hardened-sources}} - Gentoo sources with security enhancements.

=== Sources overview ===

; [[Kernel/Overview|Kernel sources overview]]: Most, if not all, of the kernel sources packages available in Gentoo are detailed in the kernel sources overview article. Navigate there for further knowledge on specific kernel sources available in the Portage tree.

=== Searching all alternatives ===

A full list of kernel sources with short descriptions can be found by searching with <tt>emerge</tt>:

{{Emerge|params=--search|sources}}

== Configuration help ==

; [[genkernel|Automatic configuration]]: <tt>genkernel</tt> is a tool used to automate the build process of the kernel and initramfs. The goal of genkernel is to help users through the kernel building process.

; [[Kernel/Configuration|手工配置]]: 手工配置使得用户——通过一些努力——可以创建一个定制的内核配置。

; [[Kernel/Gentoo Kernel Configuration Guide|Gentoo kernel configuration guide]]: Gentoo's kernel configuration guide.

; [[Kernel/Upgrade|Upgrade]]: 通过已有的内核配置升级新内核。

; [[Kernel/Removal|Removal]]: 如何移除旧的内核。

; [[Kernel/Configuration/Kernel_Seeds|Kernel Seeds]]: Like the option above, Kernels Seeds help the user, with some effort, create a custom-fit kernel configuration using an existing {{Path|.config}} as a base.

; [[Kernel/Migrate 2.4 to 2.6|2.4 to 2.6 Migration]]: Migration guide from Linux 2.4 to Linux 2.6. Since the Linux kernel codebase has significantly moved past 2.6, these migration steps are no longer relevant, but may be useful for helping administrators understand.
