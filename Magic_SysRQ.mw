Magic SysRq (Magic System Request) is a kernel hack that enables the kernel to listen to specific key presses and respond by calling a specific kernel function. Magic SysRq is activated via input from the keyboard or a serial line.

{{Warning|Magic SysRq should '''''not''' be'' enabled <u>in kernel</u> for production or mission critical systems! Even if Magic SysRq is disabled at boot using for example {{c|sysctl}}, it still leaves {{Path|/proc/sysrq-trigger}} open. Not to mention the fact that re-enabling SysRq is as easy as disabling it.}}

== Kernel ==

A basic Magic SysRq configuration:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable Magic SysRq (<var>CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ</var> and <var>CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE</var> respectively)|1=
Kernel hacking  --->
   [*] Magic SysRq key
   (0x1) Enable magic SysRq key functions by default
}}

{{Important|The <var>CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ_DEFAULT_ENABLE</var> value must always be written in the kernel with hexadecimal (0x) form (not integer numbers).}}

== Usage ==

=== Invocation ===

On {{Keyword|amd64}} and {{Keyword|x86}} systems the key combination of {{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|SysRq}}+<command key> will result in Magic SysRQ invocation. See the following table for some possible options:

{| class="table table-striped table-condensed"
|-
! Command key !! Description
|-
| {{Key|b}} || Immediately reboot the system without syncing or unmounting the disks.
|-
| {{Key|e}} || Send a SIGTERM to all processes, except for init.
|-
| {{Key|s}} || Attempts to sync all mounted filesystems.
|-
| {{Key|u}} || Attempts to remount all mounted filesystems read-only.
|}

More information can be found in the [https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html official Magic SysRQ Linux Kernel documentation].

{{Note|Not all keyboards include a {{Key|SysRq}} key. Typically {{Key|Print Screen}} is the same key.}}
