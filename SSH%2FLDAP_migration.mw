=== Why migrate? ===

Originally, Gentoo used [https://code.google.com/archive/p/openssh-lpk/ OpenSSH LDAP public key patch] from Eric Auge. However, this patch is dead and doesn't work anymore with OpenSSH 7.7 or newer because auth_parse_options() function was removed in OpenSSH via [https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/7c856857607112a3dfe6414696bf4c7ab7fb0cb3 commit 7c856857607112a3dfe6414696bf4c7ab7fb0cb3].

In the meantime this patch was rewritten by Red Hat from scratch. Instead of patching OpenSSH, the new implementation make use of OpenSSH's AuthorizedKeysCommand feature. However, this requires a configuration change.

{{Warning|'''The new LDAP implementation uses a different LDAP schema per default. However, you can use previous schema. This migration guide will tell you how you need to configure sshd to work with previous schema.'''}}

...but someone needs to write that guide first.
