|Gentoolkit improvements|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Gentoolkit's euse application is in need of a rewrite from bash to python.  This conversion would not be enough for a complete gsoc project on it's own, but could be extended with additional features, functions that could be shared with other gentoolkit utilites.  There are other changes desired in equery, eclean, enalyze that can be done as well.
