== Improvements to gentoolkit ==
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Gentoolkit's euse application is in need of a rewrite from bash to python.  This conversion would not be enough for a complete GSoC project on it's own, but could be extended with additional features, functions that could be shared with other gentoolkit utilities.  There are other changes desired in equery, eclean, enalyze that can be done as well.  Familiarity with gentoo and gentoolkit would be a plus in aiding the applicant to prepare a complete and thorough application, but not a necessity.  For further information contact us to discuss your ideas and/or proposal.
