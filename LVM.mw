''LVM'' (Logical Volume Manager) is a software which uses physical devices abstract as PVs (Physical Volumes) in storage pools called VG (Volume Group). Whereas physical volumes could be a partition, whole hard drives grouped as JBOD ('''J'''ust a '''B'''unch '''O'''f '''D'''isks) or complete RAID systems.

== Installation ==
First we need to enable the ''device mapper'' in our kernel:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
   Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM)  --->
       <*> Device mapper support
           <M> Crypt target support
           <M> Snapshot target
           <M> Mirror target
       <M> Multipath target
           <M> I/O Path Selector based on the number of in-flight I/Os
           <M> I/O Path Selector based on the service time</pre>}}
{{Note|You probably don't need everything enabled, but some of the options are needed for [[#LVM2_Snapshots]], [[#LVM2_MIRROR]], [[#LVM2_Stripeset]] and encryption.}}
{{Package|sys-fs/lvm2}} is available on Gentoo Linux and supports the following useflags:
* clvm = Allow users to build clustered lvm2
* cman = Cman support for clustered lvm
* lvm1 = Allow users to build lvm2 with lvm1 support
* nolvmstatic = Allow users to build lvm2 dynamically
* readline = Enables support for libreadline, a GNU line-editing library that almost everyone wants
* static-libs = Build static libraries
{{Note|there are some development USE flags which are not listed here}}
The package comes with a start-stop-daemon, which we start and add to the boot runlevel:
{{ShellRoot|/etc/init.d/lvm start && rc-update add lvm boot}}

== Usage ==
LVM organizes storage in three different levels as follows:
* hard drives, partitions, RAID systems or other means of storage are initialized as PV (Physical Volume)
* Physical Volumes (PV) are grouped together in Volume Groups (VG)
* Logical Volumes (LV) are managed in Volume Groups (VG)
