=== Emerge ===
Install {{Package|net-proxy/squid}}:
{{emerge|squid}}

== Boot Service ==
=== OpenRC ===
To start squid on boot:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add squid default}}

To start squid immediately:
{{RootCmd|rc-service squid start}}

== SSL Configuration ==
Make sure you have the SSL USE flag enabled. At the time of writing, Google Chrome, Chromium, and Firefox 30 and later have support for SSL proxies. Unfortunately, configuring them isn't as straight-forward as going into the options dialog of those browsers.
=== Certificate Generation ===
Generate a self-signed SSL certificate, or use a CA to sign the certificate so it is trusted by all of your clients.
 openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -nodes

=== Configure Squid ===
Edit Squid's config file /etc/squid/squid.conf, replacing the `http_port 3128` line with:
 https_port 3128 cert=/etc/squid/cert.pem key=/etc/squid/key.pem

== Browser Configuration ==
=== Firefox ===
Set firefox to manual proxy, and point it @ localhost port 3128 or 127.0.0.1 port 3128.


== Custom Error Page Icons ==
CSS controlls the squid icon on error pages, to insert your own icon simply replace the link url in /etc/squid/errorpage.css section #titles (so long as you use a 91x50 pixel image you can get away with changing nothing.  if you want a different size image padding is .5 x height, and padding left is exactly width of future image replacement.

Once done editing

{{RootCmd|rc-service squid restart}}
