{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== xorg.conf ===
The [[X server]] is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit X.Org's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

=== grub.conf ===
The configuration for grub needs to be modified to enable kernel modesetting (KMS). Append the following to the end of the <code>kernel</code> line in grub.conf:<br />
<code>
kernel /boot/kernel-name root=/dev/root-name nouveau.modeset=1
</code>
