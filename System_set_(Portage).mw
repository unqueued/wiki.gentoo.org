'''The system set contains the software packages that are required for a standard Gentoo Linux installation.'''

The system packages are defined by the Gentoo profiles (through the <code>packages</code> file). An end-user can easily see which packages are seen as part of the system set through '''emerge''':
{{RootCmd|emerge -1p @system}}
