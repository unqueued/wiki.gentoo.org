'''The system set contains the software packages that are required for a standard Gentoo Linux installation to run properly.'''

The system packages are defined by the Gentoo [[profile]]s (through the {{Path|packages}} files). An end-user can easily see which packages are seen as part of the system set through '''emerge''':
{{Emerge|params=--oneshot --pretend|@system}}
