The '''system set''' contains the software packages required for a standard Gentoo Linux installation to run properly.

The system packages are defined by the Gentoo [[profile]]s (through the {{Path|packages}} files). An end-user can easily see which packages are seen as part of the system set by running the following {{c|emerge}} command:

{{Emerge|params=--pretend|@system}}
