This page is intended for collecting ideas, planning ahead etc bla bla. for the still far-off FOSDEM 2016.

== Stand ==
Gentoo will have a stand (1 table) on FOSDEM 2016 which is coordinated by K_F. That means we want a minimum of two people there throughout the conference. Volunteers are welcome to be added to the schedule to help out.
* Who is bringing a banner?
* Who is attending at all?
* What else do we want to show at the stand?
* See also swag...

== Swag ==
* LiveDVD - status?
* Do other materials already exist? Stickers, buttons, ...

== Talks ==
A quick scan shows no Gentoo devs as speakers, and no Gentoo talk in the distributions devroom.

== Keysigning ==
* We can't do it after the distro devroom, there will not be enough time.
* Should we just do it at the dinner, even if it's annoying?
