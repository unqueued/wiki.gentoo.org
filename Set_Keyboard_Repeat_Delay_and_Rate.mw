If you are working with [[Vim]] for example, navigating through text can be much faster with a higher autorepeat rate.

=== Generic X11 ===
You can use the [[xset]] command to set 400 milliseconds delay and 100 repeat rate.
{{Cmd|xset r rate 400 100}} 

=== KDE Plasma ===
Open '''System Settings''' and navigate to '''Input Devices''' module, then '''Keyboard'''. Set '''Delay''' and '''Rate''' to your preferred values.
