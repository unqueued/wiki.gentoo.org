== Usage ==

Using livestreamer to watch your favorite stream is fairly simple. Use the following command and adjust the options to your liking:

{{Cmd|livestreamer -p ''player URL stream-quality''}}


''player'' should be your selected player. The default player is vlc, but other players such as mplayer or mpv can be used as well. Livestreamer should be able to locate the player by the name, but he path to the player can be used as well. 

''URL'' is the location of the stream you would like to watch. In all cases, "http://" can be omitted, and in some cases "www" can be omitted as well. 

''stream-quality'' is the quality you would like. For some streams it can be from "best" to "worst" and for others it is a different scale. For Twitch, it is "audio," "mobile," "low," "medium," "high," and "source."
