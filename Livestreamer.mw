Livestreamer is a CLI tool that pipes video streams from services like twitch.tv into a video player. A full list of the video players supported can be found [http://docs.livestreamer.io/players.html#player-compatibility here]. Dailymotion, Livestream, Twitch, Ustream, and YouTube Live are all supported without add-ons. 

== Installation ==

== Overlay ==

For now. Livestreamer is accessible in the Pamler overlay:

{{RootCmd|layman -a palmer}}

=== USE flags ===

USE flags will be present once the package is available in the main ebuild repository. 
<!-- {{USEflag|package=net-misc/livestreamer}} -->

=== Emerge ===

Once the overlay is installed:

{{Emerge|net-misc/livestreamer}}

== Usage ==

Using livestreamer to watch a favorite stream is fairly simple. Use the following command and adjust the options as needed:

{{Cmd|livestreamer -p <player> <URL> <stream-quality>}}

Where <code><player></code> is the selected player. The default player is {{c|vlc}}, but other players such as {{c|mplayer}} or {{c|mpv}} can be used as well. Livestreamer should be able to locate the player by the name, but the full path to the player can be used as well. 

<code><URL></code> is the location of the stream to watch. In all cases, <code>http://</code> can be omitted, and in some cases <code>www</code> can be omitted as well. 

<code><stream-quality></code> is a text value that defines the stream's quality. For some streams it can be from <code>best</code> to <code>worst</code> and for others it is a different scale. For Twitch, values include: <code>audio</code>, <code>mobile</code>, <code>low</code>, <code>medium</code>, <code>high</code>, and <code>source</code>.
