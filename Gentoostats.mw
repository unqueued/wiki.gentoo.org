[https://soc.dev.gentoo.org/gentoostats/static/about.html '''gentoostats'''] can collect several statistics from Gentoo machines. It was a [http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2011/vh4x0r/26001 Google Summer of Code 2011 project].

== Installation ==
Gentoostats is available through the ''betagarden'' [[overlay]]. Make sure you have the ''git'' USE flag enabled in {{Package|layman}} to install the repository. Also, the package is unstable, so add it to your keywords file.
{{RootCmd|layman -a betagarden}}
{{Emerge|gentoostats}}

When first installed, the program created a unique identifier for your machine. Use this identifier later to view the statistics of your machine. The identifier is stored in {{Path|/etc/gentoostats/auth.cfg}}.

== Sending Statistics ==
Sending statistics of your machine is simple. You can control which statistics are sent by editing {{Path|/etc/gentoostats/payload.cfg}}.
{{RootCmd|gentoostats-send}}

== Viewing Statistics ==
The [https://soc.dev.gentoo.org/gentoostats/ website] can be used to view some aggregated statistics. To view the stats in json (instead of the regular html view), you have to add the "Accept:application/json" HTTP Header to your request. For instance:
{{Cmd|curl -H "Accept:application/json" <nowiki>http://soc.dev.gentoo.org/gentoostats/arch</nowiki>}}

You can also use the commandline interface to request json formatted statistics. For instance to view the statistics available on {{Package|gentoo-sources}} or view what different architectures are used:
{{RootCmd|gentoostats-cli search -p gentoo-sources}}
{{RootCmd|gentoostats-cli list arch}}

The following options are available:
* search
** ''-c'', ''--category''
** ''-p', ''--package''
** ''-v', ''--version''
** ''-r', ''--repo''
** ''--min_hosts''
** ''--max_hosts''
* list
** ''arch''
** ''feature''
** ''lang''
** ''mirror''
** ''repo''
** ''package''
** ''use''
