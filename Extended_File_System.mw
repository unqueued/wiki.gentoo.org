The extended file system was the first in a series of file systems created exclusively for Linux. It was one of the first filesystems to use the Linux Kernel's VFS API. ext (in version 1) is defunct and is no longer used in major Linux distributions.

Several more versions of ext have been released:

* [[ext2]] - Introduced separate timestamps for file access, inode modification, and data modification. Does not support journaling.
* [[ext3]] - Supports journaling.
* [[ext4]] - Extended file system version 4.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

The {{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}} package contains the utilities to work with the filesystem. In Gentoo Linux {{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}} is part of the ''system'' set and should be already installed on the system.
{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/e2fsprogs|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}}:
|nls+yes
}}

=== Emerge ===

After setting the USE flag you should update the system so that the changes take effect:

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}
