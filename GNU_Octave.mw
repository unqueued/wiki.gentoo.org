'''GNU Octave''' is a free and open-source computing environment and high-level interactive programming language, that is primarily intended for numerical computations. 

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=sci-mathematics/octave}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|sci-mathematics/octave}}

=== Octave packages ===
Octave's functionality (i.e. selection of functions available to the user in octave) is extended via octave-packages [1], usually provided by octave-forge [2]. There are two ways to install octave packages:
* Use octave's own "pkg" command to install missing packages (requires use flag "curl")
* Use "app-portage/g-octave" to generate ebuilds for octave-packages from Octave-Forge and install them via portage


There is conflicting information about which method to prefer [3][4], so no recommendation can be given at this point.
