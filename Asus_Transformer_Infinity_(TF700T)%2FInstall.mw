= Installing Gentoo Linux on Asus Transformer Infinity (TF700T) =

Since i bought the amazing Infinity (Asus TF700T) with the keyboard dock, i started wondering how to put a real OS on it, which is my beloved Gentoo. Finally, after almost two years, i stumbled upon something called "kexecboot" and a viable approach to successfully boot native Linux fron the tablet. So, why don't using Gentoo and make the better of it?

- For does who re in a rush, here you can download a pre-built copy of my installation:
[http://www.gardiol.org/tf700/gentoo-20150516.tar.lzma LZMA compressed tar]

- Check also the README, there are some things you want to read, like the passwords...:
[http://www.gardiol.org/tf700/README.txt README.txt]

The final result is very good, it's a great little Gentoo box with amazing endurance and good performance! I recommend you follow this guide yourself, it's more in the Gentoo spirit, but i understand you might want to cut on the compilation times and use my prebuilt image above. In any case, you still need to follow at least a good part of this guide...


= Preliminary notes =

== Keyboard dock ==

You MUST have the keyboard dock, otherwise you must try to plugin some kind of USB keyboard via the OTG adapter, which i guess would be a pain to use. After you get to the point of starting X you could do without the dock, using the on-screen virtual keyboard... but i emphasize on "could", because why would you want such a pain?

Using a Bluetooth keyboard could be achieved, but clearly again only after you have successfully installed and started X, and i have not yet succeeded in getting Bluetooth working (i have not tried so far).

== Installation device and "emerging" device ==

I strongly recommend to install Gentoo on the microSD. The SD slot on the dock might work as well (and maybe can be even faster) but the risk of unplugging the dock by accident is high and the result can be fairly nasty. 

Using the internal memory is another option, but due to Asus being cheap, it's also very slow... and of course while you can replace a microSD after it wears out, if it happens to the internal memory you can kiss your device goodbye. Linux is much more write-intensive than Android and while you can mitigate it, i would worry about write cycles and such.

Another good approach is to plug an external hard-drive to the USB port of the dock (it's USB 2.0), setup your swap partition on it and move your portage build folder to it. This do increase your emerge performances and make the device much more responsive while emerging stuff. Both the internal memory and the microSD controller tend to cause severe lags when under heavy loads, like during an emerge operation.
== RAM and SWAP  considarations ==

The tables has only 1gb of ram. While it might seems a lot, and it surely was up to a few years ago, it's surprisingly small by today standards. Don't ask me why Asus choose such a limited amount on a top-level device, just live with it. While enabling swap is the traditional way of coping with limited ram, traditional swap should be avoided on the TF700T due to the extreme lagginess of the internal storage and of the microSD controller under heavy loads. Not considering wear-and-tear of the memory itself due to increased write cycles of swapping to it.

So for day-to-day usage i suggest to disable any swap file, with the exception of ZRAM, which can be enabled with the latest kernel from "that" because it's been pack ported from newer kernels.
Unfortunately compilation do require a huge amount of memory. Some packages like Firefox, Chromium and LibreOffice don't compile on my tablet if i don't enable at least 4gb of swap space, so i created a 4gb swap file on an external USB hard drive which i turn on when something fails to compile. This issue is quite arcane... as a rule of thumb, whenever your compilation fails with "internal compiler error" you want to enable your swap space and issue an emerge --resume.


= Before the first Linux boot =

The Asus Infinity (TF700T) comes out of the box as an Android tablet, it's provided with android 4.2.1 or something similar but it is not so important because we want to install Linux on it, so these steps will provide information on how to enable dual boot on this device. 

You will need to do some steps on Android before starting with Linux.

== Unlock and root ==
You must unlock your boot-loader first, follow these instructions:

Go to this link: [http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&p=28&s=1&m=ASUS+Transformer+Pad+Infinity+TF700T&os=&hashedid=fq2B3oq64av1O95u support page on Asus website], select OS Android and from utilities download the "Unlock Device App: Unlock boot loader". Now install the APK on android, follow directions and enjoy your boot-unlocked tablet (yes, this will void your warranty, you have been warned).
(the download is mirrored [http://www.gardiol.org/tf700/UnLock_app_V8.apk here] in case the original source goes offline)

For more directions, check this XDA thread: [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2252563 XDA on unlock TF700T]

At this point you need root. My suggestion is to install a custom ROM which will do everything for you. Which one is on you, check this link on XDA [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2688891 how to root and custom ROMS] for detailed instructions and a list of ROMS, but bear in mind that at the moment the multi boot has been tested only with a few ROMS: either CROMi-X, CROMBi-KK or ZOMBi-X latest versions, on insternal SD only, no rom2sd, data2sd or anything fancy. I suggest you to stick with one of these.

If you prefer to root the original Asus ROM, again check on XDA how to do it.

== Making your tablet unbrickable ==

While there is basically no threat of bricking your tablet, it's strongly advised to follow these steps [https://www.androidroot.mobi/pages/guides/tegra3-guide-nvflash-jellybean/ here] on how to make your tablet "safe" from any messing up you might do.

In short:
* download this: [https://download.androidroot.mobi/flatline_tf700.img flatline]
* install google's ADB and fastboot (from SDK) on oyur linux pc
* flash the downloaded custom recovery: '''fastboot flash recovery flatline_device.im'''
* reboot device to recovery, select "advanced" and "wheelie", select "Step 1: Flash AndroidRoot BL"
* it will poweroff. Reboot to android, let it boot, use a bit, then reboot to recovery again
* select "Step 2: Generate wheelie blobs" from the same menu as before
* when finished, reboot and save from the device the files it has created (check under /data or /tmp for AndroidRoot or similar)

Keep these files safe, they are your lifeline.
(NOTE: these instructions are given with no warranty, use at your risk!)

== Prepare the storage ==
As noted above, i suggest you install Gentoo on the microSD. 

I suggest to plug in a very fast microSD, but be aware that the TF700T microSD slot is a bit picky. I managed to get a Sandisk 32gb Class 10 microSD to work great, while no 64gb card do work properly so far: they seems to be working, but at some random point under heavy load will drop to read-only with no warning. It seems to be an hardware issue since moving the same card to the SD slot on the dock fix the issue. 

I assume we are using the microSD slot here on at least 16gb microSD card. The bigger, the better. 8Gb might be tight, and will definitely NOT work if you plan to emerge something like LibreOffice, Firefox or Chromium on it.

You need to format it, since i am aware of no good tools on Android for doing this, put the card in to your pc and prepare two partitions:
* the first formatted as EXT4 or f2fs, at lest 16gb (better 32gb).
* the second as VFAT, for data exchange (not required, just optional if you have spare space)

Ext4 is the classical choice of filesystem indeed, but you can also experiment with the relatively new "f2fs", which claims to be specially tuned for flash storage improving both life and speed. I have not tested it, but remember to use a compatible kernel if you choose it. The latest "that" kernel is compatible with f2fs.

If you don't want to use a microSD, you could use the internal memory either by replacing the Android partition (not recommended, too small) or using the Android data partition (not recommended due to possible wear and tear).

(Repartitioning the internal memory is STRONGLY NOT ADVISED. I was thinking about it but was discouraged by the fact it does not use any common partition scheme and no linux tools are able to mess with it. Plus the fact that it can really brick your tablet requiring you to grab the lifeline from last paragraph)

== Memory devices and partitions ==

As a reference, the device with the dock has the following storage devices / mount points:

mmcblk0: internal memory
* /dev/mmcblk0p1: Android /system partition
* /dev/mmcblk0p2: Android /cache partition
* /dev/mmcblk0p3: Recovery image
* /dev/mmcblk0p4: Recovery staging
* /dev/mmcblk0p5: Android device-specific hardware stuff
* /dev/mmcblk0p6: Android encrypted DRM keys
* /dev/mmcblk0p7: unused
* /dev/mmcblk0p8: Android /data partition, the real internal memory

mmcblk0: the tablet MicroSD slot
/dev/sdb: the dock SD slot

Usually, the first block device you attach to the USB port of the dock get the /dev/sda device group.

More details [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2004273 here (XDA)]

== Setting up dual-boot ==
Dual-booting the tablet is done using a kexec method which is just brilliant. The full thread on XDA is [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2387133 here]. 

In short, '''with the changes we need for Gentoo''':
* Check you have a supported ROM and recovery (CROMBi-KK and TRWP for me worked well)
* boot into your ROM and make sure you have terminal emulator, root and busybox installed
* download this: [https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=23991606952593990 scripts] (Mirrored [http://www.gardiol.org/tf700/TF700t-AKBI-v2.6.7.zip here])
* extract in the internal memory, you should get a folder called ''TF700t-AKBI-v2.6.7''
* don't download any rootfs, you will be making your own with Gentoo on it soon enough.
* become root: ''su bash''
* run the script: ''sh firstintall.sh'' (it will install the multiboot blob).
* When prompted, select the proper kernel for your android from the list (a mistake here will make your Android installation unbootable, but you can fix it from the multiboot prompt later on, left as an exercise in patience)
* When asked for the rootfs image, just terminate the script. We will not setup a rootfs image, we will install Gentoo ourselves.
* If the script gives an error (missing rootfs image, for example) just ignore it, all you need is the kexec blob for the multiboot to be installed and the android kernel to be copied.

(remember you are on Android here, not Linux, so things are different. For once, you must run shell script by invoking the shell itself and not by directly run the script, as the partition you have normally access to it's mounted as no-exec)

Very well, at this point we should have the multiboot installed and the android kernel restored for the multi-boot. 
We now need to configure the multiboot for booting linux from the microSD card:
* prepare to mount the multiboot partition: ''mkdir -p /data/media/0/kexecbootcfg/''
* mount the multiboot partition: ''mount -t vfat /dev/block/mmcblk0p5 /data/media/0/kexecbootcfg/''
* Create the config folder: ''mkdir -p /data/media/0/kexecbootcfg/multiboot/''
* Create/edit the file called boot.cfg in this directory, this is mine as an example:
 #Android#
 LABEL=CROMBi-KK
 BOOT=3
 DEVICE=/dev/mmcblk0p1
 DIR=/
 KERNEL=/boot/zImage
 INITRD=/boot/initrd.img
 PRIORITY=10
 #Linux ext partition image on microsd partition 1 #
 LABEL=Gentoo on microSD partition 1
 BOOT=3
 DEVICE=/dev/mmcblk1p1
 DIR=/
 KERNEL=/boot/zImage
 INITRD=/boot/initrd.img
 PRIORITY=110
* Adapt the example to your needs!
* Unmount the multiboot partition: ''umount /data/media/0/kexecbootcfg/''

The Linux entry will not boot until we set up the kernel for it, but at least you should be able to reboot into Android. Try it out! The tablet will boot twice, the first time will show you the menu, the second will actually boot Android. While this is a bit annoying, it's a necessary evil as you will actually first boot the bootloader-kernel which will in turn boot your selected OS.

As Workdowg himself explains on XDA:

''"What happens here is by flashing the kexecboot kernel blob (to mmcblk0p4) you are given a menu to choose a rootfs to boot from, ie Android, Linux image file, Linux on a partition... So in order for the kexecboot kernel to be of any use to you, you need to install Android and Linux kernels in your rootfs. It then reboots using the kernel you chose. The config file, boot.cfg, is installed to a small 5MB vfat partition (mmcblk0p5)''

''ANDROID: Android mounts root (mmcblk0p1) "/" as /system. So we install a kernel (without modules, you did that when you installed your ROM) to a directory we make called /boot which needs to be in the mount /system directory. This kernel (zImage and initrc.img) is just extracted from _that's cm112 or _that9oc+ kernel blobs and a copied to the /boot directory.''

''LINUX: This kernel was especially compiled by JoinTheRealms from _that5 source using configs moreD_cn came up with. It needs to be installed in /boot of a Linux rootfs."''

At this point you have a working dual-boot on your tablet, we need to build Gentoo so you also have something to dual-boot!

= Installing Gentoo: before first boot =

This is basically the standard Gentoo Handbook, so i will not bore you on the basics, but a few important things must be noted, so please keep reading.

== Prepare for first Gentoo boot ==

I assume you want to install on the first partition of your microSD card. If not, just follow these instructions but perform them on the media you want to use (loopback image, internal memory, SD card, whatever)

These instructions will allow you to do everything from your tablet on Android, but if you prefer to make things easier, put the microSD into your linux PC and perform them there, then move the microSD to the tablet and skip to the reoot part.

I assume your microSD has already been formatted and that the first partition is the gentoo root partition. If you have a more complex partitioning scheme, have fun adapting these instructions for your case.

We need to mount the EXT4 partition, so:
* From android, open your Android Terminal Emulator and become su: ''su bash''
* create a temporary folder: '''mkdir tmpGentoo'''
* mount the microSD: '''mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk1p0 tmpGentoo''' (mmcblk1 is the microSD)

== Download stage3 for ARM-hf ==

The tablet is an ARMv7 with hard floating point. The binary NVIDIA packages which we are forced to install do require you to install this architecture, so go to the [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/arm/autobuilds/current-stage3-armv7a_hardfp/ gentoo ARM download page] and download on your tablet the latest Stage3.

Extracting it into the mounted partition can be hard depending on your busybox, decompressing the stage3 is left to your exercise (if you are desperate, just decompress it on a linux pc then mount the microSD on the tablet).

== Prepre your stage3 before first boot ==

(make sure to do these steps from your tablet and not from the PC)
Follow the gentoo handbook to install it. In short, these are the steps:
* cd into your gentoo mounted parttion: ''cd tmpGentoo''
* remount with bind dev, proc, run, sys: ''for i in dev proc run sys; do mount -o bind /$i $i; done''
* create your ''etc/resolv.conf'', put inside your DNS server (Android does not have one, so you must create it from scratch)
* chroot: ''chroot ./ /bin/bash''
* change the root password immediately: ''passwd''
* DO NOT INSTALL A KERNEL: you must use the provided that10 kernel.
* DO NOT INSTALL GRUB OR ANY BOOTLOADER: you have multiboot already in place.
* DO NOT INSTALL LOG MANAGERS: metalog, syslog-ng and the likes, will only slow down and add wear to your microSD.
* Take a look at the Gentoo Handbook to see if you need something else which i clearly forgot here.
* Don't forget to prepare your portage tree ('''emerge --sync''') and update it as needed.

== Mask and unmask packages ==
The provided tegra drivers works only with X up to 1.14 (which is not very stable) and since 1.13 has been masked due to security flaws, you must mask any xorg-server above or equal to 1.13. Also, many ebuilds are not yet classified as "stable" for ARM, but are nevertheless very much usable. You will need to unmask a lot of stuff, i am posting here my '''/etc/portage/packages.accept_keywords''' for you to copy:
 # Firefox after v.32 do not compile on ARM
 <=www-client/firefox-32 ~arm 
 dev-libs/nss ~arm
 dev-libs/botan ~arm
 # These works great:
 media-gfx/gimp ~arm
 net-analyzer/wireshark ~arm
 dev-libs/tinyxml ~arm
 x11-libs/wxGTK ~arm
 media-libs/babl ~arm
 sys-apps/texinfo ~arm
 net-libs/gnutls ~arm
 media-libs/gegl ~arm
 sys-devel/gettext ~arm
 =net-misc/networkmanager-1.0.0 ~arm
 =gnome-extra/nm-applet-1.0.0
 =net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth-3.14.0 ~arm
 =x11-themes/gnome-icon-theme-symbolic-3.12.0 ~arm
 app-arch/p7zip ~arm
media-sound/alsa-tools **
=media-sound/pnmixer-9999 **
=xfce-extra/xfce4-power-manager-1.4.2 ~arm

As a rule of thumb, if a package has the ~arm keyword, try it out! They usually work very well (with Filezilla the only exception so far for me).

Then mask the packages for the NVIDIA blob to work, in your '''/etc/portage/package.mask''':
 >=x11-base/xorg-server-1.13.0

Since the tablet has only WiFi, i suggest strongly to install NetworkManager and use it. Since i am going to use LXDE i have also unmasked the needed packages for the nm-applet which works great with LXDE.

This is my /etc/portage/make.conf:
 CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -march=armv7-a -mfpu=vfpv3-d16 -mfloat-abi=hard"
 CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
 CHOST="armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi"
 USE="bindist"
 PORTDIR="/usr/portage"
 DISTDIR="${PORTDIR}/distfiles"
 PKGDIR="${PORTDIR}/packages"
 USE="alsa opengl mp3 aacs v4l x264 consolekit neon minizip sqlite bluetooth truetype networkmanager gudev bindist X policykit jpg jpeg tiff png dbus pdf cups udev samba lxpanel"
 MAKEOPTS="-j4"
 VIDEO_CARDS="v4l"
 INPUT_DEVICES="evdev keyboard"
 FEATURES="ccache -sandbox -usersandbox"
 XFCE_PLUGINS=""

I have enabled ccache to speed up build times and help the microSD. Since we have a quad-core i have set the -j4 to speed up make. I had to disable sandbox because some packages will not build on ARM. The various useflags are just an example, adapt to your needs. Of course, you need to ''emerge ccache'' and enable it too. The "lxpanel" USE flag and the XFCE_PLUGINS="" line are needed if you plan to use LXDE like me and want to use the power manager plugin from XFCE.

== Setup the kernel ==

No, you cannot recompile any sources provided by Gentoo nor i had any luck whatsoever with the NVIDIA provided kernel sources, according to what the NVIDIA devs say we should get an updated kernel from Asus itself. So at the moment we are stuck with kernel 3.1.10 (see links at the bottom of the page) which is the latest provided by Asus. Since we already have a good working kernel ready, there is no need to add also this strain to the tablet, let's go with the provided one.

What you have to do now is copy the same kernel your Android is using (or choose a kernel from the package which contains the multiboot loader) to the /boot folder of your Gentoo partition. I leave this as an exercise for you, you want to end up with these files:
 /boot/initrd.img
 /boot/zImage

So copy both from your Android system partition.

Since some packages needs the kernel sources to be built, we need to download the sources associated to your kernel: 
* Fetch any one of the kernel sources listed below and put it under  '''/usr/src/linux'''.
* Copy your current kernel config: ''cp /proc/config.gz /usr/src/linux''
* decompress: ''cd /usr/src/linux && gunzip config.gz''
* rename: mv config .config

You kernel sources tree is now configured.

=== To play around with the kernel ===

In case you want to experiment:
* [http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/EeePAD/TF700T/JB_10_6_1_14_10_kernel.rar this] is the link to the latest official Asus kernel sources (try also from the official Asus support page in the very unlikely case there might be an update)
* [https://github.com/that1/android_kernel_asus_tf700t/releases/tag/release-that11 this] is the link to an already configured kernel for TF700T by "that" v.11 (XDA member)
* [https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_kernel_asus_tf700t this] is the link to the CyanogenMod kernel sources for the TF700T
* [http://www.gardiol.org/tf700/config.gz my config.gz] taken from a ''that'' v.10 kernel

== Setup swap for compilation ==

While enabling swap will slow down your tablet a lot, you just need it to compile some packages. As a rule of thumb, if emerging a package failes with an internal compiler error then you NEED to increase your swap. At this point i suggest 4GB of swap to compile libreoffice and firefox successfully.

Example to create the swap file:
<pre>
 dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap.img bs=1M count=4096
 mkswap /dev/swap.img
</pre>

When you need to enable it:
<pre>
 swapon /swap.img
</pre>

When you need to disable it:
<pre>
 swapoff /swap.img
</pre>

== Install driver packages ==

At this moment the only way to get X to start is using the NVIDIA provided binary blob. It sucks, albeit it works, but since i am not able to recompile any 3.1.10 kernel and try OpenTegra, there is no other way to go.

Touch screen and trackpad works great but we need to download and install the proper drviers too.

* Build Xorg, it will take some time, so you can sart building it while doing the rest of the steps: ''emerge xorg-server xorg-drivers''
* While it builds, download the NVIDIA package [http://developer.download.nvidia.com/mobile/tegra/l4t/r16.5.0/cardhu_release_armhf/Tegra30_Linux_R16.5_armhf.tbz2 from here]
* then unpack it into your root user home folder in the gentoo partition (i suggest to keep it there in case you need some files later on)
* Now doenload the trackpad drivers from [http://www.gardiol.org/tf700/xorg-x11-drv-mtev-0.1.13.tar.bz2 this] link (this is a patched version of the sources you can find [http://gitorious.org/xorg/xf86-input-mtev here], which will not compile)
* download the touch-screen drivers [http://www.gardiol.org/tf700/Multitouch-X-Driver.tar.bz2 here] (original package [https://github.com/rydberg/Multitouch-X-Driver.git here in git repository]

Now wait for Xorg to be completely built and installed.

* decompress, build and install (''make install'' is enough) both the touchpad and the touchscreen drivers.
* Decompress the Linux 4 Tegra package
* Decompress the archive nvidia_drivers.tbz2 found within ''/root/Linux_for_Tegra/nv_tegra'', it will create some folders like usr, etc and lib, DO NOT EXPAND IN YOUR ROOT FOLDER! For the following instructions i assume you will expand it into the nv_tegra folder where the archive is.
* Copy the xorg driver from ''/root/Linux_for_Tegra/nv_tegra/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers'' to ''/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers''. Pick the right one (the ABI12 in our case) and copy to the destination folder and rename it to tegra_drv.so.
* Copy MOST of the libraries from ''/root/Linux_for_Tegra/nv_tegra/usr/lib'' to ''/usr/lib'' but be VERY CAREFULL not to replace ''libjpeg.so'', you want to keep your copy of it.
* Poke around the ''/root/Linux_for_Tegra/nv_tegra'' folder, check if there are more files you want to copy to your filesystem (probably not).

== Configure the dock keyboard ==

The dock keyboard is not exactly your standard keyboard and it requires a bit of fiddling to get it right. You can use it out of the box, but your top row of keys will be messed up badly and you will lack, among all function keys, also the ESC key, which comes pretty handy usually. 

You need to fix the keyboard layout both for the console and for X. You might skip the console maybe, but it's so simple that it's a pity not to do it.


=== Fixing the keyboard layout in console ===

Create the following file (create also the missing tf700 folder, we will use it later)

Contents of file '''/etc/tf700/tf700.map''':
<pre>
keymaps 0-15

### Top row
# Back
keycode 158 = Escape
# Wifi on/off
keycode 238 = F1
	shift keycode 238 = F13
	control keycode 238 = F25
	alt keycode 238 = Console_1

#keycode 142 = SysRq

### Bottom row
# Home
keycode 172 = Alt
# Search
keycode 217 = Alt
# Menu
keycode 139 = Alt
</pre>

Now edit your ''/etc/conf.d/keymaps'' and change the default keymap like this:
 keymap="/etc/tf700/tf700.map"

Done!

=== Fixing the keyboard layout in X (easy way) ===

This is a bit more complex, because we need to patch the xkeyboard-config package. 
I have prepared a pre-patched source for it that you can download [http://www.gardiol.org/tf700/xkeyboard-config.tar.bz2 from here]. In case you want to grab and patch the latest sources, check the following paragraph.

We will be reinstalling it on top of the current portage ebuild, which is ugly and not very nice. Unless somebody more practical than me is willing to create an ebuild and, maybe, can share it with us, this what we are going to do.

* Unpack the sources into /root (for example)
* get into the source folder and configure it: ''./configure --with-xkb-base="/usr/share/X11/xkb" --enable-compat-rules --disable-runtime-deps --with-xkb-rules-symlink=xorg''
* The usual: ''make && make install''

We are done here too.

=== Fixing the keyboard layout in X (hard way) ===

== Ready to reboot? ==

You can now reboot android and try out the dual boot, if all goes well, you will get to a grentoo login console prompt and you can login as root!

= First boot: setup various, network and X =

== Some tf700t related init stuff ==

We need to do some thing to start up

copy this:

<pre>
zzzz
</pre>


Our first boot will take us to the console prompt. The NVIDIA provided binary blob for the graphic driver has the nasty habit of not being able to go back to console after starting the X server, so if anything goes wrong you cannot go back. For this reason, it's better to do the first boot text-only and switch on the X server only after you have everythinf sorted out.

== Setup networking ==
For the above mentioned issue, it's a good idea at this point to setup your network and your SSH server. If you followed all the instructions to setup the keyboard, you should have a working keyboard at this point in console, including the ESC key. 

So, let's install and configure the network with NetworkManager (of course feel free to use any other method you prefer):
* start ssh: ''/etc/init.d/sshd start''
* add sshd st boot: ''rc-update add sshd default''
* install network manager: ''emerge networkmanager''
* now use nmcli to connect to your preferred wifi: ''nmcli d wifi connect <your AP> password <your password>''

At this point if you loose the console for any reason you can always login remotely via SSH and reboot the tablet, no harm done to your microSD.



== Try out X ==
First of all we need to setup a basic xorg.conf file which will work, this is mine as an example, copy it in a file called '''/etc/X11/xorg.conf''':

<pre>
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier    "Layout0"
    Screen      0 "ScreenLVDS" 0 0

    Option "CorePointer" "true"

    Driver           "mtev"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"

    Option "CorePointer" "true"
EndSection

    Identifier      "tf700 keyboard"

    Option "XkbLayout" "us"
EndSection
</pre>

It will also configure the touchscreen and the trackpad. Yes you need also to specify the tegra driver as it will NOT be detected automatically.

At this point, type X and enjoy your first X server on the TF700T. If everything goes well, you should get an X working! Type CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE (or type CTRL+ALT+F1 to switch back to console and then type CTRL+C). Of course your console will be borked and unsuable, but if you just type '''reboot''' it should reboot...

So if you got the working X, you can proceed. If, otherwise, you got errors check your '''/var/log/Xorg.0.log''' file for errors and fix them. If you got a garbled/unusable screen, well, check a few things:
* you are using an ARMv7 hardfp Gentoo stage3 (a softfp will NOT work)
* the tegra_drv.so you are using matches the same ABI of your xorg (ex. xorg v.12 requires the v.12 tegra_drv.so)
* ... try to look for help, but it will be hard, since not many and playing with Gentoo on the TF700T. Still the Gentoo forums might be a good place to start at least to work out possible Gentoo-general issues.


== Install LXDE and slim ==

I assume you can now start a working X server, well you now need somthing to use it with. 

Due to the limited RAM and slow storage, my recomendation goes to a clean LXDE installation. As a bonus point LXTerminal seems to be basically the only terminal which adapts properly to the odd DPI size of the tablet!

Also we need a login manager. For some reason loggin in is a slow process, with at least one or two seconds delay between username and password... i guess it's due to the slow storage, but i find the best way to overcome this is setup an autologging display manager. Yes some of you might don't like it, just skip the "slim" part and propose here your valid alternative.

So, let's proceed, sfter you have your WiFi turned on of course:
* Install LXDE, be patient, take a bath, have dinner and sleep a bit: ''emerge lxde-meta'' (you might have to unmask some packages here for arm)
* Install slim: ''emerge slim'' 
* Set slim as your default XDM in ''/etc/conf.d/xdm''
* Configure slim for autologin by editing file ''/etc/slim.conf'', check the two values '''default_user''' and '''auto-login'''

It's worth to do one last experiment before setting slim to start on boot, try it manually:
* ''/etc/init.d/xdm start''

If all goes well, you are in your new shimy LXDE session! At this point we can setup automatic X startup at boot:
* ''rc-update add xdm default''

Now you can play around with X... you will immediately notice a few things like, there is no battery indicator, then you close the lid strange things will start happening on the screen, and so on. Read on to fix these issues.


== Fixing the display for touch interaction ==

== Lock screen and bind keys ==
You don't notice on Android, but then you close the lid Android will automatically lock your screen, which means actually it will lock your TOUCH screen. Linux does not do it for you, so you must set it up manually. 

Also, it's handy to be able to use those "useless" volume keys for example to regulate screen brightness. 
We can use '''xbindkeys''' to achieve all this in combination with '''xinput''' and a bit of bash scripting as glue: the basic idea is to have xbindkeys react ti the keycode and invoke the script which will use xinput to enable or disable the screen.

First of all install the tools: ''emerge xbindkeys xinput''. 

Create the script '''/etc/tf700-lock-screen.sh''':
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
if [ $(xinput --list-props 8 | grep Enabled | cut -d: -f 2) -gt 0 ]
then
	xinput disable 8
	xinput disable 9
	cat /sys/class/backlight/pwm-backlight/brightness > /tmp/.lock_touchscreen_last_brightness
	echo 0 >> /sys/class/backlight/pwm-backlight/brightness
else
	LAST_BRIGHTNESS=100
	if [ -e /tmp/.lock_touchscreen_last_brightness ]
	then
		LAST_BRIGHTNESS=$(cat /tmp/.lock_touchscreen_last_brightness)
	fi
	xinput enable 8
	xinput enable 9
	echo $LAST_BRIGHTNESS >> /sys/class/backlight/pwm-backlight/brightness
fi
</pre>

This script will lock the screen by disabling touchpad and touchscreen, and turns off the screen by setting the brightness to zero. 

By the way this is the only way to turn your screen black, beware '''DO NOT''' use any screensaver, and '''DO NOT''' use any apm/dpms related methods to turn your diplay off, as 75% of the times this will hang your tablet and wil require an hard-reset to reboot!


Create the script '''/etc/tf700/brightness.sh''':
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
CURRENT=$(cat /sys/class/backlight/pwm-backlight/brightness)
MIN=5
MAX=$(cat /sys/class/backlight/pwm-backlight/max_brightness)
if [ "$1" == "" ]
then
	echo $CURRENT
else
	if [ $1 -gt 0 ]
	then
		CURRENT=$(expr $CURRENT + $1 )
	elif [ $1 -lt 0 ]
	then
		CURRENT=$(expr $CURRENT + $1 )
	fi
	if [ $CURRENT -ge $MIN -a $CURRENT -le $MAX ]
	then
		echo $CURRENT >> /sys/class/backlight/pwm-backlight/brightness
	fi
fi
</pre>
This script will let you turn up and down the screen brightness. If invoked with no parameters will show the current brightess level, while invoked with a number, it will be used to increase or decrease the brightness, between the minimum of 5 and the hardware maximum value.

To bind these scripts to the power button and the sound volume buttins, add this to your '''~/.xbindkeys''' file:
<pre>
"/etc/tf700/lock_touchpad.sh"
    m:0x0 + c:124
    XF86PowerOff

"/etc/tf700/lock_touchpad.sh"
    m:0x0 + c:150
    XF86Sleep

"/etc/tf700/brightness.sh -10"
    m:0x0 + c:122
    XF86AudioRaiseVolume

"/etc/tf700/brightness.sh 10"
    m:0x0 + c:123
    F12
</pre>

Then add '''xbindkeys''' to LXDE startup, and now you can safely close yout lid, just remmber to press the lock button before!

== Conky ==
The proprietary NVIDIA drivers provides you with many more details like battery status... We would like to know how much battery we have left! I find '''conky''' a nifty little tool, so let's use it here:

== Install mixer and power management ==

emerge pnmixer and xfce4-power-manager

We need some specific configuration here for both.

== Make Firefox behaves better ==

set disk cache to 0
some minor CSS fixes, create the file userChrome.css in your /home/<user>/.mozilla/firefox/<profile>/ folder and write something like:
<pre>
@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);

#reload-button .toolbarbutton-icon,
#urlbar-reload-button .toolbarbutton-icon {
        width: 40px !important;
        height: 40px  !important;
}

#nav-bar .toolbarbutton-icon {
        width: 48px !important;
        height: 48px !important;
        max-width: 48px !important;
        max-height: 48px !important;
        min-width: 48px !important;
        min-height: 48px !important;
}

/*#navigator-toolbox,
#nav-bar {
        height: 64px !important;
}*/

#new-tab-button {
        height: 64px !important;
}

/*#urlbar {
        font-family: monospace !important;
        font-size: 15pt !important;
}*/

/*window:not([chromehidden~="toolbar"]) #urlbar-wrapper {
    clip-path: none;
}*/


#new-tab-button {
        height: 32px;
}
</pre>



== Improve OpenBox for touch screen ==

change window border size so that you can resize the windows with your finger.
Go to ''/usr/share/themes'' and pick your theme, edit the ''themerc'' file, check any '''border.width''' and adapt it to your needs.


== Enabling audio ==

Unfortunately, it does not wor out of the box. Asus provides an alsa driver, but the first card is the HDMI audio output, which is de-facto useless. So we need to exchange the two cards:


Emerge alsa-utils
create .asoundrc:

<pre>
pcm.!default {
type hw
card 1
}

ctl.!default {
type hw
card 1
}
</pre>
