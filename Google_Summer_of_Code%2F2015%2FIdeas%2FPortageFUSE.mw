<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Create a filesystem based on FUSE for Gentoo's package tree and overlays.
Possible tasks could include:

For users:
* Autogenerate metadata-chache in fuse (e.g. for overlays).
* Store filenames only, rsync real files on demand.
* Examine support for squashfs via fuse.

For developers:
* Remanifest when accessing package directories.
* Support different views by changing the directory structure based on metadata.xml (e.g. maintainer/category/package/).
* As we have a git-mirror for cvs ready, switch between both worlds in the same tree (hide CVS / .git directories).
