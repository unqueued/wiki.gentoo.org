{{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} contains [[USE flag|USE flags]] for individual packages. This is useful for [[USE flag|USE flags]] that should not be used globally (e.g. test, doc), and flags that are specific to a single package.

{{Note|{{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} can either be a single file or a directory containing per-package [[Handbook:Parts/Working/USE#Declaring_USE_flags_for_individual_packages|files]].}}

== Example ==

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|title=Example with this location as a single file|1=
# Globally disable the unwanted which was enabled by the profile
*/* -bluetooth -consolekit -dbus -ldap -libnotify -nls -qt3support -udisks

# enable the offensive USE flag for app-admin/sudo
app-admin/sudo offensive

# disable mysql support for dev-lang/php
dev-lang/php -mysql 
}}

== Format ==

* One DEPEND atom per line with space-delimited [[Handbook:Parts/Working/USE|USE flags]] (see [[version specifier]] for information on DEPEND atom syntax).
* Comment lines begin with <code>#</code> (hash).
