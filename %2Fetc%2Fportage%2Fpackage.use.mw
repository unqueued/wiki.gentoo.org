'''/etc/portage/package.use''' contains USE flags for individual packages. This is useful for USE flags that shouldn't be global (e.g. test, doc), and flags that are specific to a single package.

Note that {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} can either be a single file or a directory containing per-package USE flags. 

== Example ==
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use||<pre>
# enable the offensive USE flag for app-admin/sudo
app-admin/sudo offensive
# disable mysql support for dev-lang/php
dev-lang/php -mysql 
</pre>}}

== Format ==
One DEPEND atom per line with space-delimited USE flags, comment lines begin with #

See [[version specifier]] for information on DEPEND atom syntax.
