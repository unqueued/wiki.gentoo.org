== Introduction ==
At this point, Postfix should be running well and users through mailclients and webmail should have no problem sending and receiving e-mail securely. Tweaking the postfix installation can give a little more performance, make it a bit more secure and having a bit redundancy never hurts either.

== Redundancy ==
=== Introduction to backup-mx ===
For redundancy postfix offers the feature of ''backup mx''. Backup mx allows another mailhost to catch e-mail for a domain when the main mailserver is for whatever reason not responding. A backup mx server will try to deliver the mail to the original mailserver. This all sounds just perfect, however backup mx is dead. Spam killed it. The problem with backup mx nowadays is, due to spam, mail can end up bouncing the wrong way and the backup mx server may thus end up on a spam block list. This kind of mail is called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_%28email%29 Backscatter mail]. If a secondary mailserver is setup, it needs to know all of the users from the primary domain so that it can bounce ''unknown users''. A simple way to do this, is having the entire database synchronized between primary and secondary mailserver. Caveat being however the 'backupmx' flag in the domain table. This would need to be inverted on the secondary mailserver.
=== Configuring backup-mx ===
The database already knows about backup domains. If a domain ''has'' a backup mail server, the '''backupmx''' field is set to '''1''' in the '''domain''' table. Connecting postfix to the database requires a file with connection information.
{{File|/etc/postfix/pgsql/relay_domains.cf|Setup relay domains|<pre>
# relay_domains.cf
user            = postfix
password        = $password
dbname          = postfix
#hosts          = localhost
query           = SELECT description FROM domain WHERE domain='%s' AND backupmx='1' AND active='1';
</pre>}}
This then needs to be configured into postfix.

{{File|/etc/postfix/main.cf|Modify postfix for relay domains|<pre>
# The relay_domains parameter restricts what destinations this system will
# relay mail to.  See the smtpd_recipient_restrictions description in
# postconf(5) for detailed information.
relay_domains = pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql/relay_domains.cf
</pre>}}

To make proper use of ''relay_domains''
{{File|/etc/postfix/pgsql/relay_recipient_maps.cf|Setup relay recipients|<pre>
# relay_recipient_maps.cf
user            = postfix
password        = $password
dbname          = postfix
#hosts          = localhost
query           = SELECT goto FROM alias WHERE address='%s' AND active='1';
</pre>}}

Also this needs to be configured into postfix.
{{File|/etc/postfix/main.cf|Modify postfix for relay recipients|<pre>
# REJECTING UNKNOWN RELAY USERS
#
# The relay_recipient_maps parameter specifies optional lookup tables
# with all addresses in the domains that match $relay_domains.
relay_recipient_maps = pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql/relay_recipient_maps.cf
</pre>}}

After restarting postfix, the mail server is now a less-open relay, relaying mail to only approved domains and approved users.

{{Warning|Do not use ''permit_mx_backup''. [http://marc.info/?l&#61;postfix-users&m&#61;127202735107236&w&#61;2 It is dead]. Letting others relay the 'backup domains' through the mailserver, to the list of known users, is the proper way of doing it, but only if they are administers by the same user(s). Use even more caution when accepting entire domains, unless the other domain has a catch-all mailbox, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_%28email%29 Backscatter mail] will be a problem and the mailserver will most likly be blacklisted.}}
== Qouta's ==
=== Introduction ===
uotas are a tool to help a user monitor their mailbox. They are very easily abused and should not be relied on. That said, they can work well enough most of the time and give the user feedback on the status of his usage pattern. IMAP supports quota reporting and thus the mail-client can even report this the user. Thunderbird does this via an [http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/881 extension], roundcube shows this per default. 

=== Configuration ===
he database supports mail quotas however postfix requires a patch to support these mailquotas. The ''vda'' USEFlag enables this patch for postfix and allows the use of quotas.

First, the data needs to be obtained from the database.
{{File|/etc/postfix/pgsql/virtual_mailbox_limit_maps.cf|Query the database for quotas|<pre>
# virtual_alias_maps.cf
user            = postfix
password        = $password
dbname          = postfix
#hosts          = localhost
query           = SELECT quota FROM mailbox WHERE local_part='%u' AND domain='%d' AND active='1';
</pre>}}

There are a few things that need to be configured in postfix, next to the database query.
The ''Trash'' folder for example, should not be counted when automatically deleting Trash after a fixed amount of time. This can (and has) be done in courier-imap.
{{File|/etc/postfix/main.cf|Setup postfix to use quotas|<pre>
# Support for Postfix VDA quotas
virtual_mailbox_limit_maps = pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql/virtual_mailbox_limit_maps.cf
virtual_mailbox_limit_inbox = no
virtual_mailbox_limit_override = yes
virtual_maildir_extended = yes
virtual_overquota_bounce = no
# virtual_maildir_limit_message_maps = hash:/etc/postifx/limit_messages
virtual_maildir_limit_message = "Sorry, the recipients mailbox is currently full. Please try again later."
virtual_trash_count = no
virtual_trash_name = ".Trash"
virtual_maildir_filter = no
</pre>}}
{{Warning|According to the postgresql manual the maximum value of a bigint (the quota) would be ''9223372036854775807''. However only ''9223372036854774784'' can be successfully used. If for some reason however '''8 Exabytes''' is required as the quota, it is probably wiser to just turn it off by setting the quota to 0 bytes.}}

=== Testing ===
Roundcube displays diskusage per default and hovering over it displays detailed information. Thunderbird has an extension, [http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/881 Display quota]. For both and others to actually work a ''maildirsize'' file is required. This file will be created and updated whenever postfix delivers a message or when courier-imap makes chances. The file is located in each virtual users root mail dir, which would be {{Path|/var/vmail/example.com/testuser/maildirsize}} in the case of ''testuser'' on ''example.com''. Thus sending a message to ''testuser@example.com'' would create this file in the users maildir.
{{Cmd|sendmail testuser@example.com|output=<pre>
Subject: Testmail to create quota file.
No content!
.
</pre>}}
{{Note|Generally, there is no need to manually broadcast an e-mail message to generate the maildirsize file, plenty of mail should be deliverd and thus create the file, including the Welcome mail postfixadmin creates. Nevertheless, postfixadmin does have a the ability to broadcast a message, that can be used for this purpose.}}

== HELO Restrictions ==
Hackers, spammers and everybody else can obtain information from the mailserver by using the HELO and EHLO commands. Spammers usually put fake information in the HELO greeting and thus restricting and rejecting connections from servers that do not properly identify themselves can only be good. Postfix offers the ''smtpd_helo_restrictions'' variable to tune how to respond to connections. Restrictions here have to be thought over carefully however. Locking down the server too tight may make it so messages are rejected because the other server is just poorly configured. Use with regression. A quick overview of the available options.

''' ''smptd_helo_restrictions'' overview'''
* reject_invalid_hostname	  REJECT if HELO greeting is not a DN or an IP
* reject_non_fqdn_hostname  REJECT if HELO greeting is not a FQDN or an IP
* reject_unknown_hostname	  REJECT if HELO host has no A or MX in DNS
* permit_naked_ip_address	  PERMIT if HELO greeting is an IP


The following table should give an idea how mail will get rejected from the various restrictions. An '''X''' mens the message will be rejected, the '''?''' means it depends on the proper DNS record setup for that domain and '''O''' means the message will be delivered normally.
