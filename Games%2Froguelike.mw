TomeNET is a '''multiplayer''' rogue-like, based on and somewhat similar to MAngband and ToME, and also featuring some Zangband and Cthulu Angband monsters. It was created around 2001 (originally under the name of ''PernMAngband'' which had to be renamed due to a letter of Anne McCaffrey's attorney who prohibited the use of the name ''Pern'') as a fork of MAngband which got some ToME design added to it. TomeNET is feared for being hard to master, but at the same time the more rewarding to the skillful player who has learned to make use of all the nifty possibilities open to him. The game has a full-fledged documentation called ''The TomeNET Guide'' - [http://www.tomenet.net/guide.php HTML version].
