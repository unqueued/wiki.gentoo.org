The SELinux policy is what contains all the rules that SELinux will enforce. It segregates control from definition, making it possible to distribute the same access control rules towards a multitude of systems.

== Introduction ==

=== Control vs definition ===

A main advantage of having a policy is that it segregates control from definition. The access rules are described / defined in the policy. This policy is then interpreted by the SELinux subsystem to verify and manage access control.
