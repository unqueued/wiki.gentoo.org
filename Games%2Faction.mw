[http://chromium-bsu.sourceforge.net Chromium B.S.U.] is a classic arcade raster graphics vertical scrolling shoot 'em up single player game. It was written with games like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor:_Call_of_the_Shadows Raptor] in mind and the idea to enhance them for modern graphics. As such it uses opengl via {{Package|media-libs/freeglut}} or alternatively sdl, supports fullscreen and modern audio themes. View a YouTube demo [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzzM8tQgjmw here].

[[File:Openclonk_screenshot1.png|thumb|right|150px|OpenClonk]]

OpenClonk is the Open source successor of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonk Clonk gaming series], being a multiplayer-action-tactic-skill game. You could say it's an interesting mix of ''The Settlers'' and ''Worms''. In a simple 2D antfarm-style landscape, the player controls his crew of Clonks, small but robust humanoid beings. The game encourages free play but the normal goal is to build a mine and exploit the earth from valuable resources or fight each other on an arena-like map. Development is especially focused on Bustling mining, production lines and economy, fast and fiddly melees. Another focus lies on the further enhancement of the game engine and the extensibility/modability of the game content with C4Script.
