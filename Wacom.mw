[https://www.wacom.com/ Wacom] tablets, touchscreens.

== System configuration ==
{{KernelBox|title=Kernel config|1=
Device drivers --->
   HID support --->
      HID bus support --->
         Special HID drivers --->
            <*> Wacom Intuos/Graphire tablet support (USB)
}}
You probably need this option for tablet to function properly even if you don't have Intuos/Graphire tablet as it says in the description.

Some tablet models may also require these options:
{{KernelBox|title=Additional config|1=
Device drivers --->
   Input device support --->
      [*] Tablets --->
         <*> Wacom protocol 4 serial tablet support--->
      [*] Touchscreens --->
         <*> Wacom W8001 penabled serial touchscreen
         <*> Wacom Tablet support (I2C)
}}


After kernel is configured, update your INPUT_DEVICES Portage variable:
{{INPUT_DEVICES|wacom}}

You should also create Xorg config file so that Xorg knows which driver should be used for the tablet. Example:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/42-libinput.conf|lang=xorg_conf|1=
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "Tablet"
        Driver "wacom"
        MatchIsTablet "on"
EndSection
}}
== Xinput2 multitouch ==

The default setting of the <code>wacom</code> xinput driver has "gesture emulation".

If we ''disable'' it, '''true multitouch events''' will be emitted instead and can be used e.g. with [[Firefox#Enabling_multitouch|Firefox]].

{{FileBox|filename=[[:Xorg.conf|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-wacom.conf]]|1=
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "Wacom class"
	MatchProduct "Wacom{{!}}WACOM{{!}}Hanwang{{!}}PTK-540WL{{!}}ISDv4{{!}}ISD-V4{{!}}ISDV4"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"

	Driver "wacom"
	Option "Gesture" "off"
EndSection
}}
