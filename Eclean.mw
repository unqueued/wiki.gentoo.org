{{Lowercase title}}

'''eclean''' is a tool for cleaning Portage source files and binary packages.

By default, source files are in {{Path|/usr/portage/distfiles}}, while binary packages are in {{Path|/usr/portage/packages}}; this can be changed by altering the <code>DISTDIR</code> and the <code>PKGDIR</code> variables respectively in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}. Both locations can grow quite big if not periodically cleaned.

== Installation ==

Install {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}:
{{Emerge|gentoolkit}}

== Usage ==

You can clean the source files directory with the following command:
{{RootCmd|eclean --destructive distfiles}}

For the directory with the binary packages you should use the following command instead:
{{RootCmd|eclean --destructive packages}}

For more details have a look at the eclean(1) man page:
{{Cmd|man 1 eclean}}
