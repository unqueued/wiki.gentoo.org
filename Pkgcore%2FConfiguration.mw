The pkgcore configuration files support various formats, default is
the [https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html ini syntax].

Each section has an associated class which defines the scope of the
section. We will structure the following by these classes.

== Domain ==

Class: pkgcore.ebuild.domain.domain

This is the fundamental configuration object. A domain provides all
configuration options (mostly by reference onto other configuration
objects). By providing multiple domains these can be selected at
runtime.

Important attributes:
* default (boolean, e.g. True)
* root (string, e.g. '/' )
* fetcher (reference)
* profile (reference)
* repositories (references)
* triggers (references)
* vdb (reference)

=== Fetcher ===

Classes: pkgcore.fetch.base.fetcher and pkgcore.fetch.custom.fetcher

Configure how to obtain distfiles and where to store them.

=== Profile ===

Classes: pkgcore.ebuild.profile.ProfileStack and pkgcore.ebuild.profile.OnDiskProfile

Configure location of profiles and which is applicable. These can be
combined out multiple sources.

=== Repositories ===

Classes: pkgcore.ebuild.repository.tree, pkgcore.ebuild.repository.slavedtree, pkgcore.binpkg.repository.tree

Metaobject for repositories. We have different flavors:
ebuild.repository.tree is for the Gentoo tree, slavedtree is for
overlays and binpkg.repository.tree is for prebuilt package instances
(the last one is pretty much like a raw repo).

Important attributes:
* cache (references, not binpkg.repository.tree)
* raw_repo (reference, not binpkg.repository.tree)
* parent_repo (reference, only for slavedtree)

==== Repo-Cache ====

Classes: pkgcore.cache.flat_hash.md5_cache and pkgcore.cache.flat_hash.database

Configure nature and location of caches. These are used for lookup of
metadata and similar.

==== Raw Repository ====

Class: pkgcore.ebuild.repo_objs.RepoConfig

Configure location. This is the bare repository.

Important attributes:
* syncer (reference)

===== Syncer =====

Class: pkgcore.sync.base.AutodetectSyncer and pkgcore.sync.rsync.rsync_timestamp_syncer

Configure how to sync a repository.

=== VDB ===

Class: pkgcore.vdb.ondisk.tree

Configure location of the current system state.
