GNOME Configure your applications folders
'''Applications folders''' are the GNOME the containers for applications.

= Introduction =

By default in Gentoo there is no application folder and all applications are either showing in a single container without further organization than being presented in alphabetic order, either they are elected as favorites and are showing in the dash (left-side bar).

This is unsatisfactory for most people since as the number of applications is growing it becomes always harder and tedious to find out the application you want to lauch. Hence, the solution is to organize the applications by subsets similar to the submenus in previous major version of Gnome or the Applications menu you can get using shell extensions.

Our goal is to present you how you can customize your desktop and organize your applications without using the shell extensions and menus.

== Gsettings and desktop schemas ==

Your desktop is controlled by a set of XML files and schemas. You can use the dconf application to configure partly your applications, however for full customization the command line gsettings command is recommended.

First of all, to add containers for applications, which are actually called folders, you will need to edit the key org.gnome.desktop.app-folders. You can access this key and update the value through dconf by following the specified schema, org.gnome.desktop.app-folders namely. The value is a list of strings between square brackets and separated by a comma. Here is how to add the folders Office, SysAdmin and Internet after checking the list is actually empty.

{{Cmd|gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.app-folders folder-children}}

It should return and empty square brackets list. If not, you may wish to add the content of this list to your new list in the following commands instead of replacing it.

To add the folders, proceed as follow:

{{Cmd|gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.app-folders folder-children "['Office', 'SysAdmin', 'Internet']"}}

This will create the three new applications folders empty and without a name to display. They will show as empty tiles when pressing the super key and clicking on the Applications tile in the dash (left side bar).

Now, you need to give the folders a name to display on the desktop. There is two ways to do it: you can set the name to the actual name you want to display or you can set the name to a file which contains the name and translations in supported languages you want to assign to the folder.

The first alternative is straight forward, for example, for the SysAdmin folder you can proceed as follow:

{{Cmd|gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.app-folders.folder:/org/gnome/desktop/app-folders/folders/SysAdmin/ name "System tools"}}

However, if you have to support a system with multiple languages you may prefer to do it as follow:

{{Cmd|gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.app-folders.folder:/org/gnome/desktop/app-folders/folders/SysAdmin/ name "System-Tools.directory"}}

Then,

{{Cmd|gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.app-folders.folder:/org/gnome/desktop/app-folders/folders/SysAdmin/ translate true}}

The value in the first command (System-Tools.directory) must be an existing file which can be found either in the /usr/share/desktop-directories directory, either in $HOME/.local/share/desktop-directories directory with the following format:

{{File|/usr/share/desktop-directories/System-Tools.directory|Sample file content|<pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Name=System Tools
Name[fr]=Outils système
Comment=System configuration and monitoring
Comment[fr]=Configuration et surveillance système
Icon=applications-system
Type=Directory
</pre>
}}

The format is the Free desktop XDG format as documented [http://standards.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html here].

The second command inform Gnome 3 the value is not a fixed string value and it is rather than a file with translations.
