This article describes the setup of '''VDPAU''' ('''V'''ideo '''D'''ecode and '''P'''resentation '''A'''PI for '''U'''nix).

== Installation ==
Portage knows the global USE flag ''vdpau'' for enabling support for VDPAU in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|x11-libs/libvdpau}} automatically:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="... vdpau ..."
}}
The USE flags of libvdpau are:
{{USEflag
|doc
|dri+yes
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}
{{Note|In the case of ''Radeon'' driver you additionally need to do the following}}

== Radeon specific install steps ==
By default applications such as mplayer,vlc,vdpauinfo,... make VDPAU specific calls via libvdpau library.
This library then dynamically loads appropriate back-end driver ( VDPAU driver specific 
to your hardware [http://http.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/vdpau/doxygen/html/group__api__winsys__x11.html read more...]). 
At the time of writing the mechanism to automatically decide which back-end driver needs to be loaded 
was not established. Currently libvdpau is [http://http.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/vdpau/doxygen/html/group__api__winsys__x11.html hardcoded] to load nvidia backend driver. It means that VDPAU will not work properly on Radeon cards.
The only possible way to change that behavior is by specifying the correct back-end driver manually.
*  First you need to find the name of the driver related to your hardware 
(here we assume that the ''vdpau'' USE flag was enabled and the system was updated successfully). 
One way to find that name is by checking Xorg log file:
{{Cmd|cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log {{!}} grep -i vdpau|output=
 (II) RADEON(0): [DRI2]   VDPAU driver: r300}}
The output will show if VDPAU driver has been initialized properly (two leading (II) letters in the sample output above).  It also should specify the name of back-end driver (r300 in the sample output).
*  Now you can manually setup the name of back-end driver with help of VDPAU_DRIVER environment variable. 
To do that you need to add the following line to ~/.bashrc file (provided that Bash is the default shell of a user who is going to run graphical environment). For the sample case described above the mentioned line would look like: 
{{FileBox|filename=~/.bashrc|title=Loged as a user who run graphical interface|lang=bash|1=export VDPAU_DRIVER=r300}}.
*  Now {{Package|x11-misc/vdpauinfo}} should show you an information about your VDPAU configuration instead of an error message.

=== Other Software ===
* {{Package|x11-misc/vdpauinfo}}: shows if VDPAU is supported.
* VDPAU can be used as a [[VAAPI]] backend.

== Configuration ==
You may need to tweak the config files of the programs, you can make use of ''VDPAU''.

=== mplayer ===
Detect the available VDPAU video codecs:
{{Cmd|mplayer -vc help {{!}} grep --color vdpa}}
Add them to the mplayer config file, e.g.:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf|1=
[vo.vdpau]
vc=ffh264vdpau,ffodivxvdpau,ffmpeg12vdpau,
}}
{{Note|The comma at the end of the ''<code>vc</code>'' line is important!  This tells MPlayer to fall back to other video out methods if the VDPAU driver is unsuccessful}}
