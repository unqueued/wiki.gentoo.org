<!-- Description goes here: --> 
Multiple projects such as portage-utils and pkgcore have their own C-based implementations of parsing package atoms and related support. At some point it would be nice if they all shared a common, well-tested implementation in the form of a library along with bindings for various languages (python being the main, initial focus). This could obviously be extended over time to include other forms of functionality that could benefit from a common implementation, for example a constraint-based dependency resolver with different types of solvers.
