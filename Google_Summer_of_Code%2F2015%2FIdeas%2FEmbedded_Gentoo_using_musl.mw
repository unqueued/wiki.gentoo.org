|Embedded Gentoo using musl|
<!-- Description goes here: -->
This project involves integrating an alternative standard C library called musl into Gentoo, both for cross compiling and native compiling. [http://www.musl-libc.org Musl] aims to be "lightweight, fast, simple, free, and strives to be correct in the sense of standards-conformance and safety. So far, stage4 tarballs have been built for [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/experimental/amd64/musl amd64], [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/experimental/x86/musl i686] and [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/experimental/arm/musl armv7a-hardfloat-eabi]. These were initially built using cross compiling toolchians which themselves were built using [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/embedded/handbook/cross-compiler.xml crossdev], but then were rebuilt on native hardware using home grown scripts, and not [https://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/catalyst catalyst]. Picking up from here, the next steps in the project are:

* To build cross compiling toolschains for mips32r2-o32, mipsel3-o32 and mips64r2-n32 architectures/abis. This will involve properly intergrating musl with crossdev which currently has some bugs.
* To build stage 4 tarballs for the those architectures. This involves, among other things, patching various packages that don't conform to strict POSIX which musl assumes.
* These stages need to be converted to stage3's, properly built using catalyst rather than using the technique which the homegrown scripts use. <pre>ROOT=rootfs emerge -e @system</pre>
* If all goes well, the project can continue to porting over the [[:Project:Hardened|hardened tool chain]] to those architectures.
