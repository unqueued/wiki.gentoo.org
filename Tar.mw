GNU {{c|tar}} is [[Article description::an archiver tool that provides the ability to create tar archives, as well as various other kinds of manipulation.]] The three most used functions are ''storage'', ''backup'' and ''transportation''. Five more advanced operations are: ''--append'', ''--update'', ''--concatenate'', ''--delete'' and ''--compare''. In addition, tar supports many kinds of compression, among others: gzip, bzip2, lzip, lzma, lzop, xz, and gz.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-arch/tar}}

=== Emerge ===

After adjusting USE flags:

{{Emerge|app-arch/tar}}

== Removal ==

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|app-arch/tar}}

=== Environment variables ===

{{Cmd|tar --help}} displays by default the short tar option summary. This summary is organized by groups. The exact visual representation of the help output is configurable via <var>ARGP_HELP_FMT</var> environment variable. For more information please refer to [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_87.html#SEC183 GNU's tar manual]

== Usage ==

=== Invocation ===

==== help ====

{{Cmd|tar --help|output=<pre>
Usage: tar [OPTION...] [FILE]...
...
</pre>}}

Most of the tar operations and options can be written in any of three forms: long, short and old style. 

{{Note|The "old style" option forms exist in GNU tar for compatibility with Unix tar.}}

==== Three most frequently used options ====

===== Creation =====

{{Cmd|tar --create}}

or

{{Cmd|tar -c}}

===== Listing =====

{{Cmd|tar --list}}

or

{{Cmd|tar -t}}

===== Extraction =====

{{Cmd|tar --extract}}

or

{{Cmd|tar -x}}

Some useful options are:

* <code>-xz</code>: for {{Path|tar.gz}} or {{Path|.tgz}}.
* <code>-xy</code>: for {{Path|tar.bz2}} or {{Path|.tbz2}}.
* <code>-xJ</code>: for {{Path|tar.xz}} or {{Path|.txz}}.


{{Note|The fastest way to extract a tarball is <code> tar -xf tarball</code>, because it can recognize any additional extension}}

===== Additional options =====

* To specify the name of an archive:

{{Cmd|tar --file{{=}}archive-name}}

or

{{Cmd|tar -f ''archive-name''}}

* For showing the files being worked on as tar is running:

{{Cmd|tar --verbose}}

or

{{Cmd|tar -v}}

For additional information refer to [https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_13.html#SEC13 Official documentation]

==== Compression ====

In order to create a compressed tar file, also known as 'tarball', there are many ways, but the best one may be:

{{Cmd|tar --auto-compress}}

or

{{Cmd|tar -a}}

This option will select the compression program based on the suffix of the archive file name. For example:

{{Cmd|tar caf archive.tar.bz2}}

This command will produce a bz2 tarball, while:

{{Cmd| tar -caf archive.tar.lzma}}

will produce a lzma tarball.

{{Note|As we mentioned before, the "old" style is maintained for compatibility reasons, and so <code>caf</code> and <code>-caf</code> still work the same way. }} 

== Additional information ==

Because of the wide number of tar's options is not possible to cover all the advanced features of this program on a single wiki entry. Some of the more advanced features include.

* Add files to existing archives
* Updating an archive
* Options used by <code>--extract</code>
* Performing backups and restoring files
* Excluding some files 
* Crossing file system boundaries
