== Troubleshooting ==

{{Note|Keep in mind that issues below could be limited to a specific unit of Lenovo Thinkpad L540 as well as depends on BIOS version that has been used. Findings based on "20AUA1FFPB (LENOVO_MT_20AU_BU_Think_FM_ThinkPad L540)"

=== Unable to shutdown/reboot, irq N:nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option), system turns dead after resume from hibernation. ===

It seems that with kernel '''<4.0''' you may have issues halting the system, which will result in hang after message about powering off. With kernel '''=4.0''' you may have no longer such issue but after you resume from hibernation, USB ports may not work at all as well as you may start seeing the message about irq that nobody cared. With kernel '''=4.1''' systems after resume from hibernation turns dead. The apps are semi-responsible but no new process can be spawned, like storage was offline. Booting with `'''irqpoll'''` does make the system works as it should.

=== Brightness control does not work ===

Depends on kernel version, you may need to boot with either '''acpi_osi=Linux''' or with empty string '''acpi_osi='''

=== Random system hangs with possible screen artifacts ===

Since update to BIOS version J4ET76WW (1.76) random hard-freezes have been experienced. The screen usually is torn apart.
