This page attempts to summarise the '''benefits of Gentoo''' as viewed by its users, with regards to other Linux distributions.

==Community==
*Due to the structure of the Gentoo system, Gentoo's user community tends to be relatively knowledgeable about lower level aspects of Linux (build processes, kernel configuration, hardware support) than the some other Linux distributions' communities (such as those of binary-based distributions).

==Efficiency==
*Gentoo has a well deserved reputation for its community's tendency to build optimized code with demonstrable increases in efficiency over binary-based distributions' "one size fits all" model.

==Flexibility==
*Gentoo allows users to configure which features of software they wish to install, instead of the "one size fits all" approach of many binary-based distributions.
*Gentoo can run in a wide range of environments, from embedded systems and virtual containers ([[LXC]], [[OpenVZ]], etc.) through to large cluster machines.

==Scalability==
*Due in a large part to Gentoo's ''portage'' tool's configurability and its source-based approach to software management, Gentoo is relatively well suited to deployment from tiny embedded systems right up to large cluster machines.

==Security==
*Due to the flexibility inherent in Gentoo's ''portage'' tool and USE flags, Gentoo encourages users to build software with only the features they need.  This decreases code size and complexity, which tends to increase security.
*The [[Hardened Gentoo]] project focuses on increasing the security of Gentoo Linux through a variety of means.
