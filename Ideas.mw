This is a place for Gentoo developers to share information about their efforts to improve Gentoo among themselves and with others. This also includes ideas that they are unable to pursue in a reasonable period of time that would be best taken by someone else. Our hope is that this will foster greater collaboration and increase innovation in Gentoo.

Please keep these lists alphabetized. When you add an item, please include a description of what this is, a statement of how this benefits Gentoo and who is working on it. Feel free to list your name in things that need developers if you are interested, but are unable to work on this without collaborators. Preferably, please use the [[Ideas/Template|idea template]].

=== Gentoo Minix port ===
Minix is a BSD-style operating system by Andrew S. Tanenbaum. It uses a microkernel architecture and it is designed with a strong emphasis on reliability. It is designed to be able to recover from hardware faults and it is also quite small.

Porting Gentoo to Minix will enable us to provide an operating system with the ability to recover from hardware faults. It could also serve as a research environment for future projects.

* looked at it, it is painful to get working. [[User:666threesixes666|666threesixes666]] ([[User talk:666threesixes666|talk]]) 13:43, 11 September 2013 (UTC)

=== Gentoo Hurd port ===

micro mach kernel, instead of monolithic linux kernel.  basically same idea as minix.
