'''D'''ynamic '''H'''ost '''C'''onfiguration '''P'''rotocol '''C'''lient '''D'''aemon ('''DHCPCD''') is a popular DHCP<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131 RFC 2131] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP]</ref> client for Gentoo Linux users.  '''DHCPCD'''<ref>[http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/index DHCPCD homepage]</ref> offers a large feature set and easily integrates into OpenRC.<ref>[[Network_management_using_DHCPCD/OpenRC message|Integration with OpenRC]]</ref>

== Installation ==
=== USE flags ===
{{USEflag|package=net-misc/dhcpcd|desc=Optional USE flags for net-misc/dhcpcd:<ref>{{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd}}</ref>
|embedded+++Embed the definitions of dhcp options in the dhcpcd executable
|ipv6
|udev+Yes+Yes
}}

=== Emerge ===
Use the following command to install dhcpcd:

{{RootCmd
|emerge  --ask net-misc/dhcpcd
}}

== Configuration ==
All its configuration goes into {{Path|/etc/dhcpcd.conf}} but for most installations nothing needs to be done there, presumed that most computers nowadays are behind a router or access point providing DHCP. Though <kbd>man 5 dhcpcd.conf</kbd><ref name=manpage>http://roy.marples.name/man/html5/dhcpcd.conf.html</ref> will be helpful in case of advanced configuration demand.

=== Static IP address ===
In case the network interface card should be configured with a static IP address, add their data to the configuration file.<ref name=manpage /> The following is an example of manually adding a static address, routes and DNS by editing the appropriate configuration file using a text editor of choice:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/dhcpcd.conf|lang=bash|1=
static ip_address=192.168.0.10/24
static routers=192.168.0.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1
}}
