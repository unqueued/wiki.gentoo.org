Kernel live patching is an update-and-coming feature being developed by a few corporate Linux companies. Several companies have open sourced their development efforts, making it possible to bring kernel live patching to Gentoo.

A note of caution: Kernel live patching is risky. Count on hard freezing the kernel a few times.
