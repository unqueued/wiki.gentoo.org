<noinclude>The example below shows how the main Gentoo repository is set up using the webrsync method via the {{Path|webrsync.conf}} file in the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf]]/}} directory. For more information visit the [[Project:Portage/Sync#Portage_configuration|Portage Sync article]].</noinclude>
{{FileBox|filename=[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf/webrsync.conf]]|title=webrsync example|lang=ini|1=
[DEFAULT]
main-repo = gentoo

[gentoo]
location = /usr/portage
sync-type = webrsync (or websync, depending on portage version)
auto-sync = yes
}}

== Optional: Install app-arch/tarsync ==

The {{Package|app-arch/tarsync}} utility enables webrsync to sync direcltly from tarball, skips extraction, speeds up the process.

{{RootCmd|emerge app-arch/tarsync}}

== Optional: Verify releng Signature ==

{{Note|The [[Handbook:Parts/Working/Features#Pulling_validated_Gentoo_ebuild_tree_snapshots|Pulling validated Gentoo ebuild tree snapshots]] Guide in the handbook is newer than the section following here and should definitely work.}}

Until git migration, the only method to securely sync portage was to check releng signatures of portage snapshot.

Create gnupg home with releng keys:

{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/portage/gnupg}}
{{RootCmd|chmod 0700 /etc/portage/gnupg}}
{{RootCmd|GNUPGHOME{{=}}/etc/portage/gnupg gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 0x96D8BF6D}}

Trust the key:

{{RootCmd|GNUPGHOME{{=}}/etc/portage/gnupg gpg --edit-key --fingerprint 0x96D8BF6D|output=<pre>

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

Change ownership to porage:

{{RootCmd|chown -R portage:portage /etc/portage/gnupg}}

Append webrsync-gpg to FEATURES in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} and set location of gnupg home:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=webrsync gpg|lang=bash|1=
FEATURES="${FEATURES} webrsync-gpg userfetch"
