Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.

== Install ==
=== Emerge ===
{{emerge|wireshark}}

== Configure ==
{{Warning|Running Wireshark as root can be dangerous and is unnecessary. See the [https://wiki.wireshark.org/Security/ Wireshark Security] page for more details.}}
As wireshark captures from hardware, it needs permissions set to enable capturing. To use wireshark as a normal user, add user to the wireshark group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a $USER wireshark}}

To make the session aware of this new group without having to log in again, enter this command before launching wireshark:

{{RootCmd|newgrp wireshark}}

== Techniques ==

=== Network Name Resolution ===
To automatically resolve IP addresses to domain names, open the preferences window from {{Path|Edit -> Preferences}}, clicking the {{Path|Name Resolution}} panel and selecting the '''Enable Network Name Resolution''' check box.

{{Note|Enabling Network Name Resolution will increase the captured traffic due to additional DNS requests.}}

=== Filter packets to a specific IP Address ===
To see all incoming and outgoing traffic for a specific address, enter {{Path|ip.addr}} == {{Path|w.x.y.z}} in the filter box , replacing {{Path|w.x.y.z}} with the relevant IP address. Additionally, to view only incoming traffic, replace {{Path|ip.addr}} with {{Path|ip.src}}; to view only outgoing traffic, replace {{Path|ip.addr}} with {{Path|ip.dst}}.

=== Terminal-based Wireshark ===
TShark is Wireshark's terminal-based network protocol analyzer. TShark's native file format is '''pcap'''. All packet capture options are listed by entering

{{Cmd|tshark -h}}

For example, to capture packets across a specified network interface and save the results, enter

{{Cmd|tshark -i wlan0 -w capture-output.pcap}}

Replace {{Path|wlan0}} with the desired network interface and {{Path|capture-output}} with the desired filename.
