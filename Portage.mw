{{Package|sys-apps/portage}} is Gentoo's [[Wikipedia:Package management system|package manager]], and is installed by default as part of the stage3 install. See the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo Handbook] for more details.

==Installation==
In the case you somehow do not have Portage or removed it accidentally, there are ways you can recover it.
Here are a few viable solutions in order for you to get it (back) on your system:
#Have a friend or build server build Portage binaries for you and then transfer them to your machine.
#Manually download a copy of Portage tarball, build it, and then install it yourself.
#Boot up a LiveCD that has Portage included (like a Gentoo LiveDVD) and use <code>emerge sys-apps/portage</code> with <code>PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT=/root/mountpoint</code> to install Portage.

For example, if the root file system was mounted at {{Path|/mnt/gentoo}} this command could be used from a live environment:
{{RootCmd|PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT{{=}}/mnt/gentoo emerge -uN sys-apps/portagee}}

== Overlays ==
In addition to the official repository (colloquially known as "portage tree" because of its traditional placement in {{Path|/usr/portage/}}), there are additional repositories which in Gentoo are called [[overlay]]s.

* [http://layman.sourceforge.net/ Layman homepage]
* [http://gpo.zugaina.org/ Browse overlays]

You can search through the ebuilds available in the overlays on http://overlays.gentoo.org/ by using the [[eix]] tool.

== Command-line interface: emerge ==
'''emerge''' is the command-line interface to the Portage system. This is how most users will interact with Portage. The <code>emerge</code> command has many possible options. For a complete list of all options see its man page:

{{Cmd|man emerge}}

Below you see an exemplary invocation of <code>emerge</code>. The options (<code>-atv</code>) are shortcuts for <code>--ask</code>, <code>--tree</code> and <code>--verbose</code>. They trigger <code>emerge</code> to ask before proceeding, display the dependency tree of packages to be installed, and to be verbose with its output. While in the context of Portage, the term "package" can also be referred to as an "atom." Don't be confused if you see the term "atom" used instead of the term "package."
