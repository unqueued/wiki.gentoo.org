Portage is the heart of Gentoo. It is the default [[Wikipedia:Package management system|package manager]] for Gentoo.

== (Re)Installation ==

In the case the system somehow does not have Portage (maybe it became corrupted or it was accidentally removed) there ''are'' ways it can be recovered.

Here are a few viable solutions in order for a system administrator to get Portage (back) on a system:
#Have a friend or a build server build Portage binaries build, then transfer them to the broken machine. This could be done using the <code>buildpkg</code> Portage feature on a healthy machine or by using the <tt>quickpkg</tt> command. See the [[binary package guide]] for more information.
#Manually download a copy of a recent Portage release via tarball, build it, and manually install it. The administrator will have to perform all the work that Portage world normally automate. This option could be easier than the first option, and may potentially take less time.
#Boot up a LiveDVD/CD that has Portage included ([http://get.gentoo.org/ Gentoo LiveDVDs] or [http://www.sysresccd.org/ SystemRescueCD] should contain Portage). Remove the old or broken Portage and reinstall install Portage to the mounted root filesystem (potentially the fastest and easiest option in the case of a fast internet connection and available CDs/DVDs). For example, if the root file system with broken Portage was mounted at {{Path|/mnt/gentoo}} the following commands could be used from a live environment.
## Change all of Portage's relevant environment variables to be set to the Portage directory of the mounted root filesystem. If the broken Portage root directory is mounted at {{Path|/mnt/gentoo}}, the command would look like this: {{RootCmd|DISTDIR{{=}}"/mnt/gentoo/usr/portage/distfiles" PKGDIR{{=}}"/mnt/gentoo/usr/portage/packages" PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT{{=}}"/mnt/gentoo/" PORTAGE_TMPDIR{{=}}"/mnt/gentoo/var/tmp" PORTDIR{{=}}"/mnt/gentoo/usr/portage"}}
##Run the <tt>emerge</tt> command in order to remove any traces of the old broken Portage package: {{RootCmd|emerge -C sys-apps/portage}}
##Sync the Portage Tree in case the system is a bit behind on the current Portage tree: {{RootCmd|emerge --sync}}
##Install the new version of Portage: {{RootCmd|emerge -uN sys-apps/portage}}

== Configuration ==

=== Overlays ===

In addition to the official repository (colloquially known as the "Portage Tree" because of its traditional placement in {{Path|/usr/portage/}}), there are additional repositories which in Gentoo called [[overlay|overlays]].

* [[Project:Overlays/User_Guide|Users' guide to Gentoo overlays]]
* [http://layman.sourceforge.net/ Layman homepage]
* [http://gpo.zugaina.org/ Browse overlays]

It is possible to search through the ebuilds available in the overlays on http://overlays.gentoo.org/ by using the [[eix]] tool.

=== GUI interfaces ===

There are a few GUI interfaces that exist for Portage, although some of them have become unmaintained.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! Package !! Homepage !! Maintained? !! Description
|-
| <tt>[[kport]]</tt> || Unavailable || http://kport.sourceforge.net/ || No || A GUI frontend for the Portage package management system.
|-
| <tt>[[kuroo]]</tt> || {{Package|app-portage/kuroo4}} || http://sourceforge.net/projects/kuroo/ || Yes || Graphical Portage frontend based on KDE4/Qt4.
|-
| <tt>[[porthole]]</tt> || {{Package|app-portage/porthole}} || http://porthole.sourceforge.net/ || Yes || A GTK+-based frontend to Portage.
|}

== Usage ==


=== Emerge ===
<tt>emerge</tt> is the command-line interface to the Portage system. This is how most users will interact with Portage. The <tt>emerge</tt> command has ''many'' possible options. For a complete list of all options see its man page:

{{Cmd|man emerge}}

Below you see an exemplary invocation of <tt>emerge</tt>. The options (<code>-atv</code>) are shortcuts for <code>--ask</code>, <code>--tree</code> and <code>--verbose</code>. They trigger <tt>emerge</tt> to ask before proceeding, display the dependency tree of packages to be installed, and to be verbose with its output. While in the context of Portage, the term "package" can also be referred to as an "atom." Do not be confused if you see the term "atom" used instead of the term "package."

==== Common invocations ====

* Search for packages with <tt>proxy</tt> in their names

:: {{Cmd|emerge --search proxy}}

* Search for packages with <tt>proxy</tt> in their names or description

:: {{Cmd|emerge --searchdesc proxy}}

* Install package tinyurl with <code>--ask</code> and <code>--verbose</code> options for precaution

:: {{RootCmd|emerge --ask --verbose tinyurl}}

* Remove package tinyurl using the dependency sensitive <code>--depclean</code> option instead of <code>--unmerge</code> which may remove important packages

:: {{RootCmd|emerge --ask --verbose --depclean tinyurl}}
