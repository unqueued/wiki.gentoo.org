{{Package|sys-apps/portage}} is Gentoo's [[Wikipedia:Package management system|package manager]], and is installed by default as part of the stage3 install. See the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo Handbook] for more details.

==Installation==
In the case you somehow do not have Portage (it could have became corrupted or you might have removed it accidentally) there ''are'' ways you can recover it.
Here are a few viable solutions in order for you to get it (back) on your system:
#Have a friend or build server build Portage binaries for you and then transfer them to your machine (hardest, and most time consuming).
#Manually download a copy of Portage tarball, manually build it, and then manually install it yourself. You will be doing all the work that Portage makes automatic (easier than the first option, and probably would take less time).
#Boot up a LiveDVD/CD that has Portage included (like a Gentoo LiveDVD or SysRescCD) in order to remove and then to reinstall install Portage to your mounted root filesystem (potentially the fastest option in the case that you have a CD/DVD burnt). For example, if the root file system with broken Portage was mounted at {{Path|/mnt/gentoo}} the following commands could be used from a live environment.
## First change all of Portage's relevant environment variables to be set to the Portage directory of the mounted root filesystem. If you mounted your broken Portage root directory at {{Path|/mnt/gentoo}} the command would look like this: {{RootCmd|DISTDIR{{=}}/mnt/gentoo/usr/portage/distfiles PKGDIR{{=}}/mnt/gentoo/usr/portage/packages PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT{{=}}"/mnt/gentoo/" PORTAGE_TMPDIR{{=}}/mnt/gentoo/var/tmp PORTDIR{{=}}"/mnt/gentoo/usr/portage"}}
##Next run the <code>emerge</code> command in order to remove any traces of the old broken Portage package: {{RootCmd|emerge -C sys-apps/portage}}
##You should then sync your Portage tree (in case your system is a bit behind on the current Portage tree): {{RootCmd|emerge --sync}}
##Finally install the new version of Portage: {{RootCmd|emerge -uN sys-apps/portage}}

== Overlays ==
In addition to the official repository (colloquially known as "portage tree" because of its traditional placement in {{Path|/usr/portage/}}), there are additional repositories which in Gentoo are called [[overlay]]s.

* [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml Gentoo Overlays: Users' Guide]
* [http://layman.sourceforge.net/ Layman homepage]
* [http://gpo.zugaina.org/ Browse overlays]

You can search through the ebuilds available in the overlays on http://overlays.gentoo.org/ by using the [[eix]] tool.

== Command-line interface: emerge ==
'''emerge''' is the command-line interface to the Portage system. This is how most users will interact with Portage. The <code>emerge</code> command has many possible options. For a complete list of all options see its man page:

{{Cmd|man emerge}}

Below you see an exemplary invocation of <code>emerge</code>. The options (<code>-atv</code>) are shortcuts for <code>--ask</code>, <code>--tree</code> and <code>--verbose</code>. They trigger <code>emerge</code> to ask before proceeding, display the dependency tree of packages to be installed, and to be verbose with its output. While in the context of Portage, the term "package" can also be referred to as an "atom." Don't be confused if you see the term "atom" used instead of the term "package."
