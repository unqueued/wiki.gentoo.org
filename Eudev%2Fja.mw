For configurations not using {{c|[[systemd]]}}, '''{{c|eudev}}''' is Gentoo's [[device file]] manager for the Linux kernel.<ref>{{Bug|575718|text=Bug 575718 - Request for council decision RE virtual/udev default provider}}, [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ Gentoo's Bugzilla Main Page], (Last modified) February 27th, 2016. Retrieved on March 1st, 2016.</ref> It manages device nodes in {{Path|[[#The_.2Fdev_directory|/dev]]}} and handles all user space actions when adding or removing devices.  It is a fork of {{c|systemd}}'s {{c|[[udev]]}} with the goal of obtaining better compatibility with existing software such as [[OpenRC]], [[Wikipedia:Upstart|Upstart]], older kernels, various toolchains, and anything else required<ref>[[Project:Eudev]], [[Main_Page|Gentoo Wiki]], (Last modified) November 12th, 2015. Retrieved on March 11th, 2016.</ref> by (but not well supported through) {{c|udev}}. Configurations utilizing {{c|systemd}} should not use it.

== The /dev directory ==

{{:/dev/en}}

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

Some packages know the <code>[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/udev udev]</code> [[USE flag]] for enabling {{Package|virtual/udev}} integration.

{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/eudev}}

=== Emerge ===

To avoid registration in the [[World_set_(Portage)|world set]], the oneshot option should be used.

{{Emerge|sys-fs/eudev|params=--ask --oneshot}}

== Configuration ==

=== RC service ===

The RC name is udev, not eudev.  It needs to be registered in the sysinit runlevel.

{{RootCmd|rc-update add udev sysinit|output=<pre>
 * rc-update: udev already installed in runlevel `sysinit'; skipping</pre>}}

From {{Package|sys-fs/udev-init-scripts}} version 29 onward, <code>udev-trigger</code> should also be [https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2015-06-08-udev-init-scripts-changes.html added to the sysinit runlevel].

=== Migrating from udev to eudev ===

Migrating from udev 216 to eudev 1.10-r2 (March 2015) is straight forward:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/eudev|params=--ask --oneshot}}

In case the system uses multilib and, for example, has the <code>abi_x86_32</code> USE flag active against the older udev package, then don't forget to change it too:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|title=Switching udev to eudev in package.use|lang=bash|1=
# sys-fs/udev abi_x86_32
sys-fs/eudev abi_x86_32
}}

==== Keep classic 'eth0' naming ====

{{:Eudev/Network_device_names/en}}

Alternatively add <code>net.ifnames=0</code> to the kernel command line, change the default policy or create a custom one.

An interesting resource related to the network naming is [https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/#idontlikethishowdoidisablethis I don't like this, how do I disable this] on the Freedesktop wiki.

==== Use new 'predictable' naming ====

The new network interface naming convention is not the same so interfaces will need to be re-linked. Use {{Path|/etc/init.d/net.lo}} as a link target for whatever interface names need to be added. Be sure to replace ''<code><interface_name></code>'' in the commands below with the Ethernet interface names present on the system. It is possible to discover which interfaces exist by running the {{c|ifconfig}} command:

{{Cmd|ifconfig}}

Create symbolic links for the existing interfaces in the {{Path|/etc/init.d/}} and {{Path|/etc/conf.d/}} directories:

{{RootCmd
|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.lo /etc/init.d/net.''<interface_name>''
|ln -s /etc/conf.d/net.lo /etc/conf.d/net.''<interface_name>''
}}

Add the script(s) to the default runlevel to have the interface(s) start automatically:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add net.''<interface_name>'' default}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Using udevadm ===

Start {{c|udevadm monitor}} and see what happens:

{{Cmd|udevadm monitor}}

Get device info using {{c|udevadm info }} followed by the device path:

{{Cmd|udevadm info -p /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7}}

Get the device path using its name:

{{Cmd|udevadm info -q path -n input/mouse1|output=<pre>
/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-3/1-3.4/1-3.4:1.0/0003:046D:C404.0006/input/input24/mouse1</pre>}}

Test an event run using {{c|udevadm test}} followed by the device path for which an event is to be tested:

{{Cmd|udevadm test /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7}}

To get a list of all {{c|udevadm}} commands:

{{Cmd|udevadm -h}}

=== Migrating older releases ===

==== udev 171-r10 to eudev 1.2-r1 ====
