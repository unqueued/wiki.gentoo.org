Get the device name by listing the {{Path|/sys/class/net}} directory contents using {{c|ls -al}} or the {{c|tree}} command (provided by the {{Package|app-text/tree}} package):

Network device names <code>eth0</code>, <code>eth1</code>, etc. as provided by the kernel could be changed on boot (see dmsg) by this certain [[eudev]] (or [[udev]]) rule:
 {{path|/lib/udev/rules.d/80-net-name-slot.rules}}
To keep the classic  naming this rule can be overwritten with an equally named empty file in the {{path|/etc/udev/rules.d}} directory:
{{RootCmd
|touch /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-name-slot.rules
}}</translate>
