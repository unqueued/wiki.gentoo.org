'''memtest86+''' is [[Article description::memory test software based on the (commercially available) [http://www.memtest86.com/ memtest86] program.]]

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/memtest86+}}

=== Prerequisites ===

Memtest86+ '''does not support UEFI'''. You can switch to Memtest86 V5 or newer for UEFI supported memtesting.

Be sure {{Path|/boot}} (where the GRUB files are typically installed) is available ''before'' installing memtest86+! If {{Path|/boot}} is on a separate partition (which it ''WILL BE'' if the partitioning scheme in the Gentoo handbook was used for this Gentoo install), then be sure the mount command is run before the emerge section below:

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}

If no errors are return then boot should be successfully mounted. Check by running the {{c|mount}} command without any arguments and parsing the output with {{c|grep}}:

{{Cmd|mount {{!}} grep boot|output=<pre>
boot
</pre>}}

=== Emerge ===

Ask Portage to install it:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/memtest86+}}

== Configuration ==

=== GRUB legacy ===

Replace the <code>?</code> (question marks) in the file below with correct numbers for the system's boot partition:

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/grub/grub.conf|1=
title=memtest86+
root (hd?,?)
kernel /boot/memtest86plus/memtest
}}

=== GRUB2 ===

For GRUB2 just run {{c|grub-mkconfig}}. As long as the package has been emerged, a configuration file has already been installed to {{Path|/etc/grub.d/39_memtest86+}}:

{{RootCmd|grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

{{Note|If GRUB2 was installed with the <code>multislot</code> <var>USE</var> flag, use the command {{c|grub2-mkconfig}} instead.}}

=== LILO ===

For LILO, add this to the {{Path|lilo.conf}} configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/lilo.conf|1=
image  = /boot/memtest86plus/memtest
label  = memtest86+
}}

Then rebuild LILO's MBR entry:

{{RootCmd|lilo}}

=== Syslinux ===

Add this to the configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf|1=
LABEL memtest86+
	MENU LABEL memtest86+
	LINUX /boot/memtest86plus/memtest
}}

== Usage ==

To use memtest86+ the system needs to be rebooted using the newly added boot item

== Removal ==

=== Unmerge ===

{{Emerge|params+=--unmerge|sys-apps/memtest86+}}
