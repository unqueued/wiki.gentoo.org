{{Note|Currently this logs everything I have done to set up the OctoPrint E-Build within my personal repository. My intention is to distribute the E-Build in due course at which point this will transition into a document detailing how to install the E-Build. Please bear with me while I get this all resolved.}}

OctoPrint
=========

OctoPrint is a 3D Printer Server.

Printers
--------

OctoPrint supports a large number of printers out of the box. the complete listing is provided : Link currently misplaced

User(s) and Group(s)
--------------------

From the OctoPrint Manual one should create a OctoPrint User and allow them access to the Serial and Terminal groups. For now I'm running octoprint as the root user.

Serial
------

The Arduino website discusses serial connection [http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All issues]. 
A User on the [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-907860-start-0.html Gentoo Forums] provides a more structured guide on resolving these.
