{{Note|Currently this logs everything I have done to set up the OctoPrint E-Build within my personal repository. My intention is to distribute the E-Build in due course at which point this will transition into a document detailing how to install the E-Build. Please bear with me while I get this all resolved.}}

OctoPrint
== OctoPrint ==

OctoPrint is a 3D Printer Server.

== Printers ==

OctoPrint supports a large number of printers out of the box. the complete listing is provided : Link currently misplaced

== Installaion ==

The installation places files in the following locations 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Path !! Description
|-
| /var/lib/octoprint || The home folder for the OctoPrint User, containing all it's configuration, log and stored files
|-
| /etc/init.d/octoprint || RC-Service Script for starting and stopping OctoPrint
|-
| /etc/conf.d/octoprint || This is where the OctoPrint configuration file should go but currently does not (See the home folder)
|-
| /usr/bin/octoprint || This is the main Python script that is called by the service, you can csll it yourself but it will then execute under you profile, creating a .OctoPrint folder in your home directory
|-
| /usr/libs/python2_7/site-packages || The main installation of OctoPrint Code goes into one Python installation
|}
===Cura===


Cura is a 3D slicing program which seems to have gone through three major architecture changes roughly coinciding with versions 0.15.X and 2.1.X.
OctoPrint (Currently 12.1) does not support the 2.1.X implementation and the EBuild locks in at the 0.15.6 version available in the gentoo repository.

When OctoPrint calls Cura it might fail with one of the following error codes. I have not worked out what the differences, causes or resolutions are for each one just yet. I did find they occurred when trying the 2.1.X version of Cura with the 12.5 version of OctoPrint. I simply list them here for now, perhaps they are investigated further by other parties.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Error Code !! Error Description
|-
| 1 || Cura Executed but did not produce a G-Code file. In the logs only the help text is shown indicating it does not like the call arguments
|-
| 2 || This only occurred once while I was fiddling about with my installation so I have no further information on this one at this time.
|-
| 6 || The call to Cura included a whole series of text which appears to be mostly Meta information about the STl file, but I stand corrected.

=== User(s) and Group(s) ===

The OctoPrint manual recommends one should create an OctoPrint user and allow it access to the Serial and Terminal groups. Gentoo provides the tty group for terminal access but this is not really required by OctoPrint and there is no Serial group so instead the uucp group is specified in the EBuild.

=== Serial ===

The Arduino website discusses serial connection [http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All issues]. 
A User on the [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-907860-start-0.html Gentoo Forums] provides a more structured guide on resolving these.
