{{Note|Currently this logs everything I have done to set up the OctoPrint E-Build within my personal repository. My intention is to distribute the E-Build in due course at which point this will transition into a document detailing how to install the E-Build. Please bear with me while I get this all resolved.}}

OctoPrint
== OctoPrint ==

OctoPrint is a 3D Printer Server.

== Printers ==

OctoPrint supports a large number of printers out of the box. the complete listing is provided : Link currently misplaced

== Installaion ==

The installation places files in the following locations 

===Cura===


Cura is a 3D slicing program which seems to have gone through three major architecture changes roughly coinciding with versions 0.15.X and 2.1.X.
OctoPrint (Currently 12.1) does not support the 2.1.X implementation and the EBuild locks in at the 0.15.6 version available in the gentoo repository.

=== User(s) and Group(s) ===

The OctoPrint manual recommends one should create an OctoPrint user and allow it access to the Serial and Terminal groups. Gentoo provides the tty group for terminal access but this is not really required by OctoPrint and there is no Serial group so instead the uucp group is specified in the EBuild.

=== Serial ===

The Arduino website discusses serial connection [http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All issues]. 
A User on the [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-907860-start-0.html Gentoo Forums] provides a more structured guide on resolving these.
