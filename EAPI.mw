'''EAPI''' is a version defined in [[Ebuild|ebuilds]] and other package manager related files which inform the package manager about the file syntax and content. It is, in effect, the version of the [[Package Manager Specification]] (PMS) that the file adheres to.

The EAPI versions (and their meaning) are defined in the Package Manager Specification. Currently, EAPIs 0 through 5 are defined and officially supported.
