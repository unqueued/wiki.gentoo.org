'''EAPI''' is [[Article description::a version defined in [[Ebuild|ebuilds]] and other package manager related files which informs the package manager about the file syntax and content.]]

The EAPI versions (and their meaning) are defined in the [[Package Manager Specification]] (PMS). Currently, EAPIs 0 through 7 are defined and officially supported. In the main Gentoo repository, EAPIs 0 to 4 are banned for new ebuilds, while 5 has been deprecated.
