'''EAPI is a version defined in [[Ebuild|ebuilds]] and other package manager related files which inform the package manager about the file syntax and content. It is, in effect, the version of the package manager specification ([[PMS]]) that the file adheres to.'''

The EAPI versions (and their meaning) are defined in the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/pms.xml Package Manager Specification]. Currently, EAPIs 0 through 4 are defined and officially supported.
