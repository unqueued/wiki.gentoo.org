The '''Yocto Project''' is a [[Linux Foundation]] workgroup  whose goal is to produce tools and processes that will enable the creation of [[Linux distribution]]s for [[embedded software]] that are independent of the underlying architecture of the embedded software itself. The project was announced by the Linux Foundation in 2010.<ref>[http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2011/03/yocto-project-aligns-technology-openembedded-and-gains-corporate-co Yocto Project Aligns Technology with OpenEmbedded and Gains Corporate Collaborators]</ref> In March 2011, the project aligned itself with [[OpenEmbedded]], an existing framework with similar goals, with the result being The OpenEmbedded-Core Project.

The ''Yocto Project'' is an [[open source]] project whose focus is on
improving the software development process for [[embedded Linux]]
distributions. The Yocto Project provides interoperable tools,
metadata, and processes that enable the rapid, repeatable development
of Linux-based [[embedded systems]].

== Project Scope ==

The Yocto Project has the aim and objective of attempting to
improve the lives of developers of customised [[Linux]] systems supporting
the [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PowerPC]] and [[x86]]/[[x86 64]] architectures. It is working
towards this by focusing on one set of great tools rather than
the several sets of mediocre ones that existed when the project was
founded.{{POV-Statement|1=Marketing speak|date=January 2013}} A key part of this is an open source build system, based around
the [[OpenEmbedded]] architecture, that enables developers to create their
own [[Linux distribution]] specific to their environment. This reference
implementation of OpenEmbedded is called Poky.

There are several other sub-projects under the project umbrella which
include [[EGLIBC]], pseudo, cross-prelink, eclipse integration, ADT/SDK, the
[[Matchbox (window manager)|matchbox]] suite of applications, and many others. One of the central
goals of the project is interoperability among these tools.

The project offers different sized targets from "tiny" to fully featured
images which are configurable and customisable by the end user. The
project encourages interaction with upstream projects and has
contributed heavily
to OpenEmbedded-Core and [[BitBake]] as well as to
numerous upstream projects, including the [[Linux kernel]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The resulting
images are typically useful in systems where embedded Linux would be
used, these being single-use focused systems or systems without the
usual screens/input devices associated with desktop Linux systems.

As well as building Linux systems, there is also an ability to generate
a toolchain for [[cross compilation]] and a [[Software Development Kit]] (SDK)
tailored to their own distribution, also referred to as the Application
Developer Toolkit (ADT). The project tries to be software and vendor
agnostic. Thus, for example, you can choose which package manager format you
intend to use ([[Deb (file format)|deb]], [[RPM Package Manager|rpm]], or ipk).

Within builds, there are options for various build-time
[[Regression test|sanity/regression tests]], and also the option to boot and test certain
images under [[QEMU]] to validate the build.

== Governance ==

The Yocto Project is one of the Labs collaborative software projects
at the [[Linux Foundation]].

The project's governance is divided loosely into
administrative and technical arms, although many members
participate in both camps.

At a technical level, the project is overseen by the project architect
Richard Purdie (a Linux Foundation Fellow) who has a long history of
involvement with many of the project's components and technologies. The
architect maintains a hierarchy of maintainers for the different
components of the system, much as the Linux kernel is maintained.

The administrative arm consists of an Advisory Board made up of
representatives from the project's member organizations, including
several major silicon vendors and software vendors as well as
representatives from groups such as software consultants and community
members. The member organizations of this board provide resources to
the project. There are also several Advisory Board working groups that
handle administrative functions for the project such as finance, infrastructure, advocacy
and outreach, and community management.
