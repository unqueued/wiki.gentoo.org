The '''Yocto Project''' [https://www.yoctoproject.org (https://www.yoctoproject.org)] is a Linux Foundation workgroup  whose goal is to produce tools and processes that will enable the creation of Linux distributions for embedded software that are independent of the underlying architecture of the embedded software itself. The project was announced by the Linux Foundation in 2010. [http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2011/03/yocto-project-aligns-technology-openembedded-and-gains-corporate-co Yocto Project Aligns Technology with OpenEmbedded and Gains Corporate Collaborators]. In March 2011, the project aligned itself with OpenEmbedded, an existing framework with similar goals, with the result being The OpenEmbedded-Core Project.

The ''Yocto Project'' is an open source project whose focus is on
improving the software development process for embedded Linux
distributions. The Yocto Project provides interoperable tools,
metadata, and processes that enable the rapid, repeatable development
of Linux-based embedded systems.<ref name="Yocto Project Wikipedia">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yocto_Project ''Yocto Project'' â€“ Wikipedia]</ref>


== Installation ==

=== Emerge packages ===

=== Optional make ===

Yocto needs make-3.82. Optional if yocto complains:
{{Cmd|<pre>WARNING: Host distribution "Gentoo" has not been validated with this version of the build system; you may possibly experience unexpected failures. It is recommended that you use a tested distribution.
ERROR:  OE-core's config sanity checker detected a potential misconfiguration.
    Either fix the cause of this error or at your own risk disable the checker (see sanity.conf).
    Following is the list of potential problems / advisories:

    Your version of make 3.82 is broken. Please revert to 3.81 or install a patched version.

ERROR: Execution of event handler 'check_sanity_eventhandler' failed
ERROR: Command execution failed: Exited with 1
</pre>}}


{{File| /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords ||<pre>
>=sys-devel/make-3.82
</pre>}}


There might be problems with some custom metas and eglibc/2.18-r0/eglibc-2.18. 

Try to install a highter make version for me it worked with make-4.0
{{File| /etc/portage/package.mask ||<pre>

=== Add sudo to user ===
{{RootCmd|<pre>groupadd sudo
usermod -a -G sudo user
su - -c "echo '%sudo   ALL=(ALL) ALL' > /etc/sudoers.d/yocto" 
</pre>}}
