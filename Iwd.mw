'''iwd''' ('''i'''Net '''W'''ireless '''D'''aemon) is [[Article description::an up-and-coming wireless daemon for Linux.]] It is written by [[:Category:Intel|Intel]] and aims to replace [[wpa_supplicant]].

= Installation =

== Kernel ==

{{KernelBox|1=
Security Options --->
	[*] Enable access key retention support
		[*] Diffie-Hellman operations on retained keys

Cryptographic API  --->
	[*] Diffie-Hellman algorithm
	[*] DES and Triple DES EDE cipher algorithms
	[*] User-space interface for symmetric key cipher algorithms
}}

== USE flags ==

{{USEflag|package=net-wireless/iwd}}

== Emerge ==

Install the {{Package|net-wireless/iwd}} package:
{{Emerge|net-wireless/iwd}}

= Network management =
Gentoo is all about choice, so there should be various methods available for [[Network_management#Available_software|network management]]. But iwd is new, and not methods support iwd fully. Be sure to heed the warning in the [[Network_management#Available_software|network management]] article about mixing and matching the different methods for network management.

== Netifrc ==
[[Netifrc]] is Gentoo's default method of managing networks, but unfortunately it does not support iwd as backend yet, see {{Bug|690808}}. Make sure that any symbolic links to {{Path|/etc/init.d/net.lo}} for the wireless interfaces are removed:
{{RootCmd
|rm -i /etc/init.d/net.wl*}}

Select another, working, method for network management.

== Dhcpcd ==
Add both the [[Network management using DHCPCD|dhcpcd]] and then iwd service to the default runlevel and start them up:
{{RootCmd
|rc-update add dhcpcd default
|rc-service dhcpcd start
|rc-update add iwd default
|rc-service iwd start}}

Use [[iwd#Connecting to an access point with iwctrl|iwctl]] to make connections.

== NetworkManager ==
[[NetworkManager]] supports iwd. Make sure to set the "iwd" USE flag:
{{RootCmd|echo "net-misc/networkmanager iwd" >> /etc/portage/package.use/zz-autounmask}}
{{Emerge|net-wireless/networkmanager -N}}

{{Package|Gnome-extra/nm-applet}} or other [//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkManager#Graphical_front-ends_and_command_line_interfaces NetworkManager frontends] can be used as per normal to make connections.

== Connman ==
Connman supports iwd somewhat. Make sure to set the "iwd" USE flag en (re-)emerge:
{{RootCmd|echo "net-misc/connman iwd" >> /etc/portage/package.use/zz-autounmask}}
{{Emerge|net-misc/connman -N}}

Connman still relies on wpa_supplicant for scanning, but connecting via iwd is possible.

= Connecting to an access point with iwctl =

{{c|iwctl}} is iwd's tool to control iwd. It supports both a command line interface and an interactive mode. A complete command line would be {{c|iwctl station list}} to see what adapters you might be able to use:

{{Cmd|iwctl station list|output=<pre>
                            Devices in Station Mode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                State          Scanning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  wlan0               disconnected
</pre>}}

An interactive session of {{c|iwctl}} commands can be used to connect to a WiFi network access point. First check the status of the WiFi network interface, set it in scanning mode if needed, and then obtain the list of WiFi access points. Finally connect to the access point.

{{Cmd|iwctl|output=<pre>
# station wlan0 show
                                 Station: wlan0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Settable  Property            Value
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Scanning            no
            State               disconnected

# station wlan0 scan
# station wlan0 get-networks
                               Available networks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Network name                    Security  Signal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FRITZ!Box 7362 SL               psk       ***
    WLAN-105127                     psk       *

# station wlan0 connect "FRITZ!Box 7362 SL"
Type the network passphrase for FRITZ!Box 7362 SL psk.
Passphrase:
</pre>}}

= Interface management =
Starting with version 0.18 iwd is actively managing network interfaces [//iwd.wiki.kernel.org/interface_lifecycle]. On startup it may destroy an existing network interface and create a new one. The newly created interface will be configured optimally for iwd's use. Note that currently interface renaming is not supported. This means that an interface that was detected by udev, and renamed to say 'wlp2s0' will be destroyed and a new one named for example 'wlan0' might be created. When iwd exists it destroys the wireless interface it created.
