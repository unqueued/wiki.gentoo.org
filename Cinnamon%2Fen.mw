Cinnamon is a contemporary desktop environment with a traditional interface that Gnome 2, [[LXDE]] or [[Xfce]] users will find easy to work with. Cinnamon has very good graphical and functional features. Forked from Gnome Shell and developed for [http://linuxmint.com/ Linux Mint], it is available for the {{Keyword|amd64}} and {{Keyword|x86}} architectures.

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===

Cinnamon works great both with and without systemd. To install without systemd dependencies, use {{c|eselect}} to switch to a profile without Gnome, such as <code>default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop</code>. To install with systemd, use a Gnome-enabled profile such as <code>default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome</code>. The architecture and version can be different in both cases.

To get a list of available system profiles:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile list|output=<pre>
[1] default/linux/amd64/13.0
[2] default/linux/amd64/13.0/selinux
[3] default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop
[4] default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome
[5] default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd
etc.
</pre>}}

==== OpenRC ====

When using OpenRC, set the right system profile:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop}}

It is also possible to use the associated profile number according to the profiles list above:

{{RootCmd|eselect profile set 3}}

Read up on the instructions available in the [[Gentoo_Without_systemd|Gentoo Without Systemd]] article.

==== Systemd ====

For Cinnamon with systemd support select the GNOME desktop profile ending in systemd:

{{RootCmd|eselect default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/gnome/systemd}}

{{Note|The system architecture (<code>amd64</code>) and version (<code>13</code>) can be different as long as the ending of the string is <code>/gnome/systemd</code>.}}

==== Xorg ====

Of course for Cinnamon to work [[Xorg/Guide|Xorg must be installed and configured]]. Make sure an X server is set up before proceeding with this article. If needed, test Xorg as detailed in the [[Xorg/Guide#Using_startx|Using startx]] section of the Xorg Gentoo guide.

Cinnamon (and other applications) are internationalized, supporting a number of languages (Linguas). If this was not done during the initial Gentoo installation, add the appropriate language value to the <var>LINGUAS</var> variable in {{Path|make.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|title=Set make.conf for French language code|1=
LINGUAS="fr" # or en, de, it, es, etc.
}}

It is advised to install {{Package|x11-libs/gtk+extra}} and {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting}} as it makes the Cinnamon experience more complete.

{{Emerge|x11-libs/gtk+extra x11-drivers/xf86-video-modesetting}}

Two USE flags, <code>icu</code> and <code>pulseaudio</code>, are needed by Cinnamon's dependencies. If they are not set already, either allow {{c|emerge}} to create or update {{Path|package.use}} (or {{Path|package.use/cinnamon}}) itself, or set the USE flags manually.

{{Note|The compilation duration for {{Package|net-libs/webkit-gtk}} can be very long, especially on older hardware. Be patient, Cinnamon is worth it!}}

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=gnome-extra/cinnamon|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|gnome-extra/cinnamon}}:
|networkmanager
|nls
|python_targets_python2_7+++Build with Python 2.7
|python_targets_python3_3+++Build with Python 3.3
|python_targets_python3_4+++Build with Python 3.4
}}

Find more information on Python targets by visiting the Python project's [[Project:Python/PYTHON_TARGETS|PYTHON TARGETS]] article.

=== Emerge ===

Finally, after performing all the steps above, ask Portage to emerge Cinnamon:

{{Emerge|gnome-extra/cinnamon}}

== System configuration ==

Before looking at the Cinnamon theming, configure the system to properly start Cinnamon at boot or upon user request, and enable the right privilege delegation settings so that end users can interact with the system in an intuitive manner.

=== Services ===

Xorg server and Cinnamon need the {{c|dbus}} and {{c|consolekit}} services. The next set of instructions show how to deal with OpenRC. With systemd use {{c|systemctl}} as detailed in the [[Systemd#Enabling.2C_disabling.2C_starting_and_stopping_services|systemd page]].

Make sure that the right services are started at system boot time:

{{RootCmd
|rc-update add dbus default
|rc-update add consolekit default
}}

Next, start the services (there is no need to restart the system):

{{RootCmd
|rc-service dbus start
|rc-service consolekit start
}}

[[NetworkManager]] is a Cinnamon dependency and is not needed if the network was configured during the initial Gentoo installation. It should not run concurrently with another network service. If NetworkManager is desired be sure to disable other network management programs or services before starting it. For example, if the system was originally configured to use Gentoo's netifrc scripts to manage the network connections, disable these network services:

{{RootCmd
|rc-service net.eth0 stop
|rc-update del net.eth0 default
}}

{{Note|When using {{Package|sys-fs/udev}} network interfaces will be using [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/ Predictable Network Interface Names] to name the active interfaces. This will produce names like <tt>enp12s0</tt>, <tt>eno1</tt>, <tt>enp2s0</tt>, etc. When using {{Package|sys-fs/eudev}}, the Gentoo udev fork avoiding systemd dependencies, the first network interface name is often still called <tt>eth0</tt>.}}

After removing the other network services, add NetworkManager:

{{RootCmd
|rc-service NetworkManager start
|rc-update add NetworkManager default
}}

=== Sudo ===

For an ordinary user to reboot or shutdown the system from Cinnamon, {{c|sudo}} is needed with some settings.

First install {{Package|app-admin/sudo}}:

{{Emerge|app-admin/sudo}}

Next modify the {{c|sudo}} configuration with the {{c|visudo}} command:

{{RootCmd|visudo}}

Visudo runs the default text editor to generate or update a {{Path|sudoers}} file. Replace <code>username</code> in the text below with the username of each user that will be using Cinnamon:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sudoers|lang=bash|1=
username  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
username  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt
username  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff
username  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
}}

Or for the <tt>wheel</tt> group:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sudoers|lang=bash|1=
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff
%wheel  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
}}

=== Polkit rules and actions ===

For an ordinary user to perform additional highly privileged actions from Cinnamon, policy kit must be configured. Use {{c|pkaction}} to get a list of actions; the names should be self-explanatory:

{{RootCmd|pkaction|output=<pre>
org.cinnamon.settings-daemon.plugins.power.backlight-helper
org.cinnamon.settings-users
org.cinnamon.settingsdaemon.datetimemechanism.configure
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Contacts
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Control
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Device.Control
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Firmware
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Location
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Messaging
org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.USSD
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.enable-disable-network
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.enable-disable-wifi
etc.
</pre>}}

The simplest way is to authorize all actions by only testing <tt>wheel</tt> group membership. Put a JavaScript file in {{Path|/etc/polkit-1/rules.d}}, named for example {{Path|55-allowing-all-actions.rules}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/55-allowing-all-actions.rules|lang=javascript|title=Setting general polkit rule|1=
polkit.addRule (function (action, subject)
{
  if (subject.isInGroup ("wheel"))
  {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});
}}

To only authorize some actions, the action names must be iterated. For a <tt>wheel</tt> group user to suspend, hibernate, shutdown and restart the system, make a {{Path|55-allowing-actions.rules}} file like so:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/55-allowing-actions.rules|lang=javascript|title=Setting polkit rules|1=
polkit.addRule (function (action, subject)
{
  if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate" {{!}}{{!}}
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.upower.suspend" {{!}}{{!}}
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop" {{!}}{{!}}
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart" &&
      subject.isInGroup ("wheel"))
      {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
      }
});
}}
Various actions can be added: those to change color profiles, use Nemo (Cinnamon files manager) as root, mount and eject media, set screen backlight, use network manager, change wallpaper, etc. Several <code>polkit.addRule (function (action, subject){&nbsp;â€¦&nbsp;});</code> blocks can be used next to each other as well.

{{Important|{{Path|/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-default.rules}} already exists. Newly created file names should begin with '''55''' so they are processed after the {{Path|50-default.rules}} file. Do not make a file which would be processed before it, for instance one beginning with '''45'''.
}}

=== Starting Cinnamon ===

When not using a login/display manager, make a {{Path|.xinitrc}} file in the user's home directory:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|title=Cinnamon launch directive|1=
exec cinnamon-session
}}

Then to start Xorg and Cinnamon, execute {{c|startx}} after logging in:

{{Cmd|startx}}

With a display manager follow the [[display manager]] instructions.

== Theming ==

=== Mint-X icons ===

By default Cinnamon comes with Gnome icons. [https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-x-icons Mint-X icons are on GitHub]. Download, unzip, and put the Mint-X icon set in {{Path|/usr/share/icons}}:

{{RootCmd|mv pathToUnzippedArchive/mint-x-icons-master/usr/share/icons/Mint-X /usr/share/icons/Mint-X}}

Next, make a cache for it:

{{RootCmd|gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/Mint-X}}

The new icon set can be selected in Cinnamon Control Center. Mint-X icons are green, but other icon sets with different colors can be installed too, like Mint-X-Grey or Mint-X-Orange. Make sure to create a cache for these as well.

{{Important|Always install the Mint-X icon set with at least one colored icon set as it relies on it.}}

=== Desktop icons text color ===

An icon's text color in Cinnamon desktop is black by default, which is not always readable. The instructions to change this color depends on the GTK+ 3 version that the system is using. Get the currently used version with:

{{Cmd|emerge --info x11-libs/gtk+}}

* In GTK+ versions less than 3.13.3, this setting can only be changed system-wide. Change the text color by adding CSS rules to the {{Path|/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-3.0/gtk.css}} file (Adwaita is the default theme coming with GTK+), after the <code>@import</code> line:

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-3.0/gtk.css|lang=css|title=CSS rules for GTK+ &lt; 3.13.3|1=
@import url("resource:///org/gnome/adwaita/gtk-main.css");
 
/* added css rules */
.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item {
  color: #fff;  /* #fff is white web color indication, #333 should be dark grey */
}
 
.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item:selected {
  background-color: alpha (#fff, 0.2);  /* 0.2 is transparency level */
}
}}

: The 2<sup>nd</sup> rule concerns the selected desktop icon and can be modified to get another background color or set the transparency.

* In more recent GTK+ versions (3.13.3 onward), this must be tuned through a user-specific configuration file. Adwaita is now included in GTK+ as the theme replacing Raleigh, so rules must be set in the user's home directories. The file to edit is {{Path|~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css}}, and the change is now without the <code>@import</code> line. Additionally in this example, the left Nemo side bar is gray colored:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css|lang=css|title=CSS rules for GTK+ &ge; 3.13.3|1=
.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item {
  color: #fff;
}
 
.nemo-desktop.nemo-canvas-item:selected {
  background-color: alpha (#fff, 0.2);
}
 
NemoWindow .sidebar, NemoWindow .sidebar .view {
  background-color: #444;
  color: #eee; /* light grey */
}
}}

=== Mint-X themes ===

Cinnamon comes with a default cinnamon theme, obviously... The Mint-X themes are [https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-themes available for download] on GitHub. Download them, unzip, and copy to {{Path|/usr/share/themes}} if needed. They can be selected in the Cinnamon Control Center.

=== Playing with themes ===

Almost all theme settings can be changed in the {{Path|cinnamon.css}} file in the theme directory.

For example with the Cinnamon theme, which is not in {{Path|/usr/share/themes}} but in {{Path|/usr/share/cinnamon/theme}}, first copy the theme's directory to a user {{Path|.themes}} sub-directory, named for example {{Path|other-cinnamon}}, which will be the new theme name:

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /home/userName/.themes/other-cinnamon
|cp -R /usr/share/cinnamon/theme /home/userName/.themes/other-cinnamon/cinnamon
|chown -R userName:userName /home/userName/.themes/other-cinnamon
}}

Edit {{Path|~/.themes/other-cinnamon/cinnamon/cinnamon.css}}. The results of the changes can be viewed immediately by selecting another theme then reselecting the theme being changed.

== Common applications ==

=== Terminals ===

* {{Package|lxde-base/lxterminal}} - Requires no dependencies.
* {{Package|x11-terms/xfce4-terminal}} - Requires some dependencies but is better featured than {{Path|lxterminal}}.
* {{Package|x11-terms/gnome-terminal}} Requires systemd.

=== Other popular applications ===

A number of popular applications are available as well, often built for Gnome but working flawlessly in Cinnamon.

* standard calculator ({{Package|gnome-extra/gnome-calculator}})
* screen copy utility ({{Package|media-gfx/gnome-screenshot}})
* image viewer ({{Package|media-gfx/eog}})
* PDF reader ({{Package|app-text/evince}})
* system monitor ({{Package|gnome-extra/gnome-system-monitor}})
* archive manager ({{Package|app-arch/file-roller}})
* disk burning ({{Package|app-cdr/brasero}})
* text editor ({{Package|app-editors/gedit}})

{{Emerge|gnome-extra/gnome-calculator media-gfx/gnome-screenshot media-gfx/eog app-text/evince gnome-extra/gnome-system-monitor app-arch/file-roller app-cdr/brasero app-editors/gedit}}

== Troubleshooting ==

If problems occur, try to get access to the live error messages. These can be displayed on a separate (virtual) terminal or in a log file. If the messages cannot be found, try starting Cinnamon from the command line rather than through a display manager. Alternatively have a look at {{Path|/var/log/Xorg.0.log}}.

When the error or warning messages are not sufficient to troubleshoot Cinnamon, start it with the <code>--debug</code> parameter:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|title=Cinnamon debug launch|1=
exec cinnamon-session --debug
}}

If Cinnamon cannot launch, deleting (or renaming) {{Path|.cinnamon}} in the home directory is not enough: other Cinnamon or Gnome items must be deleted (or renamed) too before X restarts. These can be found in the XDG directories {{Path|.cache}}, {{Path|.config}} and {{Path|.local}}. {{Path|.gnome2}} can be deleted (or renamed) entirely.
