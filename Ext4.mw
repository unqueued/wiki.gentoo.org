'''ext4''' is an open source disk [[filesystem]] and the most recent version of the ext series.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel option:
{{KernelBox|1=
File systems  --->
    <*> The Extended 4 (ext4) filesystem
}}

If you have large disks (2 TB or larger), and are '''not''' using a 64-bit kernel, also enable the following option:

{{KernelBox|1=
-*- Enable the block layer  --->
    [*]   Support for large (2TB+) block devices and files
}}

=== Software ===
{{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}} contains the utilities to work with the filesystem. It's part of the ''system'' set and so already installed on your system.

You can change the USE flags:
{{USEflag
|nls+yes
}}
After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Usage ==

=== Creation ===

{{Warning|The <code>mkfs.ext4</code> command irreversibly destroys any content of the partition it is told to format. Please be sure to select the right partition.}}

To create an ext4 filesystem on the {{Path|/dev/sda1}} partition:
{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1}}
Please replace {{Path|/dev/sda1}} with the actual partition you want to format.

By default, 5% of available disk space is reserved for the root user. This is usually a good thing for the partition where the {{Path|/}} directory is mounted, but it may be not desiderable on other partitions. If you don't want to reserve disk space for the root user you can use the <code>-m 0</code> option:
{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 -m 0 /dev/sda1}}

=== Mount ===
You can mount the filesystems in several ways:
* [[mount]] - Manual mount.
* [[fstab]] - Automatic mount at boot time.
* [[removable media]] - Automatic mount at demand.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on access.
