    [*]   Support for large (2TB+) block devices and files

=== Software ===
{{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}} contains the utilities to work with the filesystem. It's part of the ''system'' set and so already installed on your system.

You can change the USE flags:
{{USEflag
|nls+yes
}}
After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Usage ==

=== Creation ===
To create an ext4 filesystem:
{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX#}}
Exchange ''/dev/sdX#'' with the right device file.

=== Mount ===
You can mount the filesystems in several ways:
* [[mount]] - Manual mount.
* [[fstab]] - Automatic mount at boot time.
* [[removable media]] - Automatic mount at demand.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on access.
