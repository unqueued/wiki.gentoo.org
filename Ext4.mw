==== Large drive support ====

When the system has large disks (2 TB or greater) and a 32-bit (x86) kernel is being used, the following option must be enabled:

{{KernelBox|1=
-*- Enable the block layer  --->
    [*]   Support for large (2TB+) block devices and files
}}

=== USE flags ===

The {{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}} package contains the utilities to work with the filesystem. In Gentoo Linux {{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}} is part of the ''system'' set and should be already installed on the system.

{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/e2fsprogs|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|sys-fs/e2fsprogs}}:
|nls+yes
}}

=== Emerge ===

After setting the USE flag update the system so the changes take effect:

{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Usage ==

=== Creation ===

{{Warning|The <tt>mkfs.ext4</tt> command irreversibly destroys any content of the partition it is told to format. Be sure to select the right partition!}}

To create an ext4 filesystem on the {{Path|/dev/sda1}} partition:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1}}

Please replace {{Path|/dev/sda1}} with the actual partition to format.

By default, 5% of available disk space is reserved for the <tt>root</tt> user. This is usually a good thing for the partition where the {{Path|/}} directory is mounted, but it may be not desirable on other partitions. To lose reserve disk space for the root user use <tt>mkfs.ext4</tt>'s <code>-m 0</code> option:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 -m 0 /dev/sda1}}

=== Mount ===

[[Filesystem|Filesystems]] can be mounted in several ways:

* <tt>[[mount]]</tt> - The mounting command used to manually mount filesystems.
* [[fstab|{{Path|/etc/fstab}}]] - The normal method for automatic mounting of filesytems at boot time.
* [[Removable media]] - Automatic mount on file demand.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on file access.
