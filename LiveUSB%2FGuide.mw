This HOWTO explains how to create a Gentoo Linux LiveUSB or, in other words, how to emulate an x86 or AMD64 Gentoo Linux LiveCD using a USB flash drive.

{{Note|For the Live'''DVD''' there is a simpler way: copy the DVD iso file to a UFD using dd.<br />
(If you're starting from ms-windows, get dd.exe from www.chrysocome.net/dd.)}}

== Introduction ==

=== The LiveUSB ===

This HOWTO explains how to create a ''Gentoo Linux LiveUSB'' or, in other words, how to emulate an x86 or AMD64 Gentoo Linux LiveCD using a USB flash drive. This is particularly useful for installing Gentoo Linux on a modern laptop with no CD-ROM drive. 

{{Note|The <code>sys-boot/unetbootin</code> package provides a much easier alternative to create a bootable USB stick from any bootable CD image.}}

Although the instructions found in this document aim at emulating a Gentoo Linux LiveCD using a USB flash drive, they should work for any arbitrary block device as long as you adjust the device names accordingly. 

=== Prerequisites ===

In order to use a Gentoo Linux LiveUSB you need the following: 

* Bootable USB flash drive with at least 1GB
* i686 or x86_64 computer with support for booting from USB

You will also need access to the following for creating the LiveUSB: 

* A computer running Gentoo Linux (or alternatively another Linux distribution)

== Preparing the USB flash drive ==

=== Partitioning the drive ===

{{Warning|These instructions will erase all data from the USB flash drive. Make sure to backup your data first.}}

{{Important|This HOWTO assumes that the {{Path|/dev/sdc}} device node corresponds to your USB flash drive. If you have other SCSI-like devices make sure to use the correct device node.}}

Create a FAT16 partition on your USB flash drive and mark it bootable using <code>fdisk</code> . An example partitioning scheme can be seen below: 

{{Note|If your key is 4GB or larger, use partition type <code>b</code> (W95 FAT32).}}

{{RootCmd|fdisk -l /dev/sdc|output=<pre>
Disk /dev/sdc: 2063 MB, 2063597056 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 250 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
  
   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdc1   *           1         250     2008124+   6  FAT16
</pre>
}}

=== Creating the filesystem ===

Create a FAT16 filesystem on the USB flash drive using <code>mkdosfs</code> : 

{{Note|If your key is 4GB or larger, use <code>-F 32</code> to create a FAT32 filesystem.}}

{{Emerge|sys-fs/dosfstools}}

{{RootCmd|mkdosfs -F 16 /dev/sdc1|output=<pre>
mkfs.fat 3.0.22 (2013-07-19)
</pre>
}}

=== Installing a Master Boot Record ===

Install the precompiled Master Boot Record (MBR) from <code>syslinux</code> on the USB flash drive: 

{{Emerge|--verbose sys-boot/syslinux}}

{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/usr/share/syslinux/mbr.bin of{{=}}/dev/sdc|output=<pre>
0+1 records in
0+1 records out
440 bytes (440 B) copied, 0.00522668 s, 84.2 kB/s
</pre>
}}

== Copying the files to your key ==

=== Mounting the Gentoo Linux Installation CD ===

Download the Gentoo Weekly Minimal Install CD for your architecture from your local Gentoo Linux [http://www.gentoo.org//main/en/where.xml mirror] site and mount the ISO image on {{Path|/mnt/cdrom}} as shown below: 

{{Code|Mounting the Gentoo Linux Installation CD ISO image|<pre>
## (Create the /mnt/cdrom mount point if needed)
# mkdir -p /mnt/cdrom
# mount -o loop,ro -t iso9660 /path/to/iso.iso /mnt/cdrom
</pre>
}}

{{Note|If you receive a ''Could not find any loop device'' error message when mounting the iso, you need to enable the <code>Loopback device support</code> option in your kernel configuration.}}

=== Mounting the LiveUSB ===

Mount the newly formatted USB flash drive on {{Path|/mnt/usb}} as shown below: 

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /mnt/usb
|mount -t vfat /dev/sdc1 /mnt/usb}}

=== Copying the files ===

Copy the files from the Gentoo Linux Installation CD to the LiveUSB. The files need to be reordered a bit as we will be using the <code>syslinux</code> bootloader instead of <code>isolinux</code> : 

{{RootCmd|cp -r /mnt/cdrom/* /mnt/usb
|mv /mnt/usb/isolinux/* /mnt/usb
|mv /mnt/usb/isolinux.cfg /mnt/usb/syslinux.cfg
|rm -rf /mnt/usb/isolinux*
|mv /mnt/usb/memtest86 /mnt/usb/memtest}}

You can now unmount the ISO image: 

{{RootCmd|umount /mnt/cdrom}}

=== Adjusting the bootloader configuration ===

Adjust the syslinux configuration file using <code>sed</code> as shown below. The <code>slowusb</code> parameter will introduce some extra delays before attempting to mount the filesystem. This is needed to allow the USB flash drive to settle upon detection. 

{{RootCmd|sed -i -e "s:cdroot:cdroot slowusb:" -e "s:kernel memtest86:kernel memtest:" /mnt/usb/syslinux.cfg}}

== Installing a bootloader ==

=== Unmounting the drive ===

Make sure you unmount the USB flash drive before installing the bootloader: 

{{RootCmd|umount /mnt/usb}}

=== Installing syslinux ===

Finally install the <code>syslinux</code> bootloader on the USB flash drive: 

{{RootCmd|syslinux /dev/sdc1}}

{{Important|You will need to rerun <code>syslinux /dev/sdc1</code> each time you modify the {{Path|syslinux.cfg}} file for the configuration changes to take affect.}}

{{Note|If this is the first time you have used syslinux, you will need to edit {{Path|/etc/mtools/mtools.conf}} on your host. Simply commenting out <code>SAMPLE FILE</code> will suffice for the purpose of this guide.}}

== Using the LiveUSB ==

=== Booting ===

Insert the USB flash drive and turn on the computer, making sure the BIOS is set to boot from USB. If all goes well you should be presented with a standard syslinux prompt. 

You should be able to follow the generic installation instructions found in the [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo Handbook] from here on.
