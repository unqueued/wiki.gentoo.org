Glowing Bear is a web frontend for WeeChat 0.4.2 and higher (older WeeChat versions are incompatible). Although the [http://www.glowing-bear.org/ main site] can be used to security connect to a WeeChat relay, it is also possible to host Glowing Bear from a home server. This guide will walk users through the process of setting up a local Glowing Bear instance on Gentoo Linux.

{{Note|Because this guide covers aspects of configuration that are not the same for every user, additional research on certain concepts may be required. Most technically savvy users (the normal Gentoo crowd) should not have to research much in order to complete this guide.}}

__TOC__

== Concepts ==

Some knowledge on following topics will be needed in order to complete this guide:

* [[WeeChat]] - As expected, WeeChat is the base Glowing Bear will connect to. Without it this guide is meaningless.
* Web servers - There are a few choices here: [[Apache]], [[Lighttpd]], or [[Nginx]]. Any one of them will get the job done.
* [[Git]] - Git is version control software. It is the primary means of obtaining and then maintaining a local copy of Glowing Bear.
* Domain name management (optional) - Used to forward information computer looking the local Glowing Bear copy that is behind a firewall.

== Introduction ==

WeeChat, the back end that Glowing Bear will connect to, can be hosted locally or by another server on the network. For serious IRC users, yes, they do exist, being on IRC ''all'' the time is a must. For more information concerning the IRC user mindset check out the [[IRC]] article.

== Configuration ==

=== Setting up WeeChat ===

The first step in this process is setting up WeeChat. If this step is not performed the rest of this article will not be of much practical use. If necessary run through the official WeeChat quick start guide before continuing. 

Once user information has been configured, WeeChat will need to be set as a relay in order for Glowing Bear to connect. Run the following commands from within a running WeeChat instance to set a relay password and instruct the relay to run on port <code>9001</code>:

{{GenericCmd
|/set relay.network.password <password>
|/relay add weechat 9001
}}

Be sure to replace <code><password></code> in the first command with a non-guessable password. This is important for ensuring safe usage.

=== The web server ===

Setting up the web server is the most difficult portion of this guide. Thankfully there are other articles that have been written to handle this seemingly monstrous task. For a the speediest setup lighttpd is recommended. Glowing Bear does not need a large, dependency heavy HTTP server in order to present a bit of HTML and javascript.

Travel over to the [[Lighttpd]] article if further instructions are needed on setting up a simple web server.

=== Gitting Glowing Bear ===

Now that the web server is ready to rock and roll a simple git clone is needed to pull the Glowing Bear sources from the hosting service to the server's default HTTP directory.

{{RootCmd|git clone }}
