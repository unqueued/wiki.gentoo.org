WeeChat is a light, extensible, actively maintained, well documented, highly featured [[IRC]] client. WeeChat natively runs through ncurses in a text mode interface, however for user convenience many remote interfaces (GUIs) are available to relay WeeChat data to more accessible locations (Android phones, Web interfaces, and more).

=== Emerge ===

{{Note|Version 0.4.3-r1 of WeeChat is currently broken. Developers will probably not fix it since it is an older release. For this reason using an unstable (<code>~</code>) version of WeeChat is required. See {{Bug|544998}} for more information.}}

In order to successfully install WeeChat Portage will need permission to install an unstable version of the package:

{{RootCmd|echo "net-irc/weechat ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}

Now that Portage has permission to use unstable versions of WeeChat, <tt>emerge</tt> it:

{{Emerge|net-irc/weechat}}

== Configuration ==

An ''excellent'' [https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_quickstart.en.html quick start guide] can be found on WeeChat's website. The official guide should be followed for the most up to date configuration instructions. Head over there and read the guide. When finished return here if necessary for further instructions.

=== Auto-join channels ===

After making it through step 7 in the [https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_quickstart.en.html WeeChat quick start guide] Freenode ''should'' be added as the server. Custom channels can be automatically joined each time WeeChat is opened by running the following command inside the WeeChat client:

{{GenericCmd|/set irc.server.freenode.autojoin "#gentoo,#gentoo-chat"}}

This should add the {{IRC|gentoo}} and {{IRC|gentoo-chat}} channels to the auto-join list each time <tt>weechat</tt> starts. Add or subtract more more channels to the comma separated list as desired. Everyone has their own channels interests!

=== Adding a relay ===

In order to use remote interfaces, WeeChat needs to be configured as a relay.

{{GenericCmd|/relay add weechat <port_number>}}

Next set the password for the relay:

{{GenericCmd|/set relay.network.password <password>}}

=== Remote interfaces ===

The following remote interfaces are available:

* [http://www.glowing-bear.org/ Glowing Bear] - A web frontend for WeeChat. See the [[/Glowing Bear Guide|Glowing Bear Guide]] for hosting Glowing Bear on Gentoo.
* [https://weechat.org/download/devel/ QWeeChat] - A Qt interface for WeeChat.
* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid WeeChat Android] - Only works on Android phones. Simply download the application from the Google Play Store and get started!
* [https://github.com/the-kenny/weechat.el Emacs] - A weird emacs thing.
* [https://github.com/eirikb/weecloud WeeCloud] - A WeeChat client written in javascript.

Each remote interface has a unique setup. Not all of the clients available in the list above may be operational. Glowing Bear is probably the most tested of the bunch. When in doubt try [[/Glowing Bear Guide|Glowing Bear]] first.

== Usage ==

It is common for many text-mode IRC client users to run the clients on a system that is always on always connected to the internet. This make it possible to never miss a mention or a message. Like most command-line programs, <tt>weechat</tt> will run all the time if opened in a <tt>[[screen]]</tt> or a <tt>[[tmux]]</tt> session which is then detached. This is currently the ideal method for staying connected to IRC networks continuously.

=== screen ===

Open <tt>screen</tt> using the following command:

{{Cmd|screen -t weechat}}

After <tt>weechat</tt> is configured press {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|a}} to enter ''Command Mode'' and then {{Key|d}} to detach from the <tt>screen</tt> session. It can be re-attached to later by running:

{{Cmd|screen -ls}}

To list the currently running sessions and then entering:

{{Cmd|screen -r <session>}}

Where <code><session></code> is a weird, crazy string.

For additional information on how to use <tt>screen</tt> visit the [[screen|<tt>screen</tt> article]].

=== tmux ===

Simply open <tt>tmux</tt> using the following command:

{{Cmd|tmux new -s weechat}}

By default a green status stripe should be visible near the bottom of the terminal. This is an indicator that <tt>tmux</tt> is running. Start <tt>weechat</tt>:

{{Cmd|weechat}}

After <tt>weechat</tt> has been configured, disconnect from the session by using {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|b}} and then press {{Key|d}} to detach.

In order to reconnect to the <tt>tmux</tt> session that is running (which was titled "<tt>weechat</tt>") issue:

{{Cmd|tmux a -t weechat}}

For additional information on how to use <tt>tmux</tt> visit the [[tmux|<tt>tmux</tt> article]].
