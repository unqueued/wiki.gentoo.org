|Ebuid Upstream Scanner|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
euscan (Ebuild Upstream Scanner) is an utility to check if an ebuild
have new upstream version. It was designed to provide the same
features as debian's uscan and DEHS (http://dehs.alioth.debian.org/).
euscan is also a web interface that aggregates the result of euscan
ran on all gentoo ebuilds (currently hosted at
http://euscan.iksaif.net but will move to gentoo.org someday). There
are a lot of things to do on euscan, here are some examples:

==== Celery port ====
Currently euscan use shell scripts and GNU parallel to scan the
portage tree. Using celery (a python task queue that integrates well
with django) would allow a more flexible scan process. Scanning the
tree or a package could be done with a simple django command starting
a celery task, the web interface could rescan old packages on-demand
too. While adding celery commands, it would be great to add simple
commands to: create the local filesytem needed by euscan,
add/sync/remove an overlay, etc...
Celery is not really packaged for gentoo, but I got some ebuilds in my
overlay, so another side of the project could be to push them to the portage
tree.

==== Version Detection Enhancements ====
euscan currently use multiple heuristics to determine upstream
version, but there is a lot to do to enhance that to remove false
positive and be able to scan more package:
* create a script to gather statistics on euscan success and failure and use methods.
* use metadata.xml's <upstream><remote-id> tag with the appropriate euscan site-handler (pypi, pearl, cpan, etc...) and make sure that all packages have this tag correctly set in the portage tree
* create a new metadata tag <upstream><watch> that works like debian/watch and make euscan use it. Create a script to import informations from the associated debian/watch file.
* steal ideas from other tools (uscan, portscout) and use other source of data (youri, distrowatch, distromatch, whoas; Equivalent-Packages)

==== Euscan Web enhancements ====
Add an account system, and allow maintainer to register to subscribe
to automatic weekly notifications. Integrate euscan with other webapps
like http://portage.gentoo.org, http://znurt.org/,
http://gpo.zugaina.org/, http://soc.dev.gentoo.org/gentoostats and try
to create a single killer webapp . Add better overlay support and
tweak django administration.
