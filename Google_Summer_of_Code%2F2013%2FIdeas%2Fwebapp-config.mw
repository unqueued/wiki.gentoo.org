==== Django and RoR support for webapp-config ====
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
webapp-config is a tool that is used for installation of web applications. Amongst its features, it offers multiple installations of the same web application in separate directories/vhosts, upgrade of the web application and cleanup. It works well for PHP web applications, but has no support for Django and Ruby on Rails web applications

The goal of this project is to make webapp-config fully support Django and Ruby on Rails web applications the same way it does for PHP ones. The webapp eclass may also need some work.
