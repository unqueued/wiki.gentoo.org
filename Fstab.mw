The '''fstab''' ('''f'''ile '''s'''ystem '''tab'''le) file ({{Path|/etc/fstab}}) is a configuration file that is used to configure how and where the main [[filesystem]]s are [[mount]]ed, especially at boot time.

== Syntax ==
Each line of the fstab contains the necessary settings to mount one partition, drive or network share.  The line has six columns, separated by whitespaces or tabs. The columns are as follows:
# The [[device file]], [[#UUID, label|UUID or label]] or other means of locating the partition or data source.
# The mount point, where the data is to be attached to the filesystem.
# The filesystem type.
# Options, including if the filesystem should be mounted at boot.
# Adjusts the archiving schedule for the partition (used by {{Package|app-arch/dump}}). ''0'' disables, ''1'' enables the feature.
# Controls the order in which fsck checks the device/partition for errors at boot time. The root device should be ''1''. Other partitions should be either ''2'' (to check after root) or ''0'' (to disable checking for that partition altogether).

An example for the root device:
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
/dev/sda1   /   ext4   defaults   1   2
</pre>}}

=== UUID, label ===
Instead of device files you can use persistent [[device file#UUID, label|UUIDs and labels]]:
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
UUID="339df6e7-91a8-4cf9-a43f-7f7b3db533c6"   /   ext4   defaults   1   2
LABEL="Gentoo"   /   ext4   defaults   1   2
</pre>}}

== Services ==
The following [[OpenRC]] services read the fstab to mount or manage the filesystems.
* '''localmount'''- Mount disks and swap according to fstab.
* '''netmount''' - Mount network shares according to fstab.
* '''fsck''' - Check and repair filesystems according to fstab.
* '''root''' - Mount the root filesystem read/write.

These services supplement the fstab, if the filesystems are not explicit stated:
* '''sysfs''' - Mount the {{Path|/sys}} filesystem.
* '''devfs''' - Mount system critical filesystems in {{Path|/dev}}.

Check that they are enabled to start at boot time:
{{RootCmd|rc-update show}}

== See also ==
* [[mount]] - Manual mount.
* [[removable media]] - Automatic mount at demand.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on access.
