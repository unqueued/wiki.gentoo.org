The '''fstab''' ('''f'''ile '''s'''ystem '''tab'''le) file ({{Path|/etc/fstab}}) is [[Article description::a configuration file that is used to configure how and where the main [[filesystem]]s are to be [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mtab mounted], especially at boot time.]]

== Syntax ==

Each line of {{Path|/etc/fstab}} contains the necessary settings to mount one partition, drive or network share.  The line has six columns, separated by whitespaces or tabs. The columns are as follows:

# The [[device file]], [[#UUIDs and labels|UUID or label]] or other means of locating the partition or data source.
# The mount point, where the data is to be attached to the filesystem.
# The filesystem type.
# Options, including if the filesystem should be mounted at boot.
# Adjusts the archiving schedule for the partition (used by {{Package|app-arch/dump}}). ''0'' disables, ''1'' enables the feature.
# Controls the order in which fsck checks the device/partition for errors at boot time. The root device should be ''1''. Other partitions should be either ''2'' (to check after root) or ''0'' (to disable checking for that partition altogether).

An example for the root device:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|1=
/dev/sda1   /   ext4   defaults   0   1
}}

For more detailed information see {{c|man 5 fstab}}.

== UUIDs and labels ==

In the first column, a [[wikipedia:Universally unique identifier|UUID]] can be used instead of a device file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|title=Using a UUID for the root partition|1=
UUID=339df6e7-91a8-4cf9-a43f-7f7b3db533c6   /   ext4   defaults   0   1
}}

Alternatively, a LABEL can be used:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|title=Using a label for the root partition|1=
LABEL=Gentoo   /   ext4   defaults   0   1
}}

Please read [[Removable media#UUIDs and labels|this]] for details on how to retrieve UUIDs and labels.

== Services ==

The following [[OpenRC]] services read the fstab to mount or manage the filesystems:

* '''localmount'''- Mount disks and swap according to fstab.
* '''netmount''' - Mount network shares according to fstab.
* '''fsck''' - Check and repair filesystems according to fstab.
* '''root''' - Mount the root filesystem read/write.

These services supplement the fstab, if the filesystems are not explicitly stated:

* '''sysfs''' - Mount the {{Path|/sys}} filesystem.
* '''devfs''' - Mount system critical filesystems in {{Path|/dev}}.

Check that they are enabled to start at boot time:

{{RootCmd|rc-update show}}
