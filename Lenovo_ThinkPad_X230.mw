=== TrackPoint Scrolling ===

When using {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev}}, scrolling with the TrackPoint can be enabled via {{Package|x11-apps/xinput}} and the following settings:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
xinput set-prop "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint" "Evdev Wheel Emulation" 1
xinput set-prop "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint" "Evdev Wheel Emulation Button" 2
xinput set-prop "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint" "Evdev Wheel Emulation Timeout" 200
xinput set-prop "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint" "Evdev Wheel Emulation Axes" 6 7 4 5
xinput set-prop "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint" "Device Accel Constant Deceleration" 0.95
}}

Then press down the middle button and move the TrackPoint in the scrolling direction. It works vertically and horizontally.
