== Pre-Introduction ==
This is a copy of copy from the original gentoo-wiki. I wrote the article over on the gentoo-wiki.com which was pretty much a complete rewrite from the 'old' gentoo-wiki that only exists as a backup of some sorts now.
As I am currently in the process of installing a new e-mail server, these instructions will be changed and updated where needed and hopefully thus accurate. Parts I am not configuring or not using will be stubs for someone else to fill in hopefully.

== Original-Introduction ==
Wow, when I started this HOWTO, it was going to be a simple extension of the "Virtual Mailhosting System with Postfix Guide" written by Ken Nowack and Ezra Gorman. All I was going to do is change from MySQL to PostgreSQL, how much of a problem could that be?

After many hours of effort, about 8000 different configuration variations and having to try to read hints and tips from pages in almost every language you can imagine, I finally have it (Phew!). I have made every effort to validate that this configuration is correct but cannot guarantee it 100%, however it was close enough to get me running and believe me, I am no Linux expert.

Because this document is so long (over 100 pages in a4 paper format!), I have broken it into a number of sections in the hopes that it will be more manageable. Enjoy!


== So What do I Get? ==
The purpose of this HOWTO is to establish a virtual mail system that can handle multiple domains with a variety of different interface options. This is not intended to be used by the average user who is looking for a mail client, this is a full-scale Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) intended for individuals who are hosting their own domains and/or need to provide support for virtual domains.

By the end of this HOWTO, you will have an easy method to manage a mail server that supports:
* Web based system administration
* Unlimited number of domains
* Virtual mail users without the need for shell accounts
* Domain (specific) user names
* Mailbox quotas
* Web access to email accounts
* IMAP and (very optional)POP3 support
* SMTP Authentication for secure relaying
* SSL for transport layer security
* Strong SPAM filtering
* Anti-Virus filtering
* Log Analysis
The real plus is that all of this is managed by a single database.


== Getting Started ==
=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/System_Setup_and_Packages|System Setup and Packages]] ===
This section outlines a system setup (a multi-server implementation) as well as the core packages that were used. This is a MUST READ before reading on any further (don't worry, it's short).


== Basic Setup ==
=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/Linux_vmail_user|Linux 'vmail' user]] ===
Mailboxes are stored on a normal filesystem and thus needs a user and group for security.

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/Admin_Support_Systems|Admin Support Systems]] ===
{{package|www-apps/postfixadmin}} and {{package|www-servers/apache}} were key tools in getting through testing and getting this to hang together. While the details of an Apache/PHP setup are not here, there is good information in here all the same.
