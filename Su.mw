The '''{{c|su}}''' ('''s'''ubstitute '''u'''ser) command can be used to impersonate other users on the system. {{c|su}} is provided by the {{Package|sys-apps/shadow}} package. It is also included with the {{Package|sys-apps/util-linux}} package, but it is disabled in the ebuild to prevent a file collision with {{Package|sys-apps/shadow}}.

__TOC__

== Usage ==

{{c|su}} will run commands as root by default. Since not specifying a username will cause {{c|su}} to ask for root privileges, the following command will run as root and halt the system:
{{Cmd|su -c 'shutdown -h now'}}

{{Note|It is best practice to encapsulate the commands following the <code>-c</code> option with either single or double quotes.}}

It is also possible to specify a user other than root to substitute commands. The following example will run the command {{c|echo}} as the user larry:
{{Cmd|su -c 'echo "Moo to the Gentoo Wiki reader out there!"' larry}}
