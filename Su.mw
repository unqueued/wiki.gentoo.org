'''su''' â€”  the '''s'''ubstitute '''u'''ser command. <tt>su</tt> can be used to impersonate other users on the system. It is included with the GNU's {{Package|sys-apps/coreutils}} package.

__TOC__

== Usage ==

The <tt>su</tt> command will run commands as root by default. Since not specifying a username will cause su to ask for root privileges, the following command will run as root and halt the system:
{{Cmd|su -c 'shutdown -h now'}}

{{Note|It is best practice to encapsulate the commands following the <code>-c</code> option with either single or double quotes.

It is also possible to specify a user other than root to substitute commands. The following example will run the command <tt>echo</tt> command from a user account called larry:
{{Cmd|su -c 'echo "Moo to the Gentoo wiki reader out there!"' larry}}
