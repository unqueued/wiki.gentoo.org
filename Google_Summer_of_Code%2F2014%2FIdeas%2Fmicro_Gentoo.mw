|micro Gentoo|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
One possible way of distributing software is to avoid the concept of binary packages and release full OS atomic updates remotely. One can create an extremely minimal system consisting of not much more than a kernel and would fetch needed files on-demand. It has great applications on the cloud for massive deployment of VM (CoreOS), easy maintenance netbook (ChromeOS), or science on the LHC (CernVM). One project could be to create automatically an extremely small Gentoo VM that would fetch needed files on boot, ala [http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/release_3.1.1 μ-CernVM], depending on the profile.
