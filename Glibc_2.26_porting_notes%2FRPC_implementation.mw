This page provides a guideline and example code snippets to port packages away from SunRPC - necessary for everything listed in tracker {{Bug|381391}}. The snippets are taken from the first package on the tracker that I encountered, net-analyzer/dsniff, from which I prepared [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/dev/dilfridge.git/tree/net-analyzer/dsniff?id=52ae73567656cf9cfa3a5572fc126f748f4a41a6 a reference implementation in my overlay].

== Strategies ==
Two strategies are possible: 
* either switch your package already now to hard-require libtirpc, 
* or make the RPC implementation controllable via a use-flag <code>libtirpc</code>, as discussed in detail below. 
'''For applications (leaf packages), a hard switch may make more sense.''' For libraries a controllable implementation is more useful (since things may explode when different object files linked into the same application use different implementations).

== Use flag(s) ==
If RPC support is optional, please use a use-flag <code>rpc</code> to enable / disable it entirely.

For switching between implementations, please use <code>libtirpc</code>: 
* if unset, use glibc's SunRPC, 
* if set, pull in net-lib/libtirpc.

 IUSE="+libtirpc"

It makes sense to default this flag to "on", for two reasons:
* libtirpc is the more modern and likely faster implementation
* libtirpc works independent of the installed glibc, while SunRPC will go away with glibc-2.26.

== Dependencies ==

 !libtirpc? ( elibc_glibc? ( sys-libs/glibc[rpc(-)] ) )
 libtirpc? ( net-libs/libtirpc )
 net-libs/rpcsvc-proto

(Depending on the package you may need net-libs/rpcsvc-proto or not. It provides the rpcgen binary and some header files. If you need those, you can safely depend on the package unconditionally.)

== Patching the build system ==
Here's an example <code>configure.ac</code> snippet for providing switchable RPC implementation:

 AC_ARG_WITH([libtirpc],
            AS_HELP_STRING([--with-libtirpc], [Use libtirpc as RPC implementation (instead of sunrpc)]),
            [], [ with_libtirpc=no ])
 
 AS_IF([test "x$with_libtirpc" != xno], 
       [PKG_CHECK_MODULES([TIRPC], 
                          [libtirpc], 
                          [RPC_CFLAGS=$TIRPC_CFLAGS; RPC_LIBS=$TIRPC_LIBS;],
                         [AC_MSG_ERROR([libtirpc requested, but library not found.])]
                        )], 
       [AC_CHECK_HEADER(rpc/rpc.h, 
                       [RPC_CFLAGS=""; RPC_LIBS="";],
                       [AC_MSG_ERROR([sunrpc requested, but headers are not present.])]
                      )]
 )
 
 AC_SUBST(RPC_CFLAGS)
 AC_SUBST(RPC_LIBS)

And here is a corresponding <code>Makefile.in</code> example snippet:

 INCS   = -I. @RPC_CFLAGS@
 LIBS   = @LIBS@ -L$(srcdir) @RPC_LIBS@

(When automake is used, you may want to patch <code>Makefile.am</code> instead.)

== src_configure ==

 econf $(use_with libtirpc)

Nuff said.
