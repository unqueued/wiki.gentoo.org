Although the N270 CPU was considered weak even at launch, its lack of speculative execution hardware makes it immune to [[Project:Security/Vulnerabilities/Meltdown_and_Spectre|Spectre and related security issues]]:

== Installation ==

As with most netbooks the Eee PC 1000H lacks an optical drive; an external one may be used, but a more common choice is [[LiveUSB/Guide|creating LiveUSB boot media]]. To boot from external media you have to press {{Key|Esc}} during the BIOS boot splash screen and select the right installation medium. After booting a live system follow the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml Gentoo Linux x86 Handbook].

{{note|The BIOS contains a “Boot Booster” feature, designed to speed up the boot process by caching some info on the hard disk. To ensure this works correctly, create one unused disk partition with MBR partition type {{c|EF}}, at least 32MB in size.}}

=== make.conf ===

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -march=bonnell -msahf -mmovbe -mfxsr"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
CPU_FLAGS_X86="mmx mmxext sse sse2 sse3 ssse3"
VIDEO_CARDS="intel i915"
INPUT_DEVICES="libinput"
}}

=== Compilation speed ===

To reduce compiling time and decrease the likelihood of builds failing due to low memory, consider using one or more of [[ccache]], [[distcc]], or [[zram]]. Upgrading the RAM to 2GB will help too, especially if building modern web browsers.

The required firmware files are available in {{package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} and {{package|net-wireless/wireless-regdb}}. PCIe hotplug is required for the {{Key|Fn+F2}} keyboard toggle to actually switch the card on and off.

If you have updated the BIOS to a recent version, it assumes you'll be running Windows 7 and by default presents a WMI interface instead of the native {{c|eeepc_laptop}} one. To fix this, append {{c|1=acpi_osi=Linux}} to the kernel command line. Although the kernel has an Eee PC WMI driver, it's intended for newer hardware and is severely crippled on this laptop.

Newer BIOS revisions have more {{key|Fn}} combinations (mostly on the unlabelled F-keys). Stable versions of the kernel have already received updates to recognise most of these, but {{key|Fn}}+{{key|space}} is still missing as of 4.19; [https://gitlab.com/flussence/kernel-patches a patch] fixes that.

=== USB ===
