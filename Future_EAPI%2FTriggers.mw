'''Triggers''' generally refer to various actions related to one package that are triggered by some event caused by another package. Examples of triggers in other distributions are [https://wiki.debian.org/DpkgTriggers DpkgTriggers] in Debian and [https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/alpm-hooks.5.html alpm-hooks] in Arch Linux. While those distributions support different kinds of triggers, the type most relevant to Gentoo are file triggers.

A '''file trigger''' gets activated when a package installs a file matching specific criteria. For example, if a package installs icons, a trigger can update the GTK+ icon cache.

==Current state in Gentoo==
A trigger-like functionality is currently provided by a few eclasses in Gentoo. There are two ways of implementing this. Either:
* the developer can explicitly call the relevant cache update functions in ``pkg_postinst`` and ``pkg_postrm`` when he knows that the package installs the specific files,
* the eclass can scan the installation image in ``pkg_preinst``, and afterwards call the cache update in ``pkg_postinst`` and ``pkg_postrm``.

The second method is similar to triggers, except they are manually implemented by eclass code.

==Current trigger candidates==
The following table lists candidates for explicit triggers. Whenever possible, please provide as much detail as possible as to the conditions triggering them.
