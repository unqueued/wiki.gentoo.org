GNU Screen is a program that enables the user to create sessions and have several virtual consoles.

== Installation ==
Full-screen window manager that multiplexes physical terminals between several processes.<br>
{{Package|app-misc/screen}} is available on Gentoo Linux and supports the following useflags

* ''debug'' = Enable extra debug codepaths, like asserts and extra output. If you want to get meaningful backtraces see http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/backtraces.xml
* ''multiuser'' = Enable multiuser support (by setting correct permissions)
* ''nethack'' = Express error messages in nethack style
* ''pam'' = Adds support for PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) - DANGEROUS to arbitrarily flip

You can install Screen using the following command:
{{RootCmd|emerge -av app-misc/screen}}

The configuration files are located in

{{Code|Screen Configuration Files|<pre>
/etc/screenrc
~/.screenrc</pre>}}

== Usage ==
General usage of Screen
=== Start Session ===
Screen can be started with the following command:
{{Cmd|screen}}
Once started is will create a socket for the session in /var/run/screen/S-<username>
You can use any key combination within the session except of Ctrl+A which initiates the ''Command-Mode''.<br>
Give the session a reasonable name on startup:
{{Cmd|screen -t portage}}
Start a command in a screen session without attaching to it (like a daemon):
{{Cmd|screen -t portage -d -m emerge -DuN world}}
=== Commands ===
In ''Command Mode'' (Ctrl + A) the following key combinations can be used:
* C = create another terminal
* N = switch to the next terminal
* D = detach from the current session

=== Resume Session ===
After the session is detached, all the active terminals remain active and so do commands that didn't finish yet. To list existing sessions:
{{Cmd|screen -ls
|output=<pre>There is a screen on:
        30014.pts-1.disi-bigtop (Detached)
1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-disi.
</pre>}}
To resume this session:
{{Cmd|screen -r 30014.pts-1.disi-bigtop}}
