{{Lowercase title}}
This article describes the setup of ''i8k'', a driver to monitor cpu temperature and fan speed of some Dell Inspiron and Latitude laptops.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    <M> Dell laptop support
</pre>}}

When you load the module, there is a check, if your laptop is supported. If not, the module will not load. If you want to load the module anyway, you have to build the driver as module. Then you can set an option to force the load of the module:
{{RootCmd|modprobe i8k force{{=}}1}}

{{Warning|Loading the driver on an untested laptop can crash the system.}}

=== Software ===
See the [[lm_sensors]] article.

=== Addon software ===
* {{Package|app-laptop/i8kutils}} - Dell Inspiron and Latitude utilities
* {{Package|x11-plugins/i8krellm}} - [[GKrellM]]2 plugin
