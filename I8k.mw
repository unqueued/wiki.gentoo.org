{{Lowercase title}}
This article describes the setup of ''i8k'', a kernel module to monitor cpu temperature and control fan speed on Dell laptops.

== Installation ==
There is no need to install i8k kernel module as i8k kernel module comes ready in most recent (2014) kernels.

=== Kernel ===
If compiling a customized kernel, you need to activate the following options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    <M> Dell laptop support
</pre>}}

When the module is loaded, there is a check. If your laptop is supported, ok. If not, the module will fail to load.

If you want to load the module anyway, put the option 'force=1' right after the command as shown below:
{{RootCmd|modprobe i8k force{{=}}1}}

{{Warning|Loading the driver on an untested laptop can crash the system.}}

=== Software ===
* {{Package|app-laptop/i8kutils}} - Fan control for Dell laptops
i8kutils contains the user-space programs needed to handle the data provided by the i8k kernel module.

=== Addon software ===
* {{Package|x11-plugins/i8krellm}} - [[GKrellM]]2 plugin

== External resources ==
