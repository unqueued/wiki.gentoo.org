OpenVPN (Open Virtual Private Network) is software that enables the creation of secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

{{KernelBox|title=Enable <var>CONFIG_TUN</var> in the kernel|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Network device support  --->
        [*] Network core driver support
        <*>   Universal TUN/TAP device driver support
}}

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=net-vpn/openvpn}}

=== Emerge ===

Install the OpenVPN package:

{{RootCmd|emerge -v net-vpn/openvpn}}

Also consider installing {{Package|net-dns/openresolv}}.

== Configuration ==

=== Server side ===

If this is the first time setting up an openvpn server, we will need to [[Create a Public Key Infrastructure Using the easy-rsa Scripts|create a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) from scratch]].

{{Note|In this example place all generated keys into {{Path|/etc/openvpn/example/}} }}

{{Note|The example will just setup a single server. For multiple OpenVPN instances see the '[[#Gentoo specifics|Gentoo specifics]]' section.}}

Write a server-side openvpn configuration.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf|title=Setup a example UDP OpenVPN server|1=
# server binding port
port 12112

# openvpn protocol, could be tcp / udp / tcp6 / udp6
proto udp

# tun/tap device

# keys configuration, use generated keys

cert example/example.crt
key example/example.key
dh example/dh2048.pem

# optional tls-auth key to secure identifying
# tls-auth example/ta.key 0

}}

Start openvpn server, run

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/openvpn start}}

=== Client side ===

Copy the necessary key files to client, via a '''secure''' way (such as SSH), including

* ca.crt
* client1.csr (in this example)
* client1.crt (in this example)
* client1.key (in this example)
* ta.key (if using tls-auth)

Write a client-side openvpn configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf|title=client-side udp openvpn configuration|1=
# specify client-side
client

# tun/tap device
dev tun0

# protocol, according to server
proto udp

# server address
remote address.to.server 12112

# connection
comp-lzo
resolv-retry 30
nobind

# persistent device and keys
persist-key
persist-tun

# keys settings
ca example/ca.crt
cert example/client1.crt
key example/client1.key

# optional tls-auth
# tls-auth exmaple/ta.key 1

# pull dns settings from the server
script-security 2

# These scripts are defaults within the service script. To specify custom scripts,
# use /etc/openvpn/${SVCNAME}- {up,down}.sh as suggested by the service script.
# If you use systemd, SVCNAME will not get set automatically.
# Add `setenv SVCNAME my_svc_name` to set it, where my_svc_name is determined by
# /etc/openvpn/client/my_svc_name.conf
up /etc/openvpn/up.sh
down /etc/openvpn/down.sh

# logging
log /etc/openvpn/openvpn.log
verb 4

}}

To automatically provide username and password, or just username with the password still prompted, add the following option, where auth is the file name containing 1 line with a username, or 2 lines with a username and password.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf|title=client-side openvpn configuration for automating username/password|1=
auth-user-pass /etc/openvpn/auth
}}

To start client, run

=== OpenRC ===

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/openvpn start}}

=== systemd ===

{{RootCmd|systemctl start openvpn}}

If all goes well, this would give you a working OpenVPN server and client connection.

== Monitoring ==

While the service is running, there are ways to monitor it.

=== Syslog ===

Assuming that syslog is enabled, OpenVPN's output is available, along with other services, on syslog.

Additionally, you can send signal to have it displaying status.

{{RootCmd|killall -USR2 openvpn ; tail -f /var/log/syslog}}

{{Note|This command does nothing but requesting statistic info. Nevertheless, be careful when using {{c|killall}} command!}}

== Gentoo specifics ==

The init script allows multiple tunnels. Decide on a name for the tunnel - eg EXAMPLE

=== Using OpenRC ===

{{RootCmd|ln -s /etc/init.d/openvpn /etc/init.d/openvpn.EXAMPLE}}

Now create your config as /etc/openvpn/EXAMPLE.conf 

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/openvpn.EXAMPLE start}}

=== Using systemd ===
Due to dependencies server and client operations are separated into two units.

Create your server config as /etc/openvpn/server/EXAMPLE.conf
{{RootCmd|systemctl start openvpn-server@EXAMPLE}}

Create your client config as /etc/openvpn/client/EXAMPLE.conf
{{RootCmd|systemctl start openvpn-client@EXAMPLE}}

You can then create more tunnels by replacing EXAMPLE with more names.  Each one has its own configuration and can be stopped and started individually.  The default is simply to use openvpn.conf and not symlink the service.  You can of course use both methods.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== /etc/resolv.conf doesn't get updated ===

Ensure that the option <var>up</var> and <var>down</var> on the configuration file points to the right path for the script.

Also, [[dhcpcd]] is known to overwrite pre-existing file when service is ran (e.g. either automatically called by other script, or manually called thru {{Package|net-misc/netifrc}}). 

In most cases, the conflict between different network programs can be resolved by installing {{Package|net-dns/openresolv}}. The configuration would work out-of-box. Most networking scripts (including Gentoo's OpenVPN up & down script; along with dhcpcd) would regard its presence.

If disabling dhcpcd's resolv.conf update is necessary ('''most likely not'''), add the line below to {{Path|/etc/dhcpcd.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/dhcpcd.conf|1=nohook resolv.conf}}
