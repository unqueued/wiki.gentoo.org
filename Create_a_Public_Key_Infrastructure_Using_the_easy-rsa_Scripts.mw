[[OpenVPN|<< back to OpenVPN]]

The first step to setup a OpenVPN server is to create a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)] from scratch. It consists of 

*A public master Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and a private key
*A separate public certificate and private key pair (hereafter referred to as a certificate) for each server and each client.

We could use easy-rsa scripts to do this. Install it by running

{{emerge|app-crypt/easy-rsa}}


== Creating certificates ==

To keep creating process separated, we could copy scripts to different place every time to do the job.

{{RootCmd|cp -a /usr/share/easy-rsa /root/easy-rsa-example}}

change directory

{{RootCmd|cd /root/easy-rsa-example}}
{{RootCmd|mv vars.example vars}}

To ensure the consistent use of values when generating the PKI, set default values to be used by the PKI generating scripts. Edit /root/easy-rsa-example/vars and at a minimum set the 
* EASYRSA_DN "org"
* EASYRSA_REQ_COUNTRY
* EASYRSA_REQ_PROVINCE
* EASYRSA_REQ_CITY
* EASYRSA_REQ_ORG
* EASYRSA_REQ_EMAIL
parameters (do not leave any of these parameters blank). Change the KEY_SIZE parameter to 2048 for the SSL/TLS to use 2048bit RSA keys for authentication.

{{FileBox|filename=/root/easy-rsa-example/vars|1=
# Choices are:
#   cn_only  - use just a CN value
#   org      - use the "traditional" Country/Province/City/Org/OU/email/CN format

set_var EASYRSA_DN      "org"

# Organizational fields (used with 'org' mode and ignored in 'cn_only' mode.)
# These are the default values for fields which will be placed in the
# certificate.  Don't leave any of these fields blank, although interactively
# you may omit any specific field by typing the "." symbol (not valid for
# email.)

set_var EASYRSA_REQ_COUNTRY     "US"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_PROVINCE    "CA"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_CITY        "SanFrancisco"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_ORG         "Fort-Funston"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_EMAIL       "mail@host.domain"
}}

Delete any previously created certificates.

{{Warning|This will delete any previously generated certificates stored in /root/easy-rsa-example/pki, including the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.}}

{{RootCmd| ./easyrsa init-pki}}

The option build-ca generates the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate.

There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Name [changeme]:
Email Address [mail@host.domain]:</pre>}}

The option gen-req <code>#  ./easyrsa gen-req <server name> nopass </code> generates a server certificate request and key. Make sure that the server name (Common Name when running the script) is unique.
Option nopass means no need to import password.

The option sign-req <code>#  ./easyrsa sign-req server <server name> </code> sign the certificate .crt file needed by the server.
{{RootCmd| ./easyrsa sign-req server example|output=<pre>

source or that you have verified the request checksum with the sender.

Request subject, to be signed as a server certificate for 3650 days:

The option gen-dh generates the Diffie-Hellman parameters .pem file needed by the server.

The option build-client-full <code>#  ./easyrsa build-client-full <client name> nopass </code> generates a client certificate and key. Make sure that the client name (Common Name when running the script) is unique. Option nopass means no need to input password.

{{Note|Do not enter a challenge password or company name when the script prompts you for one.}}

{{Important|Every time to create a new client's key, you would just to do this step.}}

{{RootCmd|openvpn --genkey --secret /root/easy-rsa-example/pki/ta.key}}

{{Important|You would like to keep the <code>/root/easy-rsa-example</code> folder for further usage.}}

And now, you can go on to setup the server configuration.

{{Note|The option build-server-full <code>#  ./easyrsa build-server-full <server name> nopass </code> generates a server certificate and key(do the same thing as genreq and sign-req).
