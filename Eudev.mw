eudev is a fork of systemd's [[udev]] with the goal of obtaining better compatibility with existing software such as OpenRC, Upstart, older kernels, various toolchains, and anything else required by (but not well supported by) udev. For configurations not utilizing [[systemd]], eudev is Gentoo's default [[device file]] manager.<ref>{{Bug|575718|text=Bug 575718 - Request for council decision RE virtual/udev default provider}}, [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ Gentoo's Bugzilla Main Page], (Last modified) February 27th, 2016.

=== Migrating from udev to eudev ===

Migrating from udev 216 to eudev 1.10-r2 (March 2015) is straight forward:<ref>http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7712064.html#7712064</ref>
{{RootCmd
|emerge --ask sys-fs/eudev
}}

In case you have multilib and, for example, you have the following string:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|lang=bash|1=
sys-fs/udev abi_x86_32
}}
Then don't forget to change it too:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|lang=bash|1=
sys-fs/eudev abi_x86_32
}}

==== Keep classic 'eth0' naming ====
There are multiple options to keep the classic <code>eth0</code>, <code>eth1</code>, etc. naming. The simplest ones are:
{{RootCmd
|touch /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-name-slot.rules
}}
Alternatively add <code>net.ifnames=0</code> to the kernel command line, change the default policy or create your own.<ref>https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/#idontlikethishowdoidisablethis</ref>

==== Use new 'predictable' naming ====
The network interface naming convention is not the same so interfaces will need to be re-linked. Use {{Path|/etc/init.d/net.lo}} as a link target for whatever interface names need to be added. Be sure to replace <code><interface_name></code> in the commands below with the Ethernet interface names that are present on the system. It is possible to discover which interfaces exist by running the {{c|ifconfig}} command:

{{Cmd|ifconfig}}

Create symbolic links for the existing interfaces in the {{Path|/etc/init.d/}} and {{Path|/etc/conf.d/}} directories:

{{RootCmd
|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.lo /etc/init.d/net.<interface_name>
|ln -s /etc/conf.d/net.lo /etc/conf.d/net.<interface_name>
}}

Add the script(s) to the default runlevel to have the interface(s) start automatically:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add net.<interface_name> default}}

=== Migrating older releases ===

==== udev 171-r10 to eudev 1.2-r1 ====
