eudev is a fork of systemd-udev with the goal of obtaining better compatibility with existing software such as OpenRC, Upstart, older kernels, various toolchains, and anything else required by, but not well supported by, udev.

=== Migrating from udev to eudev ===

Migrating from udev 216 to eudev 1.10-r2 (March 2015) is straight forward:<ref>http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7712064.html#7712064</ref>

The network interface naming convention is not the same so interfaces will need to be re-linked. Use {{Path|/etc/init.d/net.lo}} as a link target for whatever interface names need to be added. Be sure to replace <code><interface_name></code> in the commands below with the Ethernet interface names that are present on the system. It is possible to discover which interfaces exist by running the <tt>ifconfig</tt> command:

{{Cmd|ifconfig}}

Create symbolic links for the existing interfaces in the {{Path|/etc/init.d/}} and {{Path|/etc/conf.d/}} directories:

{{RootCmd
|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.lo /etc/init.d/net.<interface_name>
|ln -s /etc/conf.d/net.lo /etc/conf.d/net.<interface_name>}}

Add the script(s) to the default runlevel to have the interface(s) start automatically:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add net.<interface_name> default}}
