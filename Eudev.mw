eudev is a fork of systemd-udev with the goal of obtaining better compatibility with existing software such as OpenRC and Upstart, older kernels, various toolchains and anything else required by users and various distributions.


== Migrate from udev to eudev ==

Migrating from udev 216 to eudev 1.10-r2 (March 2015) is straigthforward : [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7712064.html#7712064 forum thread]

    emerge --ask eudev

The network interface naming convention is not the same so you'll need to re-link /etc/init.d from net.lo to net.eth0 or net.whatever networking interface you're using.

    ln -s /etc/init.d/net.lo /etc/init.d/net.eth0

then re-link your conf.d :

    ln -s /etc/conf.d/net.lo /etc/conf.d/net.eth0

And add to the default runlevel :

    rc-update add net.eth0 default
