For configurations not using systemd, '''eudev''' is Gentoo's [[device file]] manager for the Linux kernel.<ref>{{Bug|575718|text=Bug 575718 - Request for council decision RE virtual/udev default provider}}, [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ Gentoo's Bugzilla Main Page], (Last modified) February 27th, 2016. Retrieved on March 1st, 2016.</ref> It manages device nodes in {{Path|[[#The_.2Fdev_directory|/dev]]}} and handles all user space actions when adding or removing devices.  It is a fork of systemd's [[udev]] with the goal of obtaining better compatibility with existing software such as OpenRC, Upstart, older kernels, various toolchains, and anything else required<ref>[[Project:Eudev]], [[Main_Page|Gentoo Wiki]], (Last modified) November 12th, 2015. Retrieved on March 11th, 2016.</ref> by (but not well supported by) udev. Configurations utilizing [[systemd]], don't use it.

== The /dev directory ==

{{:/dev/en}}

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

Some packages know the <code>[https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/udev udev]</code> [[USE flag]] for enabling {{Package|virtual/udev}} integration.

{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/eudev}}

=== Emerge ===

In order to avoid registration in the [[World_set_(Portage)|world set]], the oneshot option should be used.

{{Emerge|sys-fs/eudev|params=--ask --oneshot}}

== Configuration ==

=== RC service ===

The RC name is udev, not eudev.  It needs to be registered in the sysinit runlevel.

{{RootCmd|rc-update add udev sysinit|output= * rc-update: udev already installed in runlevel `sysinit'; skipping}}

Depending on the version number of {{package|sys-fs/udev-init-scripts}}, also <code>udev-trigger</code> should be [https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2015-06-08-udev-init-scripts-changes.html added to the sysinit runlevel].

=== Migrating from udev to eudev ===

Migrating from udev 216 to eudev 1.10-r2 (March 2015) is straight forward:<ref>http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7712064.html#7712064</ref>
{{RootCmd
|emerge --ask sys-fs/eudev
}}

In case you have multilib and, for example, you have the following string:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|lang=bash|1=
sys-fs/udev abi_x86_32
}}
Then don't forget to change it too:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|lang=bash|1=
sys-fs/eudev abi_x86_32
}}

==== Keep classic 'eth0' naming ====

{{:Eudev/Network_device_names/en}}

Alternatively add <code>net.ifnames=0</code> to the kernel command line, change the default policy or create your own.<ref>https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/#idontlikethishowdoidisablethis</ref><ref>https://github.com/gentoo/eudev/issues/117</ref>

==== Use new 'predictable' naming ====
The network interface naming convention is not the same so interfaces will need to be re-linked. Use {{Path|/etc/init.d/net.lo}} as a link target for whatever interface names need to be added. Be sure to replace <code><interface_name></code> in the commands below with the Ethernet interface names that are present on the system. It is possible to discover which interfaces exist by running the {{c|ifconfig}} command:

{{Cmd|ifconfig}}

Create symbolic links for the existing interfaces in the {{Path|/etc/init.d/}} and {{Path|/etc/conf.d/}} directories:

{{RootCmd
|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.lo /etc/init.d/net.<interface_name>
|ln -s /etc/conf.d/net.lo /etc/conf.d/net.<interface_name>
}}

Add the script(s) to the default runlevel to have the interface(s) start automatically:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add net.<interface_name> default}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Using udevadm ===

Start {{c|udevadm monitor}} and see what happens:

{{Cmd|udevadm monitor}}

Get device info using {{c|udevadm info }} followed by the device path

{{Cmd|udevadm info -p /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7}}

Get the device path using its name

{{Cmd|udevadm info -q path -n input/mouse1|output=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-3/1-3.4/1-3.4:1.0/0003:046D:C404.0006/input/input24/mouse1}}

Test an event run using {{c|udevadm test }}

{{Cmd|udevadm test /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7}}

Get a list of all {{c|udevadm}} commands

{{Cmd|udevadm -h}}

=== Migrating older releases ===

==== udev 171-r10 to eudev 1.2-r1 ====

=== Broken system switching from udev to eudev ===
