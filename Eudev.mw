eudev is a fork of systemd's [[udev]] with the goal of obtaining better compatibility with existing software such as OpenRC, Upstart, older kernels, various toolchains, and anything else required by (but not well supported by) udev.

=== Migrating from udev to eudev ===

Migrating from udev 216 to eudev 1.10-r2 (March 2015) is straight forward:<ref>http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7712064.html#7712064</ref>
{{RootCmd
|emerge --ask sys-fs/eudev
}}

In case you have multilib and, for example, you have the following string:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|lang=bash||1=
sys-fs/udev abi_x86_32
}}
Then don't forget to change it too:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|lang=bash||1=
sys-fs/eudev abi_x86_32
}}

==== Keep classic 'eth0' naming ====
There are multiple options to keep the classic <code>eth0</code>, <code>eth1</code>, etc. naming. The simplest ones are:
{{RootCmd
|touch /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-name-slot.rules
}}
Alternatively add <code>net.ifnames=0</code> to the kernel command line, change the default policy or create your own.<ref>https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/#idontlikethishowdoidisablethis</ref>

==== Use new 'predictable' naming ====
The network interface naming convention is not the same so interfaces will need to be re-linked. Use {{Path|/etc/init.d/net.lo}} as a link target for whatever interface names need to be added. Be sure to replace <code><interface_name></code> in the commands below with the Ethernet interface names that are present on the system. It is possible to discover which interfaces exist by running the {{c|ifconfig}} command:

{{Cmd|ifconfig}}

Create symbolic links for the existing interfaces in the {{Path|/etc/init.d/}} and {{Path|/etc/conf.d/}} directories:

{{RootCmd
|ln -s /etc/init.d/net.lo /etc/init.d/net.<interface_name>
|ln -s /etc/conf.d/net.lo /etc/conf.d/net.<interface_name>
}}

Add the script(s) to the default runlevel to have the interface(s) start automatically:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add net.<interface_name> default}}

=== Migrating older releases ===

==== udev 171-r10 to eudev 1.2-r1 ====
