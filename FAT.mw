The File Allocation Table (FAT) [[filesystem]] was originally created for use with MS-DOS (and later pre-NT Microsoft Windows); currently a late version of FAT (FAT32) is used for USB flash disks.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table</ref> It has made its way over to Linux systems and has official support in the Linux kernel.
