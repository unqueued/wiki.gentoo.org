The File Allocation Table (FAT) [[filesystem]] was originally created for use with MS-DOS (and later pre-NT Microsoft Windows); currently a late version of FAT (FAT32) is used for USB flash disks.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table</ref> It has made its way over to Linux systems and has official support in the Linux kernel.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

{{KernelBox|title=Enable FAT support (<var>CONFIG_VFAT_FS</var>)|1=
File systems  --->
   DOS/FAT/NT Filesystems  --->
      <*> VFAT (Windows-95) fs support
      (437) Default codepage for FAT 
      (iso8859-1) Default iocharset for FAT
}}

=== Emerge ===

The {{Package|sys-fs/dosfstools}} package is needed for FAT userspace utilities:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/dosfstools}}

== Usage ==

It should be possible to mount FAT filesystems with the {{c|[[mount]]}} command.

== Removal ==

=== Unmerge ===

{{Emerge|params+=--unmerge|sys-fs/dosfstools}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Slow file transfer speeds ===

If file transfer speeds are slow, try remounting the filesystem with the <code>flush</code> mount option. <code>flush</code> can be a stark contrast to the <code>sync</code> mount option:

{{RootCmd|mount -o remount,flush /path/to/mountpoint}}
