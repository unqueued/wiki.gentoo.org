The File Allocation Tale (FAT) filesystem was originally created for Microsoft Windows. It has made its way over to Linux systems and has official support in the Linux kernel.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

{{KernelBox|title=Enable FAT support (<var>CONFIG_VFAT_FS</var>)|1=
File systems  --->
   DOS/FAT/NT Filesystems  --->
      <*> VFAT (Windows-95) fs support
      (437) Default codepage for FAT 
      (iso8859-1) Default iocharset for FAT
}}

=== Emerge ===

The {{Package|sys-fs/dosfstools}} package is needed for FAT userspace utilities:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/dosfstools}}

== Usage ==

It should be possible to mount FAT filesystems with the {{c|mount}} command.

{{Emerge|params+=--unmerge|sys-fs/dosfstools}}
