== Gentoo Hardened and SELinux Tutorials ==

[[SELinux]] is sometimes seen as a daunting additional security measure on a Linux system. And it probably is, since it requires the users to have some non-basic knowledge of Linux and what SELinux is. In this series of tutorials, we will try to teach you what SELinux is, how you can work with it, how to configure it to your needs, etc.

Throughout the tutorials, we will assume you have access to a SELinux enabled system. This can be a RedHat Enterprise Linux (6 or higher) system, a Fedora system, CentOS, Gentoo Hardened and more. If you can get it to boot, you can even use the selinuxnode (experimental) SELinux-enabled live environment (KVM/Qemu guest) offered through Gentoo's mirrors (in the {{Path|experimental/amd64/qemu-selinux}} location).

Within each tutorial, we will try to guide you through new vocabulary used by SELinux, changes compared to a regular Linux system, and more. At the end of each tutorial, you will find a '''What you need to remember''' part. This is a quick reference of what the tutorial is about, and might help you in the future to remember some stuff without having to read the entire tutorial again.

So, let's get started.

=== Introduction to SELinux ===

This first set of tutorials are an introduction to SELinux. They cover basic SELinux stuff and do not focus on Gentoo specifics (or at least not too much), so they are reusable for other SELinux-enabled distributions as well.
