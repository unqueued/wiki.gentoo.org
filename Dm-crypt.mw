dm-crypt is a disk encryption system using the kernels crypto API framework and device mapper. dm-crypt is cappable of encrypting whole disks, logical volumes, single files and RAID volumes.

== Kernel Configuration ==
To use dm-crypt the certain kernel modules must be built such as any hashing functions or stream ciphers that are to be used to encrypt the volume, a file system that is to be applied to the encrypted volume such as ext3, loopback device support and initrd support. For a basic configuration SHA256 and MD5 hashes are generally built into the kernel by default along with the AES cipher, if different alogrithms are required these can be found under the Cryptographic API section. This is an example of a basic kernel configuration.

{{Kernel|Configuring the kernel|<pre>
    General setup  --->
      [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
[*] Enable loadable module support
    Device Drivers --->
      [*] Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) --->
        <*> Device mapper support
        <*> Crypt target support
      [*] Block Devices --->
        <*>  Loopback device support
[*] Cryptographic API --->
    <*> SHA224 and SHA256 digest algorithm

</pre>}}

Most of the gentoo install media will have the basic modules built in by default, however more custom modules such as Whirlpool hashes are not included, but can easily be built then loaded.

== Configuring Encrypted Volume ==
For this example the volume will be  a plain partition (/dev/sda1)

* Load kernel modules appropriate to your setup
{{RootCmd|modprobe {dm-mod,dm-crypt,aes,sha256,cbc} }}
* Generate key
{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/dev/urandom of{{=}}keyFile bs{{=}}1024 count{{=}}4}}
* Fill volume with random bits/shred (optional)
{{RootCmd|shred -v -n 2 /dev/sda1}}
or
{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/dev/urandom of{{=}}/dev/sda1 bs{{=}}1M}}
* cryptsetup luksFormat
For keyFile based auth
{{RootCmd|cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1 keyFile}}
For password based auth
{{RootCmd|cryptsetup -y luksFormat /dev/sda1}}
* cryptsetup open
For keyFile based auth
{{RootCmd|cryptsetup -d keyFile luksOpen /dev/sda1 encVol}}
For password based auth
{{RootCmd|cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 encVol}}
* mkfs, using ext4 in this case
{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/encVol}}
* mount
{{RootCmd|mount /dev/mapper/encVol MOUNTPOINT}}

== Initrd Config For Wholedisk Encryption ==

The easiest option for booting an encrypted root partition is to use [[dracut]], dracut is a flexible modular initramfs infrastructure and aims to have as little as possible hard-coded into the initramfs. To configure dracut for dm-crypt make sure to include the dracut crypt module. Follow the installation guide here making sure to include the crypt module along with any others required

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
DRACUT_MODULES="crypt ..."
</pre>}}
