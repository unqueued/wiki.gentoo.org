In this guide provides instructions on setting up a basic virtual server using the OpenVZ Technology.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

Install the {{Package|sys-kernel/openvz-sources}} package:

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/openvz-sources}}

=== Kernel ===

{{KernelBox|title=Configure openvz-sources|1=
Processor type and features  --->
  [*] Fair CPU scheduler
  [*]   VCPU scheduler support
File Systems  --->
  [*] Quota support
  <M> VPS filesystem
  <M> Virtuozzo Disk Quota support
  [ ]   Unloadable Virtuozzo Disk Quota module
  [*]   Per-user and per-group quota in Virtuozzo quota partitions
OpenVZ  --->
  [*] Virtual Environment support
  <M>   VE calls interface
  [ ]   Enable sysfs support in Virtual Environments
  <M>   VE networking
  [*]     VE netfiltering
  <M>   VE watchdog module
}}

After you've built and installed the kernel (steps not covered in this article), update the boot loader and reboot to see if the kernel boots correctly.

=== Host environment ===

To maintain your virtual servers you need the {{Package|sys-cluster/vzctl}} package which contains all necessary programs and many useful features:

{{Emerge|sys-cluster/vzctl}}

== Configuration ==

The vzctl packages has installed an init script called {{Path|vz}}. It will help you to start/stop virtual servers on boot/shutdown:

{{RootCmd
|rc-update add vz default
|/etc/init.d/vz start
}}

=== Creating a guest template ===

==== Template tarball ====

Since many hardware related commands are not available inside a virtual server, there has been a patched version of baselayout known as baselayout-vserver. However all required changes have been integrated into normal baselayout-2, eliminating the need for seperate vserver stages, profiles and baselayout. The only (temporary) drawback is that baselayout-2 is still considered to be in alpha stage and there are no stages with baselayout-2 available on the mirrors yet.

As soon as baselayout-2 is stable you can use a precompiled stage3/4 from one of our mirrors. In the meantime please download a stage3/4 from here.

{{Note|Unfortunately <tt>vzctl</tt> does not understand bzip2 (yet?) and needs a different filename to recognize Gentoo as the distribution, so you have to convert the stage tarball.}}

Convert the stage tarball:

{{RootCmd
|cd /vz/template/cache
|bunzip2 stage4-<arch>-<version>.tar.bz2
|mv stage4-tarball.tar gentoo-<arch>-<version>.tar
|gzip gentoo-<arch>-<version>.tar
|cd -
}}

Create VPS

{{RootCmd|vzctl create <vpsid> --ostemplate gentoo-<arch>-<version>}}

{{Note|Do not use vpsids <{{=}}100, they are reserved.}}

== Usage ==

=== Test the virtual server ===

You should be able to start and enter the vserver by using the commands below:

{{RootCmd
|vzctl start <vpsid>
|vzctl enter <vpsid>
}}

{{RootCmd|ps ax|output=<pre>
PID   TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 ?        S      0:00 init [3]
20496 pts/0    S      0:00 /bin/bash -i
20508 pts/0    R+     0:00 ps ax
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|logout}}
