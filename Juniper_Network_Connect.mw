There are various site that discuss getting Juniper's "Network Connect" to work, particularly under a 64-bit system.

and 
http://makefile.com/.plan/2009/10/juniper-vpn-64-bit-linux-an-unsolved-mystery/ helped the most.

However none worked for me.

====
Here is what worked for me as of Oct 2013:

My target requires login via a web page, and they have multiple pages on the portal for different groups. The vpn client would not start automatically, or complete when mannually invoked using ncsvc.

Possible requirements: SUN Java JRE (both 64 and 32 bit versions) with nsplugin , eg 

-app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java and 

-dev-java/sun-jre-bin

Probably also openssl and others. I already had everything installed except the 32 bit java with nsplugin.

====
# Go to the network portal web page, and examine page source for REALM

# Login through web portal, attmpt to intiate network connect.
Software downloads and installs into ~/.juniper_network/network_connect/
examine the cookies for the site and find DSID. This will have to be refreshed each time.

# cd into this directory.

# get the certificate, eg
<pre>openssl s_client -connect portal.example.net:443 -showcerts < /dev/null 2> /dev/null {{!}}  openssl x509 -outform der > cert.der
</pre>
# compile the lbncui.so into an executable file 
<pre>gcc -m32 -Wl,-rpath,`pwd` -o ncui libncui.so</pre>

# then execute:
<pre>./ncui -h portal.example.net -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -r REALM -f cert.der -l 5 -L 5 -U https://portal.example.net/dana-na/auth/url_0/welcome.cgi -c DSID=COOKIE-VALUE-FOR-DSID</pre>

where https://portal.example.net/dana-na/auth/url_0/welcome.cgi is the full path to the login page on the portal.

with any luck you'll be connected. there should be a TUN device listed with ifconfig.

Happy computing!
