The <var>FEATURES</var> variable contains a list of Portage features that the user wants enabled on the system, effectively influencing Portage's behavior. It is set by default via the Gentoo [[profile]], but can be easily updated through {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/make.conf]]}}. Since this is an incremental variable, <var>FEATURES</var> values can be added without directly overriding the ones implemented through the Gentoo profile.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Adding keepwork to FEATURES in Portage|lang=bash|1=
FEATURES="keepwork"
}}</onlyinclude>

{{c|[[portageq]]}} can be used to show the active features:

{{Cmd|portageq envvar FEATURES}}

For more information, please see [[Handbook:AMD64/Working/Features|Portage features]] in the Gentoo Handbook and the [[FEATURES]] article. For a complete list of available features, see {{c|man 5 make.conf}}.</includeonly></onlyinclude>
