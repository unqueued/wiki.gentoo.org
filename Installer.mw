installer is designed to aid users during the installation process of Gentoo Linux. It is capable of walking a beginner user through the regular installation process following key topics from the Gentoo Handbook. It is ChrisADR's personal project, the official installer project is in charge of designing the official Gentoo installer.

== Installation ==

installer is designed to be part of the Gentoo Live CD image, but it can also be installed via Portage.

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|app-admin/installer}}

== Usage ==

Once inside the live environment, it is ready to begin an installation process from scratch via:

installer can also be used by root to generate stageX tarball, which contains some configuration files that may help as backup configuration or in further installations.

== Removal ==

Since installer will be only available by default in the live CD image, the only reason to unmerge installer is if you already installed it with Portage.

=== Unmerge ===

{{Emerge|app-admin/installer|params+=--depclean}}
