'''QEMU''' ('''Q'''uick '''EMU'''lator) is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.  Often it is used in conjunction with acceleration in the form of a Type-I hypervisor such as '''KVM''' ('''K'''ernel-based '''V'''irtual '''M'''achine) or Xen.  If no accelerator is used, Qemu will run entirely in user-space using its built in binary translator TCG (Tiny Code Generator).  Using Qemu without an accelerator is relatively inefficient and slow.

{{Note|This article typically uses KVM as the accelerator of choice due to its GPL licensing and availability.  Without KVM nearly all commands described here will still work (unless KVM specific)}}


== Installation ==

=== BIOS ===
In order to utilize KVM your processor must support either Vt-x or AMD-V which are Intel and AMD's respective technology for permitting multiple operating systems to concurrently execute operations on their processors.   

To check if your hardware supports virtualization:
{{Cmd|egrep --color -E "vmx{{!}}svm" /proc/cpuinfo}}  

For a period manufacturers were shipping with virtualization turned off by default in the system [[BIOS]]. Note that changing this feature in the BIOS may actually require you to fully remove power from your system to take effect.

If KVM is installed there should be a device at {{Path|/dev/kvm}}.

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{KernelBox|1=
[*] Virtualization  --->
    <*>   Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) support

    If you have an Intel processor:
    <*>     KVM for Intel processors support

    If you have an AMD processor:
    <*>     KVM for AMD processors support

    Needed for "vhost-net" USE flag (recommend):
    <*>   Host kernel accelerator for virtio net
}}

{{KernelBox|title=Optional advanced networking support|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Network device support  --->
    [*]   Network core driver support
    <*>     Universal TUN/TAP device driver support

Needed for 802.1d Ethernet Bridging:
[*] Networking support  --->
        Networking options  --->
            <*> 802.1d Ethernet Bridging
}}

{{KernelBox|title=''python'' USE flag: Linux file capabilities support|1=
Kernel hacking  --->
        Compile-time checks and compiler options  --->
            [*] Debug Filesystem
}}

{{KernelBox|title=''filecaps'' USE flag: kvm_stat support|1=
File systems  --->

    If you use the ext4 filesystem:
    <*> The Extended 4 (ext4) filesystem
    [*]   Ext4 Security Labels
}}

=== Software ===
Install {{Package|app-emulation/qemu}}:

=== Frontends ===
To make life easier, there are multiple user-friendly front-ends to QEMU:
* {{Package|app-emulation/aqemu}}
* {{Package|app-emulation/libvirt}}
* {{Package|app-emulation/virt-manager}}

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
In order to run a KVM accelerated virtual machine without logging into root, you must add your self to the ''kvm'' linux group.
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a YOUR_USER_NAME kvm}}

== Usage ==
* See [[QEMU/Options|QEMU options]] page for common options
* [[QEMU/Linux guest|Setup a Linux guest]]
* [[QEMU/Windows guest|Setup a Windows guest]]
* [[QEMU/OS2WarpV3 guest|Setup a OS2WarpV3 guest]]
