<big>'''Hello fellow contributor!'''</big>

Thank you for helping the Gentoo project and sending a Pull Request via Github! Contributions are always welcome and highly appreciated.

Before hitting the "Create pull request" button on Github, we would like to remind you a few rules to facilitate the process as much as possible, make our lives (and yours!) easier and have your contribution quickly accepted.

We won't accept PRs which do not follow these guidelines and will remind you about them on the PR.

=== Commit format ===
Commits must respect a special format. If you've already taken a look at the repository log, most commits begin with "CATEGORY/PN: some message". We expect you to format your commits the same way. For further details about this step, please take a look at this link: [[Gentoo_git_workflow#Commit_message_format|Commit message format]].

=== Manifest files ===
If your PR bumps a package, commit the updated Manifest file along with all your changes. If you don't, Larry the Cow, the Github QA bot, won't like that and will issue QA reports filled with errors.

=== Use of repoman ===
We strongly encourage the use of the [[Repoman|repoman]] utility (installed with {{Package|sys-apps/portage}} itself) which performs various QA checks against ebuilds, as well as updates the manifest and pre-formats a commit message for you. One of the first checks done on an ebuild is to verify it with the command <code>repoman -dx full</code>, so you should at least run this before committing. You can also use repoman to make commits using <code>repoman -dx commit</code>. When using repoman, run it from the lowest point in the repository possible (as in, within the ebuild directory) otherwise it may try checking all ebuilds below the current directory!

=== Separate (or "atomic") commits ===
Avoid big, fat, massive commits. If your PR involves a version bump as well as cleaning up an old version and modifying the metadata.xml file, do commit these three changes separately. We need to go back in time in case something goes wrong and therefore, having separate commits for each and every change happening in the repository is the only way to achieve that.

=== External links ===
Feel free to add as much information as possible: upstream forums, mailing lists, discussions, changelogs, etc. Your commit will appear in the ChangeLog file.

=== Bug report ===
If your PR solves a bug report, mention it using the header <code>Gentoo-Bug: https://bugs.gentoo.org/12345</code>.

=== Ping maintainers ===
Once your PR is filed, if the maintainer has an account set up on Github, ping him/her using <code>@</code> followed by his/her user account. We've created groups to ping a project at once: for instance <code>@gentoo/gnome</code> will ping the gnome team, <code>@gentoo/java</code> the Java team and so forth. Not all Gentoo projects have been mapped as Github group yet. In any case, maintainers must know the existence of your PR. You can see a package's maintainers by either looking at {{Path|${PORTDIR}/${category}/${package-name}/metadata.xml}} or using <code>equery meta $category/$package</code> from {{Package|app-portage/gentoolkit}}.

Happy Githubing!
