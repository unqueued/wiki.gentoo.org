SELinux supports multiple networking related access controls. Alongside the TCP and UDP socket support, it also supports packet labeling (through SECMARK) and even peer labeling where the label of a process on one system is reflected in the data communication towards the other system, providing end-to-end policy decisions to be taken.

== Introduction ==

=== TCP and UDP socket support ===

The default access controls for networking by SELinux are based on the labels assigned to TCP and UDP ports and sockets. For instance, the TCP port 80 is labeled with <code>http_port_t</code> (and class <code>tcp_socket</code>). Access towards this port is then governed through SELinux access controls, such as ''name_connect'' and ''name_bind''.

When an application is connecting to a port, the ''name_connect'' permission is checked. However, when an application binds to the port, the ''name_bind'' permission is checked.
