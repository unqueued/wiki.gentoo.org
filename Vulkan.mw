Vulkan is [[Article description::a next-generation graphics API created by The Khronos Group.]] Its focus is to provide 3D graphics cross-platforms in a code once run anywhere fashion.

For Vulkan support, Gentoo has a basic package {{Package|media-libs/vulkan-loader}} which provides the {{Path|libvulkan.so.1}} shared object file.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=media-libs/vulkan-loader}}

To compile the open source Vulkan drivers the <code>vulkan</code> USE flag must be enabled for {{Package|media-libs/mesa}}. The following list shows the Vulkan supported GPU drivers in Mesa:

{| class="table table-striped table-condensed"
|-
! Driver !! Vulkan support?
|-
| radeon/r600 || {{No|No}}
|-
| radeonsi || {{Yes|via radv}} 
|-
| i915 || {{No|No}}
|-
| i965 || {{Yes|via anvil, see [[Intel]] for details}}
|-
| nouveau || {{No|No}}
|-
|}

The following alternative, closed-source drivers exist. These also provide Vulkan support:

* {{See also|AMDGPU-PRO}}
* {{See also|NVidia/nvidia-drivers}}

You can check the [https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/ (unofficial) Vulkan hardware database] for a list of detailed GPU hardware capabilities for Vulkan.

== Troubleshooting == 

=== Wrong ELF class ===
This error that may appear when running {{c|vulkaninfo}} diagnostic tool from {{Package|dev-util/vulkan-tools}} and used for [[Vulkan]] debugging. 
<pre>
 ERROR: [Loader Message] Code 0 : /usr/lib32/libvulkan_intel.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32
 ERROR: [Loader Message] Code 0 : /usr/lib32/libvulkan_radeon.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32
</pre>

Possible causes and solutions are:
# This issue is present if vulkan is compiled with <code>ABI_X86="32 64"</code> on a multilib amd64 system. This error can be ignored.
# Build may be missing proper support
#* recompile vulkan+mesa+(nvidia,intel,amd driver of your choice) on sane make.conf and package.*
#* check {{c|strace}} of {{c|vulkanifo}} which is present in vulkan-tools.
