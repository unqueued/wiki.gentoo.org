Vulkan is [[Article description::a next-generation graphics API created by The Khronos Group.]] Its focus is to provide 3D graphics cross-platforms in a code once run anywhere fashion.

For Vulkan support, Gentoo has a basic package {{Package|media-libs/vulkan-loader}} which provides the {{Path|libvulkan.so.1}} shared object file.

== Installation ==
STUB

== USE flags ==

{{USEflag|package=media-libs/vulkan-loader}}

To compile the open source Vulkan drivers the <code>vulkan</code> USE flag must be enabled for {{Package|media-libs/mesa}}. The following list shows the Vulkan supported GPU drivers in Mesa:

{| class="table table-striped table-condensed"
|-
! Driver !! Vulkan support?
|-
| radeon/r600 || {{No|No}}
|-
| radeonsi || {{Yes|via radv}} 
|-
| i915 || {{No|No}}
|-
| i965 || {{Yes|via anvil, see [[Intel]] for details}}
|-
| nouveau || {{No|No}}
|-
|}

The following alternative, closed-source drivers exist. These also provide Vulkan support:

* {{See also|AMDGPU-PRO}}
* {{See also|NVidia/nvidia-drivers}}

You can check the [https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/ (unofficial) Vulkan hardware database] for a list of detailed GPU hardware capabilities for Vulkan.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Vulkan doesn't work on user and has issues in applications ===

Ask on #gentoo, get laugh at for using vulkaninfo "toy".. '''TRIGGERED'''

Change {{path|/usr/src/linux/.config}} on <code>CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU=m</code> instead of <code>CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU=y</code>. if <code>y</code> is set then vulkan-loader has issues with functionality on user and wierd glitches in applications.
