Currently, the Gentoo tree has a basic package {{Package|media-libs/vulkan-loader}} which provides {{Path|libvulkan.so.1}}:
{{USEflag|package=media-libs/vulkan-loader}}

If you want the open source Vulkan drivers, you need to enable the '''vulkan''' USE flag in {{Package|media-libs/mesa}}. The following list shows the vulkan supported in Mesa:
{| class="table table-striped table-condensed"
|-
! Driver !! Vulkan support?
|-
| radeon/r600 || {{No}}
|-
| radeonsi || {{Yes|via radv}} 
|-
| i915 || {{No}}
|-
| i965 || {{Yes|via anvil, see [[Intel]] for details}}
|-
| nouveau || {{No}}
|}

The following alternative driver exist:
* [[AMDGPU-PRO]], official closed-source driver for AMD hardware
* [[NVidia/nvidia-drivers]], official closed-source driver for Nvidia hardware


You can check the [http://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/ (inofficial) Vulkan hardware database] for a list of detailed GPU hardware capabilites for Vulkan.
