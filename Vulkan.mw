For Vulkan support Gentoo has a basic package {{Package|media-libs/vulkan-loader}} which provides {{Path|libvulkan.so.1}} shared object file.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=media-libs/vulkan-loader}}

To compile the open source Vulkan drivers the <code>vulkan</code> USE flag must be enabled for {{Package|media-libs/mesa}}. The following list shows the vulkan supported GPU drivers in Mesa:

|-
! Driver !! Vulkan support?
|-
| radeon/r600 || {{No}}
|-
| radeonsi || {{Yes|via radv}} 
|-
| i915 || {{No}}
|-
| i965 || {{Yes|via anvil, see [[Intel]] for details}}
|-
| nouveau || {{No}}
|}

The following alternative closed-source drivers exist. These also provideo Vulkan support:

* [[AMDGPU-PRO]], official closed-source driver for AMD hardware.
* [[NVidia/nvidia-drivers]], official closed-source driver for Nvidia hardware


You can check the [http://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/ (inofficial) Vulkan hardware database] for a list of detailed GPU hardware capabilities for Vulkan.
