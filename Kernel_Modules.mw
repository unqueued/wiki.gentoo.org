This page is meant to help picking between compile-in-kernel ("<*>") and compile-as-module ("<M>") when configuring a [[kernel]].

== Advantages ==
A module ..
* Is loadable without reboot (at least most of them).
* Results in smaller kernel memory footprint (when the module is not loaded).
* Can be loaded on demand by [[udev]] (for example DVB drivers for DVB stick).
* Allows easy reloading of kernel drivers in case of module crash.
* Allows specifying module-specific parameters in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/modules}}

== Drawbacks ==
Using a module ..
* May require an update of the [[initramfs]] for modules needed early in the boot process (i.e. [[filesystem]] drivers).
* May result in performance losses due to the addition of an API layer and slightly more memory usage.

Also:
* Beware of file system module X located on a partition formatted with X (unbootable system at worst).
