==== Features ====

* Distributed live patch building
** Works as client server live patch build model
* Incremental live patch
** You can build live patch over the previous one
* Automatic live patch for security CVE
** Getting kernel CVE from https://github.com/nluedtke/linux_kernel_cves

==== Implementation ====

* elivepatch-client
** Client to be run on the machine where we want to install the live patch.
* elivepatch-server
** RESTful API for building the live patch.

==== Usage ====

===== Elivepatch-server =====
This is for the machine that will build the live patch

Installation

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask elivepatch-server}}

This will install the init.d file under /etc/init.d/elivepatch
You can start elivepatch-server on startup with
{{RootCmd|rc-config add elivepatch-server default}}

===== Elivepatch-client =====
This is for the machine that will request to build the live patch

Installation

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask elivepatch-client}}

====== One time livepatch build ======

{{RootCmd|elivepatch  --config <file.config> --patch <example.patch> --url <elivepatch-server_url:elivepatch-server_port>}}

====== CVE livepatch ======

{{RootCmd|elivepatch  --cve --kernel <kernel_version> --url <elivepatch-server-url:port>}}
