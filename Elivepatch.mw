Flexible Distributed Linux Kernel Live Patching

[https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/livepatch/livepatch.txt livepatch] is a Linux kernel facility that allows to build a kernel module to update a running kernel without requiring a reboot.

'''Elivepatch''' is a client-server infrastructure to automate the creation and distribution of those modules.

[[File:ZDzIl3CEP1L6U6XI-B43E4.png|thumbnail|elivepatch diagram]]

=== Use cases ===

* Resource-constrained updates
** Distributed live patch building
** Incremental live patch (You can build live patch over the previous one)
* Automatic no-reboot updates for [https://github.com/nluedtke/linux_kernel_cves security CVE]

== Setup ==

The software is mainly two components:

* '''elivepatch-client''': Client to be run on the machines to be updated.
* '''elivepatch-server''': Server in charge of building the livepatch modules.

The two use a RESTful API for receiving the kernel ''configuration'' and a source 'diff' and generate a ''livepatch'' module out of it using [[kpatch]]

=== Server setup ===

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask elivepatch-server}}

This will install the init.d file under {{Path|/etc/init.d/elivepatch}} and the conf.d under {{Path|/etc/conf.d/elivepatch}}.<br>
From the conf.d file you can change the elivepatch daemon user and permission (by default is {{c|root}}).<br>
You can start elivepatch-server on machine startup with:

{{RootCmd|rc-config add elivepatch-server default}}

The machine will need to have enough space to build several kernels and the toolchains used to build the original kernel.

=== Client setup ===

{{RootCmd|emerge --ask elivepatch-client}}

The client is as well a Python program.

== Usage examples ==

=== One time livepatch build ===

{{RootCmd|elivepatch  --config <file.config> --patch <example.patch> --url <elivepatch-server_url:elivepatch-server_port>}}

The '''example.patch''' is a diff from the original kernel sources the '''file.config''' belongs to (the elivepatch-client figures out the kernel version from it).

The command will contact the elivepatch server and request a livepatch module matching the patch provided.

=== CVE livepatch ===

{{RootCmd|elivepatch  --cve --kernel <kernel_version> --url <elivepatch-server-url:port>}}

It will automatically produce a '''cve.patch''' from the CVE advisories for the current running kernel and request a ''livepatch'' module.

It could be used as a cron job command to keep an always-on machine up to date security-wise.

== Limitations ==

=== Patch creation ===

''elivepatch'' uses '''kpatch''' under the hood and the system has the following limitations:
* [https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/blob/master/doc/patch-author-guide.md#change-the-code-which-uses-the-data-structure Patch that change data structure]
* [https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/blob/master/doc/patch-author-guide.md#use-a-kpatch-load-hook Change content of existing variable]
* [https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/blob/master/doc/patch-author-guide.md#use-a-shadow-variable Add field to existing data structure]
* Init code changes are incompatible with kpatch
* [https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/blob/master/doc/patch-author-guide.md#header-file-changes Header file changes]
* [https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/blob/master/doc/patch-author-guide.md#dealing-with-unexpected-changed-functions Dealing with unexpected changed functions]
* [https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/blob/master/doc/patch-author-guide.md#removing-references-to-static-local-variables Removing references to static local variables]
* [https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/blob/master/doc/patch-author-guide.md#code-removal Code removal]

=== Toolchain pinning ===

The '''livepatch''' generation process needs a toolchain matching the one used to build the original kernel. Depending on the number of system to serve, this will require a large collection of gcc.

=== Security concerns ===

Automated live patching creation needs to trust the '''diff''' provided. It is advised to keep the process containerized.
For this purpose [[Docker]] images are being worked on.
