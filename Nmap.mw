Nmap, which stands for '''N'''etwork '''Map'''per, was written by Gordon Lyon. In practical use, this tool can be used to check for open ports, what is running on those ports, and header information from the daemons servicing the open ports.

==Installing NMap==

=== Emerge ===
Installing Nmap is simple; no configuration should be required. Pay attention to the optional USE flags in case there are some "non-stock" features that would be good to include in the install. See the USE flags list below before running the following command:

{{Emerge|net-analyzer/nmap}}

A quick way to add many USE flags at once for Nmap:

{{RootCmd|<nowiki>echo ">=net-analyzer/nmap-6.25 gtk ipv6 lua nls ssl ncat ndiff nmap-update nping" >> /etc/portage/package.use</nowiki>}}

=== USE flags ===
{{USEflag|package=net-analyzer/nmap
|gtk++yes
|ipv6++yes
|lua++yes
|ncat
|ndiff
|nls
|nmap-update
|nping
|ssl++yes
}}

{{Important|If additional USE flags are added at a later date be sure to rebuild Nmaps binaries by recompiling with the <tt>--changed-use</tt> option!}}

== Using NMap ==
There are many ways to use the Nmap command. The following section will provide numerous examples in order for users to become familiar with using Nmap.

To see if port 80 was open at example.com, run nmap with the <tt>-p</tt> option to specify the port:
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 80}}
To check multiple ports, port 80 and port 8080 for example, separate each port with a comma:
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 80,8080,443}}
To check for open SQL ports, run:
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 1433,3306,5432}}
To check a wide range of ports, such as ports 1-1000, separate the low-end & high-end of the range with a - (dash):
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 1-1000}}
Specify multiple port ranges by:
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 6660-6670,6690-6700}}
To find out if a server was running an IRC daemon, and then find out information about that IRC daemon do the same as above but add the <tt>-sV</tt> option:
{{Cmd|nmap -sV irc.afraidirc.net -p 6660-6670,6690-6700|output=<pre>

The output above shows the hostname as defined in the IRC daemon configuration, as well as the IRC daemon version name. In this case, it happens to be ''Charybdis'', which is a fork of ratbox. ircd-seven is also a fork of ratbox, so Nmap is unable to tell exactly which IRC daemon is in use. It is capable of providing the IRC daemon "family".

Similar port scans can be invoked in order to get information about web servers, or other services running on a target machines. The following example will get the web server and the operating system running on a machine at Google.com:

{{Cmd|nmap -sV -p 80 google.com|output=<pre>

=== OS Fingerprinting ===
To fingerprint an operating system, use:
{{RootCmd|nmap -O -v localhost}}
