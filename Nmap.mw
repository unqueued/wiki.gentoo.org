Nmap, which stands for Network Mapper, was written by Gordon Lyon. In practical use, this tool can be used to check for open ports, what is running on those ports, and can be used to retrieve header information from the daemons servicing the open ports.

==Installing NMap==
=== Uses ===
{{USEflag|package=net-analyzer/nmap
|gtk++yes
|ipv6++yes
|lua++yes
|ncat
|ndiff
|nls
|nmap-update
|nping
|ssl++yes
}}

=== Emerge ===
Installing nmap is simple, and no configuration should be required. You should of course pay attention to your use flags, in case there are some non-stock features that you might like to include in your install.
{{RootCmd|<nowiki>echo '>=net-analyzer/nmap-6.25 gtk ipv6 lua nls ssl ncat ndiff nmap-update nping' >> /etc/portage/package.use</nowiki>}}
{{RootCmd|emerge -av net-analyzer/nmap}}

==Using NMap==
Open up a command prompt & try a few of these examples out to get the hang of using nmap.<br />
Let's say you wanted to see if port 80 was open at example.com, you would run nmap with the -p trigger to specify the port you want to check.
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 80}}
If you wanted to check multiple ports, like 80 & 8080 then you would separate each port with a comma.
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 80,8080,443}}
To check if sql ports are open
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 1433,3306,5432}}
Let's say you wanted to check a range of ports, such as ports 1-1000, you would just separate the low-end & high-end of the range with a -.
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 1-1000}}
You can also specify multiple ranges like this:
{{Cmd|nmap example.com -p 6660-6670,6690-6700}}
If we wanted to find out if a server was running an IRCd, and then find out information about that IRCd we would do the same as above, but add the -sV trigger as well, like so:
{{Cmd|nmap -sV irc.afraidirc.net -p 6660-6670,6690-6700}}
This command would then output something like the following:

The output above shows us the hostname as defined in the IRCd configuration, as well as the IRCd version name. In this case, it happens to be Charybdis, which is a fork of ratbox. ircd-seven is also a fork from ratbox, so nmap is unable to tell exactly which IRCd is in use, but rather give you the IRCd "family".<br />
<br />
We can do the same to get information about webservers, and other services running on a target machine.
In this example we will get the webserver & OS running on Google.com:
{{Cmd|nmap -sV -p 80 google.com}}
The above command will give this output:
<pre>Starting Nmap 6.25 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2013-09-07 20:16 CDT

=== Os Fingerprinting ===
To fingerprint an os:
{{RootCmd|nmap -O -v localhost}}

==Easter Egg==
At least one Easter Egg is contained within nmap, if you find more please document them!
{{Cmd|nmap -oS - google.com}}
