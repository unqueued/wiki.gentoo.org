{{DISPLAYTITLE:profiles/repo_name}}
The '''profiles/repo_name''' file (''obligatory'') specifies the repository name. The name assigned there is used by the package manager to refer to the contents of the repository.

== File format ==

The ''repo_name'' file is a plain, ASCII text file containing the repository name on its only line.

{{File|profiles/repo_name|Example for repository named ''my-repo''|<pre>my-repo</pre>}}

== layman repository list ==

It is required that repository names in ''repo_name'' files are the same as repository names on the layman repository list. In the future, an automated check will be added to enforce that as requested in {{Bug|382603}}.
