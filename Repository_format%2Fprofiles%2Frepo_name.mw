{{DISPLAYTITLE:Repository format/profiles/repo_name}}

The {{Path|profiles/repo_name}} file (''obligatory'') specifies the repository name. The name assigned there is used by the package manager to refer to the contents of the repository. In case a [[Repository_format/metadata/layout.conf#repo-name|repo-name]] key is given in [[Repository_format/metadata/layout.conf|metadata/layout.conf]] that one takes precedence.

== File format ==

The ''repo_name'' file is a plain, ASCII text file containing the repository name on its only line.

{{FileBox|filename=profiles/repo_name|title=Example for repository named ''my-repo''|1=
my-repo
}}

For configuration files or sections in  [[:/etc/portage/repos.conf#Format|/etc/portage/repos.conf]] it is recommended that <code>[repository_name]</code> is the same as the name specified here.

== layman repository list ==

It is required that repository names in {{Path|repo_name}} files are the same as repository names on the layman repository list. In the future, an automated check will be added to enforce that as requested in {{Bug|382603}}.
