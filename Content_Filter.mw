== Planning ==
In order to build a successful content filter, some questions need answering. How many users will be filtered? What will be filtered? How will it be filtered?
== Single Machines And Small Networks ==
For single machines and small networks I find that Tinyproxy and Dansguardian work best.<br />
Tinyproxy is a very lightweight and easy to configure proxy server. Dansguardian actually does all the filtering work, but is unable to fetch pages by itself, this is where Tinyproxy comes in.<br />
