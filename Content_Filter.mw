== Planning ==
In order to build a successful content filter, some questions need answering. How many users will be filtered? What will be filtered? How will it be filtered?
== Single Machines And Small Networks ==
For single machines and small networks I find that Tinyproxy and Dansguardian work best.<br />
Tinyproxy is a very lightweight and easy to configure proxy server. Dansguardian actually does all the filtering work, but is unable to fetch pages by itself, this is where Tinyproxy comes in.<br />
A user will open their web browser and request a web page, this request typically travels over port 80, we'll redirect port 80 to a port that Dansguardian is listening on, then Dansguardian will forward the request onto Tinyproxy, who will then actually go out and fetch the web page.<br />
=== Installing and Configuring Tinyproxy ===
By default a few USE flags are set for Tinyproxy, most are not needed for this guide but don't hurt either. However be sure that the '''transparent-proxy''' USE flag is '''not''' set. It is not compatible with this guide.<br />
First, install Tinyproxy:
{{RootCmd|emerge tinyproxy}}
