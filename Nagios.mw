'''Nagios''' offers complete monitoring and alerting for servers, switches, applications, and services.

== Install Nagios ==
Decide whether you want to use lighttpd or apache2 as the nagios frontend, and enable the preferred webserver USE flag for nagios.

{{RootCmd|<pre>USE="exif gd truetype" emerge apache2  (Required to specify "gd" USE flag, else emerge is blocked)</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|<pre>USE="nagios-ping nagios-ssh" emerge net-analyzer/nagios-plugins (Some preferred plugins)</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|<pre>USE="apache2" emerge net-analyzer/nagios-core</pre>}}

== Apache Web Server Configuration ==
Follow the instructions within the PHP Gentoo Wiki.

You'll need to enable the NAGIOS and PHP modules and test PHP works.

{{File|/etc/conf.d/apache2||<pre>
APACHE2_OPTS="-D DEFAULT_VHOST -D INFO -D SSL -D SSL_DEFAULT_VHOST -D LANGUAGE -D NAGIOS -D PHP5"</pre>}}

== Specify Allowed Users ==
Edit the /etc/groups file and add the user name(s) to the nagios group, whom are allowed access to the Nagios service.

Once done, completely log-out from all shells and relogin for the update to /etc/groups to occur.

== Start the Services ==
{{RootCmd|rc-update add nagios default}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add apache2 default}}

{{RootCmd|rc-service nagios start}}
{{RootCmd|rc-service apache2 start}}

== Navigate to the Nagios Web Page ==
Open your browser and navigate to "http://localhost/nagios"

== Bugs ==
===Error: Could not open CGI config file '/etc/nagios/cgi.cfg' for reading!===
Currently getting an "Error: Could not open CGI config file '/etc/nagios/cgi.cfg' for reading!" when navigating to the system monitor related pages.  According to /etc/group, user is within the nagios group.  However, questionable as to whether the /usr/lib/nagios/cgi-bin/ is accessible or executable through the apache service dameon.  But according to the Gentoo Ebuild Nagios installed "/etc/apache2/modules.d/99_nagios3.conf" file, everything should just work without any htaccess files, etc etc.  Everything should just work without logging in, with the option of having to only log in as root, similar to Cupsd web interface.
