'''Nagios''' offers complete monitoring and alerting for servers, switches, applications, and services.

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===
Decide which web server you want to use and set it up:
* [[Apache]] with PHP
* [[Lighttpd]] with [[PHP]]

=== net-analyzer/nagios ===
Set the right USE flag for {{Package|net-analyzer/nagios-core}}:
{{USEflag|package=net-analyzer/nagios-core
|apache2
|lighttpd
}}

Also enable the right USE flags for the plugins you want for {{Package|net-analyzer/nagios-plugins}}.

Finally install {{Package|net-analyzer/nagios}}:
{{Emerge|nagios}}

== Configuration ==

=== Apache ===
Enable the Nagios module for Apache:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/apache2||<pre>
APACHE2_OPTS="... -D NAGIOS"</pre>}}

Since Nagios requires [[PHP]] for its web interface, you may have to enable it as well if you haven't done so already. One way is to simply add <code>-D PHP5</code> to <code>APACHE2_OPTS</code> and edit <code>/etc/php/apache2-phpYOUR_PHP_VERSION/php.ini</code>. This should be fine unless you need PHP for purposes other than hosting Nagios on the host you configure it.

If you are using Apache 2.4 (which is still marked unstable as of June 2013) you may have to modify <code>/etc/apache2/modules.d/99_nagios3.conf</code> to fit the new authorization directives of Apache 2.4.

Remember to add the <code>apache</code> user to group <code>nagios</code>:

{{RootCmd|usermod -a -G nagios apache}}

Finally, restart the Apache service:
{{RootCmd|rc-service apache restart}}

=== Lighttpd ===
Enable the Nagios config for Lighttpd:
{{File|/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf||<pre>
include "nagios.conf"</pre>}}

Configure athentication, more option on how to set this up can be found in the Lighttpd docs
{{File|/etc/lighttpd/nagios.conf||<pre>
$HTTP["url"] =~ "nagios" {
    auth.backend ="plain"    # The password is stored as plain text as user:password in...
    auth.backend.plain.userfile = "/etc/nagios/passwd"  # this file
    auth.require = ( "" => (
        "method" => "digest",
        "realm" => "nagios",
        "require" => "user=nagiosadmin"
        )
    )
    setenv.add-environment = ( "REMOTE_USER" => "user" )
}
</pre>}}

Restart the Lighttpd service:
{{RootCmd|rc-service lighttpd restart}}

=== Permissions ===
Add the user name(s) to the nagios group, whom are allowed access to the Nagios service:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a YOUR_USER nagios}}

Once done, completely log-out from all shells and relogin for the update to apply.

=== Boot service ===
You can now start Nagios:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/nagios start}}

To start Nagios  at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add nagios default}}

== Testing ==
Open your browser and navigate to "http://localhost/nagios".

== Troubleshooting  ==
