Typespeed's idea is ripped from ztspeed, a DOS game made by Zorlim. The Idea behind the game is rather easy: type words that are flying by from left to right as fast as you can. If you miss 10 or more words, game is over. You can play typespeed for your own or with a friend using TCP/IPv4 (Network Head2Head).
