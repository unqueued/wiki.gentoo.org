{{Lowercase title}}
'''evdev''' is the open source input driver for many input devices like keyboards, mice, joysticks and more.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need [[USB]] support, if you have an USB input device. Also you need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Input device support  --->
        <*>   Event interface

        If a mouse is connected to a PS/2 port:
        [*]   Mice  --->
              <*>   PS/2 mouse

       If a keyboard is connected to a PS/2 port:
        -*-   Keyboards  --->
              <*>   AT keyboard

    If an input device is connected to an USB port:
    [*] HID Devices  --->
        -*-   Generic HID support
        <*>   USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support
</pre>}}

=== Driver ===
{{INPUT_DEVICES|evdev}}

== Configuration ==

=== Keyboard layout ===
To set the default layout copy the file {{Path|10-evdev.conf}} to {{Path|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d}} and edit the keyboard section, e.g. for a german layout:
{{RootCmd|cp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/}}
{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf||<pre>
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "evdev keyboard catchall"
        ...
        Driver "evdev"
        Option "xkb_layout" "de"
EndSection
</pre>}}
