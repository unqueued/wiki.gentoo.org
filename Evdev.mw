'''evdev''' ({{package|x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev}}) is the open source input driver for many input devices like keyboards, mice, joysticks and more.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

You need [[USB]] support, if you have an USB input device. Also you need to activate the following kernel options:

{{KernelBox|title=PS/2 keyboard/mouse support|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    Input device support  --->
        <*>   Event interface
        [*]   Mice  --->
              <*>   PS/2 mouse
        -*-   Keyboards  --->
              <*>   AT keyboard
}}

{{KernelBox|title=USB input device support|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    HID support  --->
        <*> HID bus support
        <*> Generic HID driver
            USB HID support  --->
                <*> USB HID transport layer
}}

Some USB mice (e.g. Logitech G5 and Razer Naga 2014) additionally need the following option:

{{KernelBox|title=Improved transaction support|1=<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support  --->
        [*]   Improved Transaction Translator scheduling
</pre>}}

== Configuration ==

=== Keyboard layout ===

To set the default layout copy the file {{Path|10-evdev.conf}} to {{Path|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d}} and edit the keyboard section, e.g. for a German layout:

{{RootCmd|cp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/}}
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf|lang=xorg.conf|1=
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "evdev keyboard catchall"
        ...
        Driver "evdev"
        Option "xkb_layout" "de"
EndSection
}}
