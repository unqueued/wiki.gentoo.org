'''MATE''' (pronounced to rhyme with ''latte'', not ''late'') is a [[Wikipedia:Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[GNOME|GNOME 2]] desktop environment that is available through Portage. According to the MATE team's manifesto, they aim to keep a traditional desktop look and feel, maintain an open development model, have an open relationship with GNU/Linux distributions, and serve as a good alternative for lower-end hardware.

{{Note|MATE bugs can be reported at https://bugs.gentoo.org — please provide sufficient details (how to reproduce, emerge info, logs, error messages).}}

== Installation ==

=== Keywording ===

MATE is available for {{Keyword|x86}} and {{Keyword|amd64}}. As of October 2017, testing versions are available for {{Keyword|~arm}}. Adding support for {{Keyword|~ppc}} is being considered. The status of MATE keywording can be tracked in {{Bug|508072}}.

=== USE flags ===

First enable or disable desired USE flags for {{Package|mate-base/mate}}.

{{USEflag|package=mate-base/mate}}

=== Packages ===

To install the MATE desktop environment meta package run the following command:

{{Emerge|params=--ask --changed-use|mate-base/mate}}

=== Additional software ===

==== Caja File Extensions ====

To install Caja extensions run the following command:
{{Emerge| mate-extra/caja-extensions}}

Caja extensions include the following:

; {{Path|mate-file-manager-open-terminal}} : Open terminals in arbitrary local paths
; {{Path|mate-file-manager-sendto}} : Integrate email clients and Pidgin into the Caja file manager
; {{Path|mate-file-manager-image-converter}} : Mass resize or rotate images
; {{Path|mate-file-manager-share}} : Quickly share a folder from the Caja file manager

== Usage ==

Either a display manager ([[SLiM]], [[GNOME/gdm|GDM]], [[LightDM]], etc.) or the <tt>startx</tt> command can be used to start MATE during system the system boot process.

=== Display manager (DM) ===

To make the display manager work specify a MATE session (mate-session) in the configuration of the display manager; some perform this action interactively, others will need to have a configuration file modified. The default session can also often be changed by setting <code>XSESSION="Mate"</code> in {{Path|/etc/env.d/90xsession}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/env.d/90xsession|title=Enabling MATE|lang=bash|1=
XSESSION="Mate"
}}

The MATE team recommends [[LightDM]] as the display manager. Install {{Package|x11-misc/lightdm}}:

{{Emerge|x11-misc/lightdm}}

==== OpenRC ==== <!--T:20-->

<!--T:21-->
Set LightDM as the default display manager:

<!--T:22-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/xdm|lang=bash|1=
DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"
}}

<!--T:23-->
To start LightDM on boot, add dbus & xdm to the default runlevel:

<!--T:24-->
{{RootCmd|rc-update add dbus default}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

<!--T:25-->
To start LightDM now:

<!--T:26-->
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus start}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/xdm start}}

==== systemd ==== <!--T:27-->

<!--T:28-->
To start LightDM on boot:

<!--T:29-->
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable lightdm}}

<!--T:30-->
To start LightDM now:

<!--T:31-->
{{RootCmd|systemctl start lightdm}}

=== Manual start ===

To start MATE manually create a {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} file in a user's home directory. Make its contents as follows:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=exec mate-session}}

Note that a {{c|ck-launch-session}} and/or {{c|dbus-launch}} may be needed between {{c|exec mate-session}} for ConsoleKit and/or DBUS communication to work, for example:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch mate-session}}

== Configuration ==

=== Compositing ===

Compositing is ''not'' enabled by default. To enable compositing run {{Path|System → Preferences → Windows}} and click the tick box alongside '''Enable software compositing window manager''' in the {{Path|General}} tab.

=== Window centering ===

Window centering is ''not'' enabled by default. To enable window centering run {{Path|System → Preferences → Windows}} and click the tick box alongside '''Center new windows''' in the {{Path|Placement}} tab.

=== Window snapping ===

Window snapping is ''not'' enabled by default. To enable window snapping run {{Path|System → Preferences → Windows}} and click on the tick box alongside '''Enable side by side tiling''' in the {{Path|Placement}} tab.

=== Change applications menu icon ===

The applications menu icon is set to {{Path|start-here}} by default. To use a different icon, copy your icon to a folder such as {{Path|/usr/local/share/pixmaps}} and execute the following:

{{Cmd|$ gsettings set org.mate.panel.menubar icon-name <icon>}} 

Where <code>icon</code> is the name of the icon without the file extension. Restart MATE panel. 

=== Show or hide desktop icons ===

Desktop icons are enabled by default. They can be hidden or shown individually using {{Path|dconf}}.

==== Hide all desktop icons ====

{{Cmd|dconf write /org/mate/desktop/background/show-desktop-icons false}}

==== Hide individual icons ====

To hide the computer icon:

{{Cmd|dconf write /org/mate/caja/desktop/computer-icon-visible false}}

To hide the user directory icon:

{{Cmd|dconf write /org/mate/caja/desktop/home-icon-visible false}}

To hide the network icon:

{{Cmd|dconf write /org/mate/caja/desktop/network-icon-visible false}}

To hide the trash icon:

{{Cmd|dconf write /org/mate/caja/desktop/trash-icon-visible false}}

To hide mounted volumes:

{{Cmd|dconf write /org/mate/caja/desktop/volumes-visible false}}

Alternatively, {{Path|dconf Editor}} may be used to show or hide desktop icons. Navigate to {{Path|org → mate → caja → desktop}}.

=== Autostart ===

MATE is capable of automatically running binaries or scripts on a per-user basis.

Autostart entries can be added via {{Path|System → Preferences → Start Applications}}.

From the command-line, entries can be added in the {{Path|~/.config/autostart}} directory as XDG formatted {{Path|.desktop}} files. Be sure to include a line that says <code>X-MATE-Autostart-enabed=true</code>. For example:

{{FileBox|title=MATE autostart example|filename=~/.config/autostart/example.desktop|lang=ini|1=
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=/path/to/executable
Hidden=false
Name=Autostart example
Comment=This file shows that the line below is needed for MATE to autostart an executable
X-MATE-Autostart-enabled=true
}}

== FAQ ==

=== Does MATE rely on a specific service manager or init system? ===

No, MATE has been tested to work with both OpenRC and systemd and might work on other service managers and init systems too (untested, but no known reason for it to break); systemd support was added in [http://mate-desktop.org/fr/blog/2013-04-02-mate-1-6-released/ release 1.6].

=== Can MATE be installed side-by-side GNOME packages or do they block? ===

As the MATE packages use their own categories, it is possible to have MATE and GNOME 3 installed at the same time which allows you to test either; taking it even a step further, if you change MATE to not have a top panel (as it gets hidden under the GNOME 3 shell) you can even start mate-session within GNOME 3 and run MATE and GNOME 3 at the same time.

=== How do I enable the panel shadow? ===

Due to a race condition, the panel shadow does not appear after logging in to the MATE desktop, even with compositing enabled. You must first copy {{Path|/usr/share/applications/mate-panel.desktop}} to {{Path|~/.local/share/applications/mate-panel.desktop}}. Then set {{Path|X-MATE-Autostart-Phase}} to {{Path|Applications}}, and add a delay:

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/applications/mate-panel.desktop|lang=bash|1=
X-MATE-Autostart-Phase=Applications
X-MATE-Autostart-Delay=2
X-MATE-Provides=windowmanager
X-MATE-Autostart-Notify=true
}}

You may need to adjust the delay as needed. Finally, restart Marco with the following command:

{{Cmd| $ marco --replace}}

=== Using MATE with dual screens ===

When using MATE desktop with multiple screens, it must be emerged with the <code>xinerama</code> USE flag enabled. Specifically, the 
window manager that is powering mate-desktop, which is {{Package|x11-wm/marco}}. This will solve issues like [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7583398.html windows being maximized over both screens in MATE desktop].

=== Using MATE with Android phones ===

To connect Android devices and open them in {{Package|mate-base/caja}} you need to compile {{Package|gnome-base/gvfs}} with the <code>mtp</code> USE flag.

=== Can I replace the default screen-shot tool with X? ===

{{Path|mate-screenshot}} is provided in {{Package|mate-extra/mate-utils}} provides basic screenshot capabilities. If you don't like it and need a 
more advanced tool, like {{Package|x11-misc/shutter}} you can replace the default behavior of the {{Path|Print Screen}} button by editing the following configurations option with dconf-edtior:

{{Path|org.mate.marco.keybinding-commands.command-screenshot $your-command}}

If you feel comfortable doing this with the command line you can do:

{{Cmd|dconf write /org/mate/marco/keybinding-commands/command-screenshot \"foo\"}}

or with:

{{Cmd|gsettings set org.mate.Marco.keybinding-commands command-screenshot 'foo'}}

=== Suspend and Hibernate buttons are missing from the shutdown dialog ===

If only "Restart Cancel Shutdown" buttons appear in the dialog, make sure you compile {{Package|mate-base/mate-session-manager}} with upower enabled, {{Package|mate-extra/mate-power-manager}} with pm-utils flag.

== Removal ==

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|mate-base/mate $(qlist -IC 'mate-base/*')}}

To remove all packages with the name MATE ({{c|[[eix]]}} required):

{{Emerge|params+=--depclean|$(eix -I -# mate)}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== GLib-GObject-ERROR: object GsmAutostartApp 0x73ca40 finalized while still in-construction ===

When you get this error (see {{Path|~/.materc-errors}}), it is usually preceded by a warning, fixing the warning could fix the problem; for example, when I get to see:

{{CodeBox|1=mate-session[881]: WARNING: Could not parse desktop file /home/username/.config/autostart/some-naughty-broken-program.desktop: Key file does not have key 'Name'
mate-session[881]: GLib-GObject-ERROR: object GsmAutostartApp 0x73ca40 finalized while still in-construction}}

In this case, you can resolve this by moving away the desktop file or fixing it up by adding the Name key. If you want a clean start, you can move those files out of the way by backing them up:

{{Cmd|for f in ~/.config/autostart/*.desktop ; do mv "${f}" "${f}.bak" ; done}}

=== Failure to emerge due to conflicts with x11-libs/gtk+:3 and x11-themes/mate-themes{,-meta} ===

Unfortunately, due to some packaging requirements, there is the potential for users to have an issue with proper dependency resolution when installing mate-themes{,-meta}.  Generally speaking, the simplest solution is to oneshot the appropriate mate-themes package, allowing subsequent emerges to happen without issue.  For example, if you have x11-libs/gtk+-3.18 installed, you will want to {{RootCmd|emerge -1av '{{=}}mate-themes-3.18*'}} or if you have gtk+-3.20 installed, you will want to {{RootCmd|emerge -1av '{{=}}mate-themes-3.20*'}}
