'''MATE''' (pronounced to rhyme with ''latte'', not ''late'') is a fork of the [[GNOME|GNOME 2]] desktop environment by the MATE team, which is available in the Portage tree. According to their manifesto, they aim to keep a traditional desktop look and feel, maintain an open development model, have an open relationship with GNU/Linux distributions, and serve as a good alternative for lower-end hardware.

{{Note|The MATE desktop environment has been moved to the Portage tree, with 1.6 in stable; if you have found a bug, please report it at https://bugs.gentoo.org and provide sufficient details (reproducement, info, logs, errors).}}

== Installation ==

=== Keywording ===

Note that MATE is yet to be keyworded on anything but x86 and amd64; this is tracked in {{Bug|508072}}.

=== USE flags ===

First enable and/or disable the USE flags you want for {{package|mate-base/mate}}.
{{USEflag|package=mate-base/mate
|base+yes+yes+Install base MATE Desktop applications that are recommended for the most common usage; for example, this installs the file manager. Disable this and other USE flags if you want a more minimal MATE Desktop.
|bluetooth+no+no+This USE flag is currently masked due to BlueZ / Blueman related compatibility problems.
|themes+yes+yes+Install MATE Desktop's themes; if you use other themes, you can disable this to spare some space and time.
|extras+yes+yes+Install additional MATE Desktop applications that are recommended for extended usage of the MATE Desktop as upstream sees it; for example, this installs MATE Desktop's office related applications. Disable this if you plan to use your own non-MATE Desktop alternatives or a custom mixture of MATE and non-MATE packages.
}}

=== Emerge MATE ===

Then, to install the MATE desktop environment, you can run the following command:

{{RootCmd|emerge mate-base/mate}}

As of July 2014, both MATE 1.6 and MATE 1.8 are stable on amd64; only MATE 1.8 is stable on x86.

== Usage ==

You can either use a display manager ([[SLiM]], [[GNOME/gdm|GDM]], [[LightDM]], ...) or start it manually using startx.

=== Display manager ===

To make the display manager work, you'll need to specify in the configuration of the display manager that you want to start the MATE session (mate-session); some allow you to do this interactively, for others you will need to do this in the configuration of the display manager. The default session can also often be changed by setting XSESSION="Mate" in {{Path|/etc/env.d/90xsession}}.

=== Manual start ===

To start it manually, you need to create ~/.xinitrc and make it contents as follows:

{{File|~/.xinitrc||exec mate-session}}

Note that you might need to put ck-launch-session and/or dbus-launch between exec mate-session for ConsoleKit and/or DBUS communication to work, for example:

{{File|~/.xinitrc||exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch mate-session}}

== Configuration ==
=== Compositing ===
Compositing is not be enabled by default. To enable it navigate to run {{path|System -> Preferences -> Windows}} and click the tick box alongside '''Enable software compositing window manager''' in the {{path|General}} tab.

== FAQ ==

=== Does MATE rely on a specific service manager or init system? ===

No, MATE has been tested to work with both OpenRC and systemd and might work on other service managers and init systems too (untested, but no known reason for it to break); systemd support was added in [http://mate-desktop.org/fr/blog/2013-04-02-mate-1-6-released/ release 1.6].

=== Can MATE be installed side-by-side GNOME packages or do they block? ===

As the MATE packages use their own categories, it is possible to have MATE and GNOME 3 installed at the same time which allows you to test either; taking it even a step further, if you change MATE to not have a top panel (as it gets hidden under the GNOME 3 shell) you can even start mate-session within GNOME 3 and run MATE and GNOME 3 at the same time.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== GLib-GObject-ERROR: object GsmAutostartApp 0x73ca40 finalized while still in-construction ===

When you get this error (see ~/.materc-errors), it is usually preceded by a warning, fixing the warning could fix the problem; for example, when I get to see:

{{Code||mate-session[881]: WARNING: Could not parse desktop file /home/username/.config/autostart/some-naughty-broken-program.desktop: Key file does not have key 'Name'
mate-session[881]: GLib-GObject-ERROR: object GsmAutostartApp 0x73ca40 finalized while still in-construction}}

In this case, you can resolve this by moving away the desktop file or fixing it up by adding the Name key. If you want a clean start, you can move those files out of the way by backing them up:

{{Cmd|for f in ~/.config/autostart/*.desktop ; do mv "${f}" "${f}.bak" ; done}}
