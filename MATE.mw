'''MATE''' (pronounced to rhyme with ''latte'', not ''late'') is a fork of the [[GNOME|GNOME 2]] desktop environment by the MATE team, which is available through Portage. According to their manifesto, they aim to keep a traditional desktop look and feel, maintain an open development model, have an open relationship with GNU/Linux distributions, and serve as a good alternative for lower-end hardware.

{{Note|The MATE desktop environment has been moved to the Portage tree, with 1.8 in stable; if you have found a bug, please report it at https://bugs.gentoo.org and provide sufficient details (reproducement, info, logs, errors).}}

== Installation ==

=== Keywording ===

Note that MATE is yet to be keyworded on anything but {{Keyword|x86}} and {{Keyword|amd64}}. Status of MATE keywording can be tracked in {{Bug|508072}}.

=== USE flags ===

First enable or disable desired USE flags for {{Package|mate-base/mate}}.

{{USEflag|package=mate-base/mate|desc=Optional USE flags for {{Package|mate-base/mate}}:
|base+yes+yes+Install base MATE Desktop applications that are recommended for the most common usage; for example, this installs the file manager. Disable this and other USE flags if you want a more minimal MATE Desktop.
|bluetooth+no+no+This USE flag is currently masked due to BlueZ / Blueman related compatibility problems.
|themes+yes+yes+Install MATE Desktop's themes; if you use other themes, you can disable this to spare some space and time.
|extras+yes+yes+Install additional MATE Desktop applications that are recommended for extended usage of the MATE Desktop as upstream sees it; for example, this installs MATE Desktop's office related applications. Disable this if when planning to use a non-MATE desktop alternative or a custom mixture of MATE and non-MATE packages.
}}

=== Emerge ===

To install the MATE desktop environment run the following command:

{{Emerge|params=--changed-use|mate-base/mate}}

As of July 2014, both MATE 1.6 and MATE 1.8 are stable on {{Keyword|amd64}}; only MATE 1.8 is stable on {{Keyword|x86}}.

=== Additional Packages ===

To install Caja file manager extensions run the following command:
{{Emerge| mate-extra/caja-extensions}}

Caja extensions include the following:
* {{Path|mate-extra/mate-file-manager-open-terminal}} - Open terminals in arbitrary local paths
* {{Path|mate-extra/mate-file-manager-sendto}} - Integrate email clients and Pidgin into the Caja file manager
* {{Path|mate-extra/mate-file-manager-image-converter}} - Mass resize or rotate images
* {{Path|mate-extra/mate-file-manager-share}} - Quickly share a folder from the Caja file manager

== Usage ==

Either a display manager ([[SLiM]], [[GNOME/gdm|GDM]], [[LightDM]], etc.) or the <tt>startx</tt> command can be used to start MATE during system the system boot process.

=== Display manager (DM) ===

To make the display manager work specify a MATE session (mate-session) in the configuration of the display manager; some perform this action interactively, others will need to have a configuration file modified. The default session can also often be changed by setting <code>XSESSION="Mate"</code> in {{Path|/etc/env.d/90xsession}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/env.d/90xsession|title=Enabling MATE|lang=bash|1=
XSESSION="Mate"
}}

=== Manual start ===

To start MATE manually create a {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} file in a user's home directory. Make its contents as follows:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=exec mate-session}}

Note that you might need to put ck-launch-session and/or dbus-launch between exec mate-session for ConsoleKit and/or DBUS communication to work, for example:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch mate-session}}

== Configuration ==

=== Compositing ===

Compositing is ''not'' enabled by default. To enable compositing run {{Path|System -> Preferences -> Windows}} and click the tick box alongside '''Enable software compositing window manager''' in the {{Path|General}} tab.

=== Window Centering ===

Window centering is ''not'' enabled by default. To enable window centering run {{Path| System -> Preferences -> Windows}} and click the tick box alongside '''Center new windows''' in the {{Path|Placement}} tab.

=== Window Snapping ===

Window snapping is ''not'' enabled by default. To enable window snapping run {{Path| System -> Preferences -> Windows}} and click on the tick box alongside '''Enable side by side tiling''' in the {{Path|Placement}} tab.

=== Change applications menu icon ===

The applications menu icon is set to {{Path|start-here}} by default. To use a different icon, copy your icon to a folder such as {{Path|/usr/local/share/pixmaps}} and execute the following: 
{{Cmd|$ gsettings set org.mate.panel.menubar icon-name ''icon''}} 

where ''icon'' is the name of your icon without the file extension. Restart MATE panel.

== FAQ ==

=== Does MATE rely on a specific service manager or init system? ===

No, MATE has been tested to work with both OpenRC and systemd and might work on other service managers and init systems too (untested, but no known reason for it to break); systemd support was added in [http://mate-desktop.org/fr/blog/2013-04-02-mate-1-6-released/ release 1.6].

=== Can MATE be installed side-by-side GNOME packages or do they block? ===

As the MATE packages use their own categories, it is possible to have MATE and GNOME 3 installed at the same time which allows you to test either; taking it even a step further, if you change MATE to not have a top panel (as it gets hidden under the GNOME 3 shell) you can even start mate-session within GNOME 3 and run MATE and GNOME 3 at the same time.

=== How do I enable the panel shadow? ===
Due to a race condition, the panel shadow does not appear after logging in to the MATE desktop, even with compositing enabled. You must first copy {{Path|/usr/share/applications/mate-panel.desktop}} to {{Path|~/.local/share/applications/mate-panel.desktop}}. Then set {{Path|X-MATE-Autostart-Phase}} to {{Path|Applications}}, and add a delay:

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/applications/mate-panel.desktop|lang=bash|1=
X-MATE-Autostart-Phase=Applications
X-MATE-Autostart-Delay=2
X-MATE-Provides=windowmanager
X-MATE-Autostart-Notify=true
}}
You may need to adjust the delay as needed. Finally, restart Marco with the following command:
{{Cmd| $ marco --replace}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== GLib-GObject-ERROR: object GsmAutostartApp 0x73ca40 finalized while still in-construction ===

When you get this error (see ~/.materc-errors), it is usually preceded by a warning, fixing the warning could fix the problem; for example, when I get to see:

{{CodeBox|1=mate-session[881]: WARNING: Could not parse desktop file /home/username/.config/autostart/some-naughty-broken-program.desktop: Key file does not have key 'Name'
mate-session[881]: GLib-GObject-ERROR: object GsmAutostartApp 0x73ca40 finalized while still in-construction}}

In this case, you can resolve this by moving away the desktop file or fixing it up by adding the Name key. If you want a clean start, you can move those files out of the way by backing them up:

{{Cmd|for f in ~/.config/autostart/*.desktop ; do mv "${f}" "${f}.bak" ; done}}
