'''MATE''' is a fork of GNOME 2 by The MATE team; according to their manifesto they aim to keep a traditional desktop, maintain an open development model, have an open relationship with GNU/Linux distributions and also serve as a good alternative for lower end hardware.

== Installation ==

=== Add the overlay to layman ===

First, you need to obtain layman to be able to get the MATE overlay; follow the [[Layman]] article to install it, then run the following command:

{{RootCmd|layman -a mate}}

=== Emerge MATE ===

To install MATE, you can then run the following command:

{{RootCmd|emerge mate-base/mate}}

More instructions will follow as this article gets expanded.

== Usage ==

You can either use a login manager (slim, gdm, ...) or start startx manually.

To make the login manager work, you'll need to specify in the configuration of the login manager that you want to start the MATE session (mate-session); some allow you to do this interactively, for others you will need to do this in the configuration of the login manager. The default session can also often be changed by setting XSESSION="Mate" in {{Path|/etc/env.d/90xsession}}.

To start it manually, you need to create ~/.xinitrc and make it contents as follows:

{{File|~/.xinitrc||exec mate-session}}

== FAQ ==

=== Does MATE rely on a specific service manager or init system? ===

No, MATE has been tested to work with both OpenRC and systemd and might work on other service managers and init systems too (untested, but no known reason for it to break); systemd support was added in [http://mate-desktop.org/fr/blog/2013-04-02-mate-1-6-released/ release 1.6].

=== Can MATE be installed side-by-side GNOME packages or do they block? ===

As the MATE packages use their own categories, it is possible to have MATE and GNOME 3 installed at the same time which allows you to test either; taking it even a step further, if you change MATE to not have a top panel (as it gets hidden under the GNOME 3 shell) you can even start mate-session within GNOME 3 and run MATE and GNOME 3 at the same time.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== GLib-GObject-ERROR: object GsmAutostartApp 0x73ca40 finalized while still in-construction ===

When you get this error (see ~/.materc-errors), it is usually preceded by a warning, fixing the warning could fix the problem; for example, when I get to see:

{{Code||mate-session[881]: WARNING: Could not parse desktop file /home/tomwij/.config/autostart/gnome-sound-applet.desktop: Key file does not have key 'Name'
mate-session[881]: GLib-GObject-ERROR: object GsmAutostartApp 0x73ca40 finalized while still in-construction}}

In this case, you can resolve this by moving away the desktop file or fixing it up by adding the Name key. If you want a clean start, you can do:

{{Cmd|for f in ~/.config/autostart/*.desktop ; do mv "${f}" "${f}.bak" ; done}}
