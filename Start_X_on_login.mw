This guide shows how you can start X after logging in to terminal. Its lightweight alternative to display managers.

Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.bash_profile|lang=bash|1=
[[ $(tty) = "/dev/tty1" ]] && exec startx
}}

Now when you log in to the first terminal bash executes startx automatically.

You can combine this with [[Automatic_login_to_virtual_console]] to automatically startx on startup.
