This guide shows how you can start X after logging in to terminal. Its lightweight alternative to display managers. When combined with [[Automatic_login_to_virtual_console]] a system can be configured to automatically boot directly into X.

=== X ===
To automatically start X, add the following to your ~/.bash_profile.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.bash_profile|lang=bash|1=
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && [[ $(tty) = /dev/tty1 ]]; then exec startx; fi
}}

=== KDE ===
To automatically start KDE, add the following to your ~/.bash_profile.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.bash_profile|lang=bash|1=
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && [[ $(tty) = /dev/tty1 ]]; then exec startx /usr/bin/startkde; fi
}}

Now when you log in to the first terminal bash executes startx automatically.
