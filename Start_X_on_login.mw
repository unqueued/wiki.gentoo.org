This guide shows how you can start X after logging in to terminal. Its lightweight alternative to display managers.

Add the following to your ~/.bash_login.
{{FileBox|filename=~/.bash_login|lang=bash|1=
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && [[ $(tty) = /dev/tty1 ]]; then exec startx; fi
}}

Now when you log in to the first terminal bash executes startx automatically.

You can combine this with [[Automatic_login_to_virtual_console]] to automatically startx on startup.
