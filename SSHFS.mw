'''sshfs''' ('''SSH''' '''F'''ile '''S'''ystem) is [[Article description::a secure shell client used to mount remote filesystems to local machines.]] SSHFS uses [[Filesystem in Userspace]] ([[FUSE]]) to mount filesystems in a location users can easily access.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Since SSHFS uses [[FUSE]] it will need to be enabled in the kernel.
{{KernelBox|title=Enabling FUSE in the kernel|1=
File systems  --->
   [*] FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support
}}

{{Note|When enabling a built-in (non-modular) feature or driver in the kernel remember a recompile will be needed and the new kernel loaded into memory (system reboot) before changes will take effect. This step should be completed ''before'' moving on to other sections in this article.}}

=== USE flags ===

There are currently no available USE flags for SSHFS.

=== Emerge ===

Use the {{c|emerge}} command to ask Portage to install {{Package|net-fs/sshfs}}:

{{Emerge|net-fs/sshfs}}

== Usage ==

In order to use SSHFS a [[SSH|SSH daemon]] needs to be running on the remote machine.

To mount a remote file system locally the right privileges will be needed. When attempting to mount a remote directory without adding a user name to the command the current active user name will be used by default. For example, if the user Larry is currently the active user on the system and this command is ran:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|sshfs remotehost:/usr/portage/ /mnt/portage}}

The command will most likely fail because ''larry's'' user name will be sent to the remote system. The previous command is the equivalent of running this command:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|sshfs larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/system /path/to/local/sshfs/mount}}

To change the user, put the name of the user before the IP address to domain name. For example, to login to the remote system using the remote system's ''root'' user name and password, use:

{{Cmd|sshfs root@remotehost:/path/to/remote/system /path/to/local/sshfs/mount}}

=== Mounting ===

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|sshfs larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/sshfs/mountpoint}}

=== Unmounting ===

To unmount a directory with SSHFS use the {{c|fusermount}} command with the <code>-u</code> option:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|fusermount -u /path/to/local/sshfs/mount}}

=== Permissions based options ===

In order to have read/write access to a mounted remote directory you may need to use the allow_other and/or allow_root options depending on if you are a regular user or root.  Simply enable as shown below (replace allow_other with allow_root, if root).

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|sshfs -o allow_other larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/sshfs/mountpoint}}

Alternatively, the uid, gid, and umask options can be used to further fine tune permissions. When setting multiple options at the same time use a space separated list after a single <kbd>-o</kbd>.

{{CodeBox|title=umask, uid, gid options|1=
-o umask=M
    set file permissions (octal)

-o uid=N
    set file owner

-o gid=N
    set file group}}

=== Automating the connection ===

For remote file systems that need to be mounted frequently, it is wise to automate the sign in process. Automation can be achieved by an public/private SSH key pair combined with special instructions to mount the remote filesystem on a specific event (user login, or system boot for example).

The first step is to setup the SSH key pair on the local and remote machines. Visit the [[SSH#Passwordless_Authentication|Passwordless Authentication section of the SSH article]] for further instructions on how set up an SSH key pair. When finished return to this article.

After the key pair has been created and properly set up, determine what event will be used to start the connection automatically. It is common for a system to attempt to remotely mount a file system upon user login or system boot. Controlling the {{c|sshfs}} mount depends on what software the user will be implementing in their local environment. There are several ways to handle the task.

==== fstab ====

{{c|sshfs}} can be used inside a system's {{Path|[[fstab|fstab]]}} file. This enables over-the-network filesystems to be assigned to act as local filesystem mounts. Filesystems using sshfs require slightly different mount options, so be sure to look at the man page to be sure the options are correct in each use case. A example of using sshfs in fstab:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|title=Adding sshfs to fstab|lang=bash|1=
# Automatically mount ~/Music on connection
sshfs#SERVER_USER@remotehost:/SOURCEDIR /home/USER/Music fuse user,_netdev,idmap=user,transform_symlinks,identityfile=/home/USER/.ssh/id_rsa,allow_other,default_permissions,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
}}

==== Login shells ====

Most shells include support for commands to be executed during user login or logout. This section will provide examples on how to automate the connection using built in shell script.

Before proceeding, it is necessary to know which shell is being used. Execute the following command as the user of interest to determine which shell is being used:

{{Cmd|echo $SHELL}}

Possible output:

* {{Path|/bin/bash}} for {{c|bash}}
* {{Path|/bin/sh}} for {{c|sh}}
* {{Path|/bin/tcsh}} for {{c|tcsh}} ({{c|csh}})
* {{Path|/bin/zsh}} for {{c|zsh}}

{{Note|For more information on available shells see the [[Shell|Shell article]].}}

===== Bash =====

When using a bash shell, create a {{Path|~/.bash_login}} and {{Path|~/.bash_logout}} files in the user's home directory and add the sshfs command to the file.

{{Cmd|touch ~/.bash_login ~/.bash_logout}}

Mount on shell login:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.bash_login|title=Adding sshfs mount to bash login shell|lang=bash|1=
# Added to mount a remote directory at user login
sshfs larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/sshfs/mountpoint
}}

Unmounting on shell logout:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.bash_logout|title=Adding sshfs unmount to bash logout shell|lang=bash|1=
# Added to unmount a remote directory at user logout
fusermount -u /path/to/local/sshfs/mountpoint
}}

===== Sh =====

{{Cmd|touch ~/.profile}}

{{FileBox|filename=~/.profile|title=Adding sshfs mount to sh login shell|lang=bash|1=
# Added to mount a remote directory at user login
sshfs larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/sshfs/mountpoint
}}

===== Zsh =====

{{Cmd|touch ~/.zlogin}}

{{FileBox|filename=~/.zlogin|title=Adding sshfs mount to zsh login shell|lang=bash|1=
# Added to mount a remote directory at user login
sshfs larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/sshfs/mountpoint
}}

===== Tcsh (Csh) =====

{{Cmd|touch ~/.login}}

{{FileBox|filename=~/.login|title=Adding sshfs mount to tcsh or csh login shell|lang=bash|1=
# Added to mount a remote directory at user login
sshfs larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/sshfs/mountpoint
}}

=== Desktop environments ===

Most desktop environments include methods for automatically starting programs.

==== GNOME ====

==== KDE ====

==== OpenBox ====

OpenBox uses the {{Path|autostart}} file located in each user's home directory.

{{FileBox|filename=~/.config/openbox/autostart|title=Adding sshfs mount OpenBox autostart file|lang=bash|1=
# Added to mount a remote directory at user login
sshfs larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/sshfs/mountpoint &
}}

{{Note|It is important to include the <code>&</code> (ampersand) on the end of commands issued inside OpenBox's autostart file.}}
