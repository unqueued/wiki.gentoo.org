SSHFS ('''SSH''' '''F'''ile '''S'''ystem) is a secure shell client used to mount remote filesystems to local machines. SSHFS uses fuse to mount filesystems in userspace.

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Since SSHFS uses FUSE it will need to be enabled in the kernel.
{{KernelBox|title=Enabling FUSE in the kernel|1=
File systems  --->
    [*] FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support
}}

{{Note|When enabling a built-in (non-modular) feature or driver in the kernel remember a recompile will be needed and the new kernel loaded into memory (system reboot) before changes will take effect. This step should be completed ''before'' moving on to other sections in this article.}}

=== USE flags ===

There are currently no available USE flags for SSHFS.

=== Emerge ===

Use the <tt>emerge</tt> command to ask Portage to install {{Package|sys-fs/sshfs-fuse}}:

{{Emerge|sys-fs/sshfs-fuse}}

== Usage ==

In order to use SSHFS a [[SSH|SSH daemon]] needs to be running on the remote machine.

To mount a remote file system locally the right privileges will be needed. When attempting to mount a remote directory without adding a user name to the command the current active user name will be used by default. For example, if the user Larry is currently the active user on the system and this command is ran:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|sshfs remotehost:/usr/portage/ /mnt/portage}}

The command will most likely fail because <code>larry</code>'s user name will be sent to the remote system. The previous command is the equivalent of running this command:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|sshfs larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/system /path/to/local/sshfs/mount}}

To change the user, put the name of the user before the IP address to domain name. For example, to log in to the remote system using the remote system's <code>root</code> user name and password, use:

{{Cmd|sshfs root@remotehost:/path/to/remote/system /path/to/local/sshfs/mount}}

=== Mounting ===

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|sshfs larry@remotehost:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/sshfs/mountpoint}}

=== Unmounting ===

To unmount a directory with SSHFS use the <tt>fusermount</tt> command with the <code>-u</code> option:

{{Cmd|prompt=larry@example $|fusermount -u /path/to/local/sshfs/mount}}

=== Automating the connection ===

For file system that need to be mounted frequently it is wise to automate the sign in process. Automation can be achieved with a public/private SSH key pair.
