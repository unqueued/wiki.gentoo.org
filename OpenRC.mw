'''OpenRC''' is a dependency based init system that works with the system provided init program, normally /sbin/init. It is not a replacement for /sbin/init. OpenRC is 100% compatible with [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]] init scripts, which means you can probably find one for the daemons you want to start in the Gentoo Portage Tree. OpenRC, however, is not exclusively used by Gentoo Linux and can be used on different Linux and BSD systems.

== Features ==
'''OpenRC''' provides a number of features touted as innovative by recent init system like [[systemd]] or [[upstart]] like hardware initiated initscript run or [[cgroups]] support without requiring large layout changes to accomodate the radically different design and dependencies required by [[systemd]].

*todo* tabular comparison with systemd and upstart.

The tabular comparison appears to be biased negatively against sysvinit and upstart. It is copied from the systemd website.

== Size and complexity ==

OpenRC (0.9.3): sysvinit + 300 files, ~30k lines, 3.3k posix sh, ~12k C

Upstart (1.5): 285 files, ~185k lines, ~97k C

Debian: sysvinit + 120 files, 5.8k lines

SystemD (v44+): dbus + glib + 900 files, 224k lines, 125k C 

sysvinit: 560kB, 75 files, ~15k lines 

DBus: 11MB, ~500 files. 300k lines, 120k C

glib: 72MB, ~2500 files, ~1.7M lines, ~430k C


Debian startup is smallest, it's only shell with sysvinit (C) as dependency

Upstart is about 10 times bigger in terms of lines of code/text. Most of the extra complexity size comes from C.

OpenRC is about twice as big as debian startup. The size difference is mostly the OpenRC core written in C, which expands the footprint from ~3k LoC to ~15k LoC compared to shell.

SystemD is about 10 times bigger, like upstart. But with the mandatory deps it blows up to about one hundred times the code footprint!
Most of the extra code is in mandatory dependencies, but the systemd core is also bigger than anything else.

== OpenRC Busybox Integration ==

Busybox can be used replace most of the userspace needed by OpenRC (init, shell, awk and other posix tools), by using a complete busybox as shell for openrc all the calls that normally would cause a fork/exec would be spared, improving the overall speed. The process isn't yet streamlined.

=== Replacing init ===

The sysvinit inittab provided by Gentoo is not compatible to the busybox init.

{{File|/etc/inittab|Example inittab compatible with busybox init|<pre>
::sysinit:/sbin/rc sysinit
::wait:/sbin/rc boot
::wait:/sbin/rc
</pre>}}

In order to set a specific runlevel from the bootloader the variable `softlevel=` should be used.

=== busybox specific init.d files ===

TODO: busybox provides a number of applets that could be used to replace third party software like acpid or dhcp/dhcpcd.

=== Replacing udev with mdev ===

See [[Mdev]]




[[Category:Core system]]

== Advanced Usage ==

* Named runlevels
* Stacked runlevels
* select specific runlevel at boot

* stateful init scripts and automatic respawning (run "rc")
