'''OpenRC''' is [[Article description::a dependency-based init system that maintains compatibility with the system provided {{c|init}} program]], normally located in {{Path|/sbin/init}}. It does not function as a replacement for the {{Path|/sbin/init}} file. OpenRC is 100% compatible with Gentoo init scripts, which means a solution can be found to run the dozens of daemons in the main Gentoo repository. OpenRC, however, is not designed to be exclusively used by Gentoo Linux and can be used on other distributions and BSD systems.

== Features ==

OpenRC provides a number of features touted as innovative by recent init systems like [[systemd]] or upstart, such as hardware initiated initscripts run or [[cgroups]] support. It does this without requiring large layout changes to accommodate radically different designs and dependencies.

{{Tip|See the [[comparison of init systems]] article for more information on init systems.}}

=== OpenRC Busybox integration ===

Busybox can be used to replace most of the userspace utilities needed by OpenRC ({{c|init}}, shell, {{c|awk}} and other POSIX tools), by using a complete Busybox as shell for OpenRC all the calls that normally would cause a fork/exec would be spared, improving the overall speed. This process is not yet streamlined.

Please note that there are currently many Busybox applets that are incompatible with OpenRC. See {{Bug|529086}} for details.

=== Replacing init ===

In order to set a specific runlevel from the bootloader the variable <code>softlevel=</code> should be used.

==== busybox ====

The SysV-init {{Path|/etc/inittab}} file provided by Gentoo is not compatible with the Busybox {{Path|init}}.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/inittab|title=Example inittab compatible with Busybox init|1=
::sysinit:/sbin/openrc sysinit
::wait:/sbin/openrc boot
::wait:/sbin/openrc
}}

==== openrc-init ====

Beginning with OpenRC 0.25, a new program is provided on Linux, {{c|openrc-init}}, which can replace {{Path|/sbin/init}} on startup.

{{c|openrc-init}} will ignore the {{Path|/etc/inittab}} file and boot OpenRC directly.

This also means that terminals will need to be activated via the {{Path|/etc/init.d/agetty}} service as they will not spawn automatically. For example, activating tty1:

{{RootCmd
|ln -sr /etc/init.d/agetty /etc/init.d/agetty.tty1
|rc-update add agetty.tty1 default
}}

Adding <code>init=/sbin/openrc-init</code> to the boot parameters will start this system.

{{Warning|The standard sysvinit tools, i.e. {{c|shutdown}} and {{c|reboot}}, will not function while openrc-init is running.  Instead the {{c|openrc-shutdown}} command must be used to shutdown the system.}}

=== Busybox specific init.d files ===

TODO: busybox provides a number of applets that could be used to replace third party software like acpid or dhcp/dhcpcd.

=== Replacing udev with mdev ===

See [[mdev]].

=== Replacing udev with eudev ===

Older Gentoo installs were using [[udev]] as the main {{package|virtual/udev}} provider.  Based on {{bug|575718}} it was changed to [[eudev]]. However, the rc service is still {{path|/etc/init.d/udev}}.  

== Configuration ==

=== Files ===

; {{Path|/etc/rc.conf}}
: The global OpenRC configuration file.

=== Network management ===

OpenRC can be used with one of several network managers or even with none, see [[Network management]] and [[Network management/OpenRC message|OpenRC message]].

=== Dependency behavior ===

Changing the default dependencies of init scripts, might be needed to fit more complex setups. See {{Path|/etc/rc.conf}} for how to change the default behavior; notice the ''rc_depend_strict'' option. In addition, next networking examples show how flexible OpenRC can be.

; ''Multiple network interfaces (example)''
The [[SSH|SSH service]] must come up with the internal network, for instance ''eth0'' and never ''wlan0''.

Overrule the "net" dependency from {{Path|/etc/init.d/sshd}}, and refine it to depend on "net.eth0":

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/sshd|lang=bash|1=
rc_need="!net net.eth0"
}}

; ''Multiple network interfaces in multiple runlevels (example)''
The SSH service must start with ''eth0'' (not ''wlan0'') in "default" runlevel, but in "office" runlevel it must start with ''wlan0'' (not ''eth0'').

Keep the default:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/rc.conf|lang=bash|1=
#rc_depend_strict="YES"
}}

Make additional symlinks to {{c|sshd}} with the network interface names:

{{RootCmd
|ln -s sshd /etc/init.d/sshd.eth0
|ln -s sshd /etc/init.d/sshd.wlan0
}}

Settings are read from {{Path|/etc/conf.d/sshd.eth0}} and {{Path|/etc/conf.d/sshd.wlan0}} now:

{{RootCmd
|cp /etc/conf.d/sshd /etc/conf.d/sshd.eth0
|cp /etc/conf.d/sshd /etc/conf.d/sshd.wlan0
}}

Add the dependencies:

{{RootCmd
|echo <nowiki>'rc_need="!net net.eth0"'</nowiki> >> /etc/conf.d/sshd.eth0
|echo <nowiki>'rc_need="!net net.wlan0"'</nowiki> >> /etc/conf.d/sshd.wlan0
}}

In this example ''net.eth0'' and ''net.wlan0'' read their settings from {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net}}, or {{Path|/etc/conf.d/net.office}} depending on the active runlevel. Add all runscripts to the different runlevels:

{{RootCmd
|rc-update add sshd.eth0 default
|rc-update add sshd.wlan0 office
|rc-update add net.eth0 default office
|rc-update add net.wlan0 default office
}}

To switch between "default" runlevel and "office" runlevel without rebooting the computer, change to "nonetwork" runlevel in between. The network interfaces will be stopped this way, and re-read their runlevel specific configuration. This works best when "nonetwork" is a ''stacked runlevel'' in both the "default" and "office" runlevels, and the display manager and other non-network services are added to the "nonetwork" runlevel only.

'''<pre>default runlevel <---> nonetwork runlevel <---> office runlevel</pre>'''

{{RootCmd
|rc nonetwork && rc office
|rc nonetwork && rc default
}}

=== Selecting a specific runlevel at boot ===

OpenRC reads the kernel command-line used at boot time, and will start the runlevel specified by the "softlevel" parameter if provided, instead of 'default'.

For instance, you can choose whether to boot into the 'default' or 'nonetwork' runlevels with the following example {{Path|grub.conf}} configuration:

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/grub/grub.conf|title=Example grub.conf (GRUB Legacy)|1=

title=Regular Start-up

kernel (hd0,0)/boot/kernel-3.7.10-gentoo-r1 root=/dev/sda3

title=Start without Networking

kernel (hd0,0)/boot/kernel-3.7.10-gentoo-r1 root=/dev/sda3 softlevel=nonetwork
}}

== Usage ==

=== Runlevels ===

OpenRC can be controlled and configured using {{c|openrc}}, {{c|rc-update}} and {{c|rc-status}} commands.

'''Delete from default runlevel'''

{{RootCmd
|rc-update delete dropbox default #replace dropbox with program to remove
}}

=== Listing ===

Use {{c|rc-update show -v}} to display all available init scripts and their their current runlevel (if they have been added to one):

{{RootCmd|rc-update show -v}}

Running {{c|rc-update}} or {{c|rc-update show}} will display only the init scripts that have been added to a runlevel.

==== Named runlevels ====

OpenRC runlevels are directories living in {{Path|/etc/runlevels}} to create additional runlevels is enough to issue:

{{RootCmd|install -d /etc/runlevels/$runlevel}}

==== Stacked runlevels ====

Is possible manage variants using {{c|rc-update -s}}.

An usage example for using stacked runlevel on laptop to group networking services based on location is at [[OpenRC/StackedRunlevel]].

=== Prefix ===

[[Project:Prefix|Gentoo Prefix]] installs Gentoo within an offset, known as a prefix, allowing users to install Gentoo in another location in the filesystem hierarchy, hence avoiding conflicts. Next to this offset, Gentoo Prefix runs unprivileged, meaning no root user or rights are required to use it.

By using an offset (the "prefix" location), it is possible for many "alternative" user groups to benefit from a large part of the packages in the Gentoo Linux Portage tree. Currently users of the following systems successfully run Gentoo Prefix: Mac OS X on PPC and x86, Linux on x86, x86_64 and ia64, Solaris 10 on Sparc, Sparc/64, x86 and x86_64, FreeBSD on x86, AIX on PPC, Interix on x86, Windows on x86 (with the help of Interix), HP-UX on PARISC and ia64. 

OpenRC runscript already support prefix-installed daemons, during the Summer of Code 2012 work will be done to implement full secondary/session daemon behavior to complete the overall feature set provided by Prefix.

[[OpenRC/Prefix]], a tutorial for trying it out.

=== Hotplug ===

OpenRC can be triggered by external events, such as new hardware from udev. See [[OpenRC/Event Driven]] for details.

=== Automatic respawning crashed services ===

OpenRC can return state of services to runlevel setting state, to provide stateful init scripts and automatic respawning. What you need is to run {{c|openrc}} (for default runlevel). Crashed services start and manual run services will stop. To prevent this you can run {{c|openrc -n}} (<code>--not-stop</code>)

By default {{c|openrc}} will attempt just to start crashed services, not restart. This сontrolled by rc_crashed_stop (default NO) and rc_crashed_start (default YES) options in {{Path|/etc/rc.conf}}.

=== CGroups support ===

OpenRC starting with version 0.12 has extended cgroups support. See [[OpenRC/CGroups]] for details.

=== Chroot support ===

{{RootCmd
|mkdir /lib64/rc/init.d
|ln -s /lib64/rc/init.d /run/openrc
|touch /run/openrc/softlevel
|emerge --oneshot sys-apps/openrc
}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/rc.conf|title=OpenRC config file|lang=bash|1=
rc_sys="prefix"
rc_controller_cgroups="NO"
rc_depend_strict="NO"
rc_need="!net !dev !udev-mount !sysfs !checkfs !fsck !netmount !logger !clock !modules"
}}
