'''OpenRC''' is a dependency based init system that works with the system provided init program, normally /sbin/init. It is not a replacement for /sbin/init. OpenRC is 100% compatible with [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]] init scripts, which means you can probably find one for the daemons you want to start in the Gentoo Portage Tree. OpenRC, however, is not exclusively used by Gentoo Linux and can be used on different Linux and BSD systems.

== Features ==
'''OpenRC''' provides a number of features touted as innovative by recent init system like [[systemd]] or [[upstart]] like hardware initiated initscript run or [[cgroups]] support without requiring large layout changes to accomodate the radically different design and dependencies required by [[systemd]].

*todo* tabular comparison with systemd and upstart.

== OpenRC Busybox Integration ==

Busybox can be used replace most of the userspace needed by OpenRC (init, shell, awk and other posix tools).

*todo* detail how.

=== Replacing udev with mdev ===

See [Mdev]

== Advanced Usage ==

* Named runlevels
* Stacked runlevels
* select specific runlevel at boot
