'''UNetbootin''' ('''U'''niversal '''Netboot''' '''In'''staller) is an easy to use [[LiveUSB]] flash key rescue disk generator.

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|sys-boot/unetbootin}}:
{{Emerge|unetbootin}}

== Usage ==
There are two options to use ISOs in UNetbootin.  The distribution option will use UNetbootin to automatically download a disk image for the distribution of choice.  The diskimage option is used when the user already has a disk image that they would like to use.
==== Using the Distribution Option ====
#Select the Distribution option at the top. 
#Use the drop down menus to pick the distribution and the version.  
#Use the menu at the bottom to select the type of drive that will be used.
#Select the drive to be used when flashing the disk image. 
#Click OK when ready.

==== Using the Diskimage Option ====
#Select the Diskimage option on the bottom.
#Select either ISO or Floppy depending on the type of bootable image being used.  
#Use the file browser to select the bootable image to be used.  
#If needed, select the amount of space needed to preserve files across reboots using the buttons provided.  
#Use the menu at the bottom to select the type of device that will be used.
#Select drive to be used when flashing the disk image.
#Click OK when ready.

=== Windows 7 live USB ===

Making windows 7 bootable usb install media requires several things to happen in a special order.  This requires unetbootin 494 binaries from sourceforge.  It is a good idea to also have official portage unetbootin installed to satisfy all of the binary dependencies.

#Install [[gparted]] and [[ntfs]]-3g.
#Format your 8GB or larger medium as NTFS.
#Mount the freshly formatted USB disk.
#Get the unetbootin-linux-494 binary from source forge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/unetbootin/files/UNetbootin/494/
#Run {{RootCmd|chmod a+x unetbootin-linux-494}}
#Run {{RootCmd|./unetbootin-linux-494}}
#Select diskimage, then locate the windows ISO using the file browser.  Select "show all" in the file browser, then navigate to your USB device's NTFS partition.
#Select OK, and go have a cup of hot coco as this will take some time.  Exit instead of rebooting.  Then unmount and remove the flash drive.

== Troubleshooting ==
=== UNetbootin Appearing Blank When Opened ===
Sometimes UNetbootin will appear as a blank window when opened. If this happens, it is a problem with the script that runs the executable.  This can be fixed by running: {{RootCmd|QT_X11_NO_MITSHM{{=}}1 /usr/bin/unetbootin.elf}} This can be run either as root or with sudo.
