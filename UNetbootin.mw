=== Windows 7 live USB ===

Making windows 7 bootable usb install media requires several things to happen in a special order.  This requires unetbootin 494 binaries from sourceforge.  It is a good idea to also have official portage unetbootin installed to satisfy all of the binary dependencies.

* install [[gparted]] and [[ntfs]]-3g.

* format your 8gb or larger media as NTFS.

* mount freshly formatted USB disk

* get unetbootin-linux-494 binary from source forge http://sourceforge.net/projects/unetbootin/files/UNetbootin/494/

* chmod +x unetbootin-linux-494

* as root run ./unetbootin-linux-494

* select disk image, then locate windows ISO.  Select show all drives, then navigate to your USB devices NTFS partition.

* select OK, have a cup of hot coco as this will take some time.  Exit rather than reboot.  Unmount, and remove flash drive.

== Troubleshooting ==
=== UNetbootin Appearing Blank When Opened ===
Sometimes UNetbootin will appear as a blank window when opened. If this happens, it is a problem with the script that runs the executable.  This can be fixed by running: {{RootCmd|QT_X11_NO_MITSHM{{=}}1 /usr/bin/unetbootin.elf}} This can be run either as root or with sudo.
