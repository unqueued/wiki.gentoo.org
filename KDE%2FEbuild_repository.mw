The [[Project:KDE|Gentoo KDE team]] maintains the ''[http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/kde.git;a=summary kde]'' [[overlay]]. It contains KDE SC versions in preparation to be moved to the portage tree, pre versions of the next main version and live versions for master and latest branch.

== Prerequisites ==

=== Overlay ===
Installing snapshots and live ebuilds are only available through ''kde'' overlay, so first thing is to install it:
{{RootCmd|layman -f -a kde}}

For more information regarding overlays, please read the [[overlay]] article.

== Installing KDE SC snapshots ==
During testing phases KDE upstream provides snapshots taken from the git source repositories. Beta and Release Candidate KDE releases are following the snapshot model below (where x is the version number of the ''previous'' release, i.e. 11 for KDE SC 4.12 Beta):

{| class="wikitable"
! style="background: #31206C; color: white; white-space: nowrap;" | KDE SC version
! style="background: #31206C; color: white; white-space: nowrap;" | Ebuilds version
|-
|Beta 1
|4.x.80
|-
|Beta 2
|4.x.90
|-
|Release Candidate 1
|4.x.95
|-
|Release Candidate 2
|4.x.97
|}

== Installing KDE SC live ebuilds ==
KDE SC is Open Source, with its code being available for browsing through [http://quickgit.kde.org/ KDE QuickGit], and for public checkout. Gentoo, as a source based distro, has the ability to provide live ebuilds that checkout the code either from the latest branch or from master. Currently, we provide 4.12.49.9999 ebuilds from 4.12 branch and 9999 ebuilds from git master.

{| class="wikitable"
! style="background: #31206C; color: white; white-space: nowrap;" | KDE SC version
! style="background: #31206C; color: white; white-space: nowrap;" | Ebuilds version
|-
|KDE SC 4.12 branch
|4.12.49.9999
|-
|KDE SC 4 master
|9999
|}

=== Unmasking ===
Users with stable systems have to keyword the packages to proceed. We provide a {{Path|package.keywords}} file in ''kde'' overlay, which we'll have to symlink to our {{Path|package.keywords}} directory:

* KDE SC 4.12 branch:
: {{RootCmd|cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|
  |ln -s /path/to/overlay/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-4.12.49.9999.keywords}}

* KDE SC master:
: {{RootCmd|cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|
  |ln -s /path/to/overlay/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-live.keywords}}

=== Installation ===
In addition to the standard [[KDE#Packages|packages]], installation can be done by using sets:

* Installation of KDE SC 4.12 branch:
: {{Emerge|@kde-4.12}}

* Installation of KDE SC master:
: {{Emerge|@kde-live}}
