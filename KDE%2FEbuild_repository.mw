The [[Project:KDE|Gentoo KDE team]] maintains the [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/kde.git;a=summary kde overlay]. This overlay covers ebuilds for KDE SC 4, KDE Frameworks, Plasma, KDE Applications and a lot more. It contains versions in preparation to be moved to the portage tree, preliminary versions like betas or release candidates and live versions for version-controlled stable branches as well as latest development trees.

== KDE overlay ==

The KDE overlay is registered as one of the [[layman]]-supported overlays, making it available for immediate use. All that is needed is to enable the KDE overlay on the system:

{{RootCmd|layman -f -a kde}}
