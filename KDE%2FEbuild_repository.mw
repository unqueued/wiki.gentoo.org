The [[Project:KDE|Gentoo KDE team]] maintains the [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/kde.git/ kde overlay]. This overlay covers ebuilds for KDE SC 4, KDE Frameworks 5, Plasma 5, KDE Applications 5, and a lot more. It contains versions in preparation to be moved to the main tree, preliminary versions like betas or release candidates, and live versions for version-controlled stable branches as well as latest development trees.

== KDE overlay ==

The KDE overlay is registered as one of the [[layman]]-supported overlays, making it available for immediate use. All that is needed is to enable the KDE overlay on the system:

{{RootCmd|layman -f -a kde}}

{{/KDE SC 4}}

== Using Frameworks 5 ==

{{/Frameworks 5}}
