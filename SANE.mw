[http://www.sane-project.org/ SANE - Scanner Access Now Easy] enables the use of scanners on Linux. It provides drivers for many different scanners, a daemon to manage access to all scanners attached to the system, and a command-line frontend application {{c|scanimage}} which implements basic scanning functionality.

== Installation ==

=== Backend ===

SANE backends (a.k.a. drivers) are provided by the {{Package|media-gfx/sane-backends}} package.

The SANE project maintains a [http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html searchable list of supported (and some unsupported) devices]. Find your scanner on that list, and note the values provided for '''Backend''' and (if it's a USB scanner) '''USB id''', which will be needed for configuration.

In {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}, set <var>SANE_BACKENDS</var> to a space-separated list of the backends that need to be installed, as obtained from the list on the SANE project website.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
SANE_BACKENDS="epson2"
}}

To see all supported backends, run:
{{Cmd|emerge -pv sane-backends|output=
<pre>[ebuild   R   ] media-gfx/sane-backends-1.0.25-r1  USE="ipv6 nls threads usb -doc -gphoto2 -snmp -systemd -v4l -xinetd -zeroconf" ABI_X86="(64) -32 (-x32)" SANE_BACKENDS="abaton agfafocus apple artec artec_eplus48u as6e avision bh canon canon630u canon_dr cardscan coolscan coolscan2 coolscan3 dc210 dc240 dc25 dell1600n_net dmc epjitsu epson epson2 fujitsu genesys gt68xx hp hp3500 hp3900 hp4200 hp5400 hp5590 hpljm1005 hs2p ibm kodak kodakaio kvs1025 kvs20xx leo lexmark ma1509 magicolor matsushita microtek microtek2 mustek mustek_usb nec net niash p5 pie pixma plustek plustek_pp qcam ricoh rts8891 s9036 sceptre sharp sm3600 sm3840 snapscan sp15c st400 stv680 tamarack teco1 teco2 teco3 {test} u12 umax umax1220u umax_pp xerox_mfp -canon_pp -hpsj5s -kvs40xx -mustek_pp -mustek_usb2 -pnm"</pre>}}
or look [http://www.sane-project.org/sane-backends.html on the SANE project's website].

Ensure that the proper <var>USE</var> flags are set to support your scanner's features, e.g. if it is a USB scanner, set the <code>usb</code> flag.
{{USEflag|package=media-gfx/sane-backends}}
It may also be necessary to change the kernel configuration to allow it to detect the scanner, e.g. for a USB scanner, USB support needs to be enabled in the kernel.

There is usually no need to explicitly install the backend package since it will be pulled in as a dependency of the frontend, but those who would like to do so anyway can run:
{{RootCmd|emerge -a media-gfx/sane-backends}}

=== Frontend ===

The {{Package|media-gfx/sane-backends}} package provides one frontend application, {{c|scanimage}}. Most users will want to install another one. The SANE project maintains [http://www.sane-project.org/sane-frontends.html a list of frontends], many of which are available in Portage.

XSane is a capable default option. To install XSane or any frontend, check their <var>USE</var> flags. For example:
{{USEflag|package=media-gfx/xsane}}

Install the package:
{{RootCmd|emerge -a media-gfx/xsane}}

== Configuration ==

Installing SANE creates the {{c|scanner}} group. Any user account that is to access the scanner needs to get added to this group.
{{RootCmd|usermod -aG scanner <username>}}
After changing the group membership, the affected user(s) will need to log out and into the system again.
{{Note|Users of {{c|systemd}} might not need to add users to the {{c|scanner}} group. See [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SANE#Permission_problem ArchWiki] for more.}}

In many cases, SANE simply works without any further configuration needed. To test this, ensure that the scanner is connected and powered on, and run
{{Cmd|scanimage -L|output=<pre>device `epson2:libusb:001:009' is a Epson CX3800 flatbed scanner</pre>}}
If the scanner is identified, as in the example above, everything is fine.

=== Troubleshooting ===

If {{c|scanimage -L}} is unable to identify the scanner, it will look like this:
{{Cmd|scanimage -L|output=<pre>No scanners were identified. If you were expecting something different,
check that the scanner is plugged in, turned on and detected by the
sane-find-scanner tool (if appropriate). Please read the documentation
which came with this software (README, FAQ, manpages).</pre>}}
In most cases, the first step to take in resolving this issue is to run <code>sane-find-scanner</code> as root.
{{RootCmd|sane-find-scanner|output=<pre>
  # sane-find-scanner will now attempt to detect your scanner. If the
  # result is different from what you expected, first make sure your
  # scanner is powered up and properly connected to your computer.

  # No SCSI scanners found. If you expected something different, make sure that
  # you have loaded a kernel SCSI driver for your SCSI adapter.

could not fetch string descriptor: Pipe error
found USB scanner (vendor=0x04b8 [EPSON], product=0x0818 [USB MFP]) at libusb:001:008
could not fetch string descriptor: Pipe error
could not fetch string descriptor: Pipe error

  # Your USB scanner was (probably) detected. It may or may not be supported by
  # SANE. Try scanimage -L and read the backend's manpage.

  # Not checking for parallel port scanners.

  # Most Scanners connected to the parallel port or other proprietary ports
  # can't be detected by this program.</pre>}}
If the output does not contain a line saying that the scanner was detected, it probably will not work with SANE.

Assuming {{c|sane-find-scanner}} ''does'' find the scanner, as in the example above, there are a few things to check. First, try running {{c|sane-find-scanner}} as a non-root user. If it fails to detect the scanner when run this way, that means the problem is most likely permissions on the device node. The man page for the device type will have more information on how to handle this. For USB scanners:
{{Cmd|man sane-usb}}
For SCSI scanners:
{{Cmd|man sane-scsi}}

Make sure that the correct device was identified, e.g. in the example above, check that the USB vendor and product numbers listed in the output match the '''USB id''' obtained from the SANE website. If not, it means that SANE is detecting something other than the scanner.

If the correct device is detected, it may be necessary to edit the configuration file for the corresponding SANE backend. These configuration files are located in {{Path|/etc/sane.d/}}. Each backend that gets installed has an associated configuration file with the same name, for example {{Path|/etc/sane.d/epson2.conf}}. The man page for the backend will have more information on what edits may be necessary, for example
{{Cmd|man sane-epson2}}

== Scanning over the network ==

SANE includes a daemon, <code>saned</code>, which allows other computers to use attached scanners over the network. To enable this feature, some configuration has to be done on both the server and client.

=== Server settings ===
There are two possible ways to configure your SANE server. The saned approach is the simplest of the two.
==== saned ====
Update {{Path|/etc/sane.d/saned.conf}} to include the IP address or subnet of the clients that will be accessing this scanner server.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sane.d/saned.conf|
192.168.0.0/24
}}
Add saned to your default runlevel and start it.
{{RootCmd|rc-update add saned default}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/saned start}}

==== xinetd ====
The scanner daemon is called {{c|saned}}, by default, it listens to port 6566.

When using [[xinetd]] instead of starting the server directly, remember to enable saned by setting {{c|disable}} to {{c|No}} and allow your network to access the daemon ({{c|only_from = 192.168.0.0/24}}):
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/xinetd.d/saned|lang=apache|
1=service sane-port
{
  socket_type = stream
  server = /usr/sbin/saned
  protocol = tcp
  user = saned
  group = scanner
  only_from = 192.168.0.0/24  # Added
  wait = no
  disable = no                # Changed
}
}}

If you want to access the server locally, also add {{c|localhost}} to the allowed clients.

Don't forget to (re)start {{c|xinetd}}:
{{RootCmd|systemctl restart xinetd.service}}

=== Client settings ===

Add the server to {{Path|/etc/sane.d/net.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sane.d/net.conf|lang=ini|1=## saned hosts
the_sane_server
}} 

Test with {{cmd|scanimage -L}} if the server can be found now.
