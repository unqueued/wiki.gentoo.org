=SANE=
SANE provides the Linux scanner library, driver and daemon.

To list all available scanners, use
{{Cmd|scanimage -L|output=<pre>device `plustek:libusb:009:002' is a Canon CanoScan LiDE25 flatbed scanner</pre>}}

The relevant config files are in {{path|/etc/sane.d/}}.

== Scanning over the network ==

If you want to enable scanning over the network, some configurations have to be adapted both on the server and on the client side.

=== Server settings ===

The scanner daemon is called {{c|saned}}, by default, it listens to port 6566.

When using [[xinetd]] instead of starting the server directly, remember to enable saned by setting {{c|disable}} to {{c|No}} and allow your network to access the daemon ({{c|only_from = 192.168.0.0/24}}):
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/xinetd.d/saned|lang=apache|
1=service sane-port
{
  socket_type = stream
  server = /usr/sbin/saned
  protocol = tcp
  user = saned
  group = scanner
  only_from = 192.168.0.0/24  # Added
  wait = no
  disable = no                # Changed
}
}}

If you want to access the server locally, also add {{c|localhost}} to the allowed clients.

Don't forget to (re)start {{c|xinetd}}:
{{RootCmd|systemctl restart xinetd.service}}

=== Client settings ===
Add the server to {{Path|/etc/sane.d/net.conf}}:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/sane.d/net.conf|lang=ini|1=## saned hosts
the_sane_server
}} 

Test with {{cmd|scanimage -L}} if the server can be found now.
