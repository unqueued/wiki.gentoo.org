<!--T:1-->
This article describes the manual configuration and setup of the [[Kernel|Linux kernel]]. For an automatic method see the [[genkernel]] article.

== Set symlink == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
The symlink <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> should always point to the kernel sources that is currently being used. This can be done in one of three ways:

<!--T:4-->
; 1. Installing the kernel sources with active ''symlink'' [[USE flag]]
: This will make the <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> point to your newly installed kernel sources. If necessary, it can still be modified later with the following two methods:
; 2. Setting the symlink with '''eselect''':
: {{RootCmd| eselect kernel list |
  |output=Available kernel symlink targets:<br/> &nbsp; [1] linux-2.6.39-gentoo-r2 *<br/> &nbsp; [2] linux-2.6.39-gentoo-r3
}}
: This outputs the available kernel sources. The asterisk indicates the chosen sources. To change the kernel sources, e.g. to the second entry, do:
: {{RootCmd|eselect kernel set 2}}

<!--T:5-->
; 3. Setting the symlink manually:
: {{RootCmd|ln -sf /usr/src/linux-2.6.39-gentoo-r3 /usr/src/linux |
  |ls -l /usr/src/linux |
  |output=lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 Aug 29 22:10 /usr/src/linux -> linux-2.6.39-gentoo-r3}}

== Configuration tools == <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
The kernel offers several tools to configure himself:

<!--T:8-->
; '''make config'''
: Text based configuration. The options are prompted one after another. All options need to be answered, and out-of-order access to former options is not possible.

<!--T:9-->
; '''make menuconfig'''
: Graphical menu (only text input). You can navigate through the menu and change the options you want.

<!--T:10-->
; '''make nconfig'''
: Graphical menu based on ncurses. Requires {{Package|sys-libs/ncurses}} to be installed.

<!--T:11-->
; '''make xconfig'''
: Graphical menu using Qt4. Requires {{Package|x11-libs/qt-gui}} to be installed.

<!--T:12-->
; '''make gconfig'''
: Graphical menu using GTK+. Requires {{Package|x11-libs/gtk+}}, {{Package|dev-libs/glib}} and {{Package|gnome-base/libglade}} to be installed.

<!--T:13-->
There are also several scripts to create miscellaneous default configurations. See:
{{RootCmd|make help}}

== Configuration == <!--T:14-->

<!--T:15-->
This article describes the configuration using '''make menuconfig''', but the procedure is similar for the other menus.
{{RootCmd|cd /usr/src/linux
|make menuconfig}}

=== Usage === <!--T:16-->

<!--T:17-->
In the shown menu the blue bar indicates your position. With the arrow keys {{Key|up}} and {{Key|down}} you can change the position. The arrow keys {{Key|left}} and {{Key|right}} traverse the menu bar in the bottom and define, what happens, when you hit the {{Key|Enter}} key. '''Select''' switches to a sub menu - the menu entries ending with ''--->'' - , while '''Exit''' exits a sub menu. Alternative you can hit the {{Key|Esc}} key twice.

<!--T:18-->
Menu entries, which start with brackets, are drivers or features which can be activated:

<!--T:19-->
; [ ], [*]
: Options in square brackets can be activated or deactivated. The asterisk marks the menu entry as activated. You change the value with the {{Key|space}} key or press {{Key|Y}} ('''Y'''es) to activate or {{Key|N}} ('''N'''o) to deactivate the entry.
: Is the option is activated, the chosen driver will be built into the kernel and will always be available at boot time.

<!--T:20-->
; < >, <M>, <*>
: Options in angle brackets can be activated or deactivated, but also activated as module (indicated by a ''M''). You change the value as before and press key {{Key|M}} for activate as module.
: The differentiation between a driver as module and a driver build into the kernel is, that the module is not loaded at boot time, so speeds up the boot. As needed you are loading the module yourself or let a tool like [[udev]] do it (as needed also at boot time). Simpler in the usability is a driver build into the kernel.

<!--T:21-->
; {M}, {*}
: Options in curly brackets can be activated or activated as module but not be deactivated, because another driver needs this activated in either way.

<!--T:22-->
; -M-, -*-
: Options between hyphens are activated in the shown way by another driver. There is no choice.


<!--T:23-->
Furthermore some menu entries have a tag at the end:

<!--T:24-->
; (NEW)
: This driver is new in the kernel and is maybe not stable enough.

<!--T:25-->
; (EXPERIMENTAL)
: This driver is experimental and most likely not stable enough.

<!--T:26-->
; (DEPRECATED)
: This driver is deprecated and not needed for most systems.

<!--T:27-->
; (OBSOLETE)
: This driver is obsolete and should not be activated.


<!--T:28-->
Most options have a description, which get by pressing the {{Key|H}} key or choose in the menu bar '''Help'''.

=== Driver selection === <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->
See the [[hardware detection]] article and the articles in the [[:Category:Hardware|Hardware]] category.

=== Search modules === <!--T:45-->
Within ''menuconfig'', you can use {{Key|/}} to search modules by keyboards.

== Build == <!--T:31-->

<!--T:32-->
After configuring the kernel you have to compile the kernel:
{{RootCmd|make}}

<!--T:33-->
If you have a processor with multiple cores, you can let all the cores do the work. For this add the parameter '''-j(NUMBER_CORES +1)'''. For a dual core processor:
{{RootCmd|make -j3}}

== Setup == <!--T:34-->

<!--T:35-->
If activated drivers as modules, you have to install them:
{{RootCmd|make modules_install}}
The modules will be copied to a sub folder of <tt>/lib/modules</tt>.

<!--T:46-->
To install the actual kernel:
{{RootCmd|make install}}

<!--T:47-->
This command executes <tt>/sbin/installkernel</tt>, which is part of the {{Package|sys-apps/debianutils}} package. It copies the kernel and the additional files in Debian's naming syntax to <tt>/boot</tt> and creates there the symlinks <tt>vmlinuz</tt>, <tt>System.map</tt> and <tt>config</tt>, which point to the new kernel etc. The symlinks pointing to the older kernel sources will be renamed to <tt>.old</tt> suffix, as well as the old kernel if it has the same version as newly-installed one. These symlinks are handy, because they point always to the newest kernel without changing the file path (e.g. you can use them in the bootloader configuration).

== Bootloader == <!--T:39-->

<!--T:40-->
Change your bootloader configuration to pick up at boot the new kernel.

<!--T:41-->
Finally restart your system with the new kernel.
