{{Metadata|abstract=This article describes the manual configuration and setup of the Linux kernel. For an authomatic method, see the genkernel article.}}

<!--T:1-->
This article describes the manual configuration and setup of the [[Kernel|Linux kernel]]. For an automatic method see the [[genkernel]] article.

== Set symlink == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
The symlink {{Path|/usr/src/linux}} should always point to the kernel sources that is currently being used. This can be done in one of three ways:

<!--T:4-->
; 1. Install the kernel sources with the <code>symlink</code> [[USE flag]] active.
: This will make the {{Path|/usr/src/linux}} point to the newly installed kernel sources. If necessary, it can still be modified later with the following two methods:

<!--T:48-->
; 2. Setting the symlink with the <kbd>eselect</kbd> tool:

</translate>
: {{RootCmd| eselect kernel list |
  |output=Available kernel symlink targets:<br/> &nbsp; [1] linux-3.3.8-gentoo *<br/> &nbsp; [2] linux-3.4.9-gentoo
}}
<translate>

<!--T:49-->
: This outputs the available kernel sources. The asterisk indicates the chosen sources. To change the kernel sources, e.g. to the second entry, do:

</translate>
: {{RootCmd|eselect kernel set 2}}
<translate>

<!--T:5-->
; 3. Setting the symlink manually:

</translate>
: {{RootCmd|ln -sf /usr/src/linux-3.4.9-gentoo /usr/src/linux |
  |ls -l /usr/src/linux |
  |output=lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 Aug 29 22:10 /usr/src/linux -> /usr/src/linux-3.4.9-gentoo}}
<!-- The output is the same as the target file in the ln command. -->
<translate>

== Configuration tools == <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
The kernel offers several tools to configure itself:

<!--T:8-->
; <kbd>make config</kbd>
: Text based configuration. The options are prompted one after another. All options need to be answered, and out-of-order access to former options is not possible.

<!--T:9-->
; <kbd>make menuconfig</kbd>
: Graphical menu (only text input). Navigate through the menu to modify the desired options.

<!--T:10-->
; <kbd>make nconfig</kbd>
: Graphical menu based on ncurses. Requires {{Package|sys-libs/ncurses}} to be installed.

<!--T:11-->
; <kbd>make xconfig</kbd>
: Graphical menu using Qt4. Requires {{Package|dev-qt/qtgui}} to be installed.

<!--T:12-->
; <kbd>make gconfig</kbd>
: Graphical menu using GTK+. Requires {{Package|x11-libs/gtk+}}, {{Package|dev-libs/glib}} and {{Package|gnome-base/libglade}} to be installed.

<!--T:13-->
; <kbd>make oldconfig</kbd>
: Review changes between kernel versions and update to create new {{Path|.config}} for kernel.


<!--T:51-->
There are also several scripts to create miscellaneous default configurations. See:

</translate>
{{RootCmd|make help}}
<translate>

== Configuration == <!--T:14-->

<!--T:15-->
This article describes the configuration using the <kbd>make menuconfig</kbd> tool, but the procedure is similar for the other menus.

</translate>
{{RootCmd|cd /usr/src/linux
|make menuconfig}}
<translate>

=== Usage === <!--T:16-->

<!--T:17-->
In the shown menu the blue bar indicates the position of the cursor. With the {{Key|↑}} and {{Key|↓}} arrow keys change the position of the cursor. The {{Key|←}} and {{Key|→}}  arrow keys traverse the menu bar in the bottom and define what happens when the {{Key|Enter}} key is pressed. For the menu bar below, '''Select''' switches to a sub menu for the menu entries ending with <tt>---></tt> while '''Exit''' exits a sub menu. As an alternative the {{Key|Esc}} key can be pressed twice to exit the application.

<!--T:18-->
Menu entries, which start with brackets, are drivers or features that can be activated:

<!--T:19-->
; [ ], [*]
: Options in square brackets can be activated or deactivated. The asterisk marks the menu entry as activated. The value can be changed with the {{Key|space}} key. It is also possible to press {{Key|Y}} key ('''Y'''es) to activate or {{Key|N}} key ('''N'''o) to deactivate the selected entry.
: If the option is activated, the selected feature/driver will be built into the kernel and will always be available at boot time.

<!--T:20-->
; < >, <M>, <*>
: Options in angle brackets can be activated or deactivated, but also activated as module (indicated by a ''M''). The values can be modified by pressing {{Key|Y}}/{{Key|N}} keys as before or by pressing the {{Key|M}} key to activate the feature/driver as a module.
: See the [[Kernel Modules]] article for differentiation.

<!--T:21-->
; {M}, {*}
: Options in curly brackets can be activated or activated as module but not be deactivated. This happens because another driver is dependent on this feature.

<!--T:22-->
; -M-, -*-
: Options between hyphens are activated in the shown way by another driver. There is no choice.


<!--T:23-->
Furthermore some menu entries have a tag at the end:

<!--T:24-->
; '''(NEW)'''
: This driver is new in the kernel and is maybe not stable enough.

<!--T:25-->
; '''(EXPERIMENTAL)'''
: This driver is experimental and most likely not stable enough.

<!--T:26-->
; '''(DEPRECATED)'''
: This driver is deprecated and not needed for most systems.

<!--T:27-->
; '''(OBSOLETE''')
: This driver is obsolete and should not be activated.


<!--T:28-->
Most options have a description, which see by pressing the {{Key|H}} key or choosing '''Help''' in the menu bar.

=== Driver selection === <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->
See the [[hardware detection]] article and the articles in the [[:Category:Hardware|Hardware]] category.

=== Search modules === <!--T:45-->
Within <tt>menuconfig</tt>, use the {{Key|/}} key to search modules by name.

As shown below, the search result will show numbers in front of the matches. Pressing {{Key|1}} in the example below would make <tt>menuconfig</tt> jump straight to the option ''Bluetooth device drivers'' in the menu structure.

{{KernelBox|
Symbol: BT_HCIBTUSB [{{=}}m]                       
Type  : tristate                               
Prompt: HCI USB driver                         
  Location:                                    
    -> Networking support (NET [{{=}}y])           
      -> Bluetooth subsystem support (BT [{{=}}y]) 
(1)     -> Bluetooth device drivers            
  Defined at drivers/bluetooth/Kconfig:5       
  Depends on: NET [{{=}}y] && BT [{{=}}y] && USB [{{=}}m]
}}

=== Enabling Gentoo Linux common settings === <!--T:52-->

<!--T:53-->
There is a kernel configuration option called <code>CONFIG_GENTOO_LINUX</code> only present in {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} and other [[Project:Kernel|Kernel Project]] maintained kernels. It does nothing on its own, but sets various required configuration options for typical installations.

<!--T:54-->
This setting automatically selects <code>tmpfs</code> and <code>devtmpfs</code> support, which are needed for handling {{Path|/dev}} on Gentoo Linux, but might be expanded in the future to enable other mandatory settings for a Gentoo Linux system. For more information, read the help information available through the kernel configuration system as described earlier in this guide.

== Build == <!--T:31-->

<!--T:32-->
After configuration has been accomplished successfully, compile the kernel:

</translate>
{{RootCmd|make}}
<translate>

<!--T:33-->
For processors with multiple cores, make all the cores do the work: add the option <tt>-j(NUMBER_CORES +1)</tt>. For example, a dual core processor contains two cores plus one (2+1):

</translate>
{{RootCmd|make -j3}}
<translate>

== Setup == <!--T:34-->

<!--T:35-->
If drivers are activated as modules, they must be installed:

</translate>
{{RootCmd|make modules_install}}
<translate>

<!--T:50-->
The modules will be copied to a sub directory of {{Path|/lib/modules}}.

<!--T:46-->
To install the actual kernel:

</translate>
{{RootCmd|make install}}
<translate>

<!--T:47-->
This command executes <kbd>/sbin/installkernel</kbd>, which is part of the {{Package|sys-apps/debianutils}} package. ''The new kernel is installed into {{Path|/boot/vmlinuz-{version}}}. If a symbolic link {{Path|/boot/vmlinuz}} already exists, it is refreshed by making a link from {{Path|/boot/vmlinuz}} to the new kernel, and the previously installed kernel is available as {{Path|/boot/vmlinuz.old}}.'' (''installkernel'' [[man page]]). The same for {{Path|config}} and {{Path|System.map}} files. These symlinks are handy, because they always point to the newest kernel without changing the file path (e.g. they can be used in the bootloader configuration).

== Bootloader == <!--T:39-->

<!--T:40-->
Change the system's [[bootloader]] configuration to pick up at boot the new kernel.

<!--T:41-->
Finally restart the system with the new kernel.

<!--T:44-->
