== Big Picture Mode and games not working with controller ==

This issue is most likely caused by incorrect uinput device node permissions.

=== Sony DualShock 3 ===

Check {{Path|/dev/uinput}}:

<pre>
crw-rw---- 1 root input 10, 223 Apr  3 21:44 /dev/uinput
</pre>

In order for Big Picture Mode to see the controller, it needs the user to have write access to it. The solution is a udev rule:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/udev/rules.d/60-dualshock3.rules|lang=bash|1=
# Fix permissions to allow the DualShock 3 controller to be used by Steam
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="054c", MODE="0666"
KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"
}}

After saving the file, udev will need to be "re-triggered":

{{RootCmd|udevadm control --reload|udevadm trigger}}

If the user(s) that intend to use the controller with Steam are not already in the {{c|input}} group, they will need to be added:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a <user> input}}

After that, log out and back in as said user. Steam should detect the controller without issue. A good way to test this is to make sure Steam has focus and press the {{Key|PlayStation}} button. If Big Picture mode starts, the controller is detected and configured correctly.

=== Microsoft Xbox 360 controller ===

== Direct rendering is not being used ==

If Steam starts with the following error:

<pre>
Error: OpenGL GLX context is not using direct rendering, which may cause performance problems.
</pre>

Confirm if direct rendering is enabled with {{c|glxinfo}}, which is provided by the {{Package|x11-apps/mesa-progs}} package:

{{RootCmd|glxinfo {{!}} grep "direct rendering"|output=<pre>
direct rendering: Yes
</pre>
}}

If direct rendering is not enabled, ensure that the correct OpenGL implementation is [[eselect|selected]]:

{{RootCmd|eselect opengl list}}

Next, ensure that the user running Steam has sufficient permissions to access direct rendering. If the <var>USE</var> variable is set to <code>acl</code> and [[ConsoleKit]] or [[systemd]] is being used, permissions will be handled automatically. Otherwise, add the user running Steam to the {{c|video}} group:

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a ''user'' video}}

If direct rendering is enabled and the correct OpenGL implementation is selected, then this issue may be caused by {{Package|app-eselect/eselect-opengl}} 1.3*.<ref>Michał Górny. [https://github.com/anyc/steam-overlay/issues/121 steam-launcher likely broken with eselect-opengl-1.3*], [https://github.com/anyc/steam-overlay anyc's Steam Overlay], January 2nd, 2015. Retrieved on May 27th, 2015.</ref>. This issue has been fixed for users of the {{c|steam-launcher}} ebuild. Otherwise, run the following as a temporary workaround:

For ATI drivers:

{{Cmd|LD_LIBRARY_PATH{{=}}"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib32/opengl/ati/lib" steam}}

For Nvidia drivers:

{{Cmd|LD_LIBRARY_PATH{{=}}"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib32/opengl/nvidia/lib" steam}}

If direct rendering is ''still'' not enabled, refer to the Steam Knowledge Base [https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9938-EYZB-7457 article] on direct rendering for possible solutions.

== Hardened Gentoo ==

It seems that the Steam binary has <code>rwx</code> bits set, and needs to be PaX marked in order to work on a hardened system:

{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam}}

The binaries of most games should also be PaX marked:

{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/World\ of\ Goo/WorldOfGoo}}
{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Uplink/uplink.bin.x86_64}}
{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team\ Fortress\ 2/hl2_linux}}

Failure to perform PaX marking will result in the game failing to run, with little information given. To check if a game needs to be PaX marked, run the game's startup script or binary file (found in {{Path|~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps}} or {{Path|~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common}}) under a debugger. This can be accomplished with some of Valve's provided startup scripts by setting the <var>GAME_DEBUGGER</var> environment variable to <code>gdb</code>:

{{Cmd|env GAME_DEBUGGER{{=}}gdb ./hl2.sh}}

If a binary needs to be PaX marked, {{c|gdb}} should output something similar to:

<pre>warning: Cannot call inferior functions, Linux kernel PaX protection forbids return to non-executable pages!</pre>

and/or:

<pre>Cannot access memory at address 0x80486c6.</pre>

After an update in July 2013, Steam also needs a PaX marked {{Path|/bin/bash}} when the OpenGL libraries require <code>rwx</code> markings, otherwise games will fail to run from the Steam client<ref>Alex Efros. [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/254 Compatibility with PaX/GrSecurity], [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux Steam for Linux], December 22nd, 2012. Retrieved on May 28th, 2015.</ref>:

{{Cmd|sudo paxctl-ng -m /bin/bash}}

However, this results in Bash failing to run. It is also a security issue, and it is strongly recommended to try without PaX marking. If it works when using the proprietary Nvidia drivers, please make a note of it on this page.

== libGL fails to load driver ==

The Steam runtime overrides various system libraries, including libgcc, libstdc++, and libgpg-error with its own bundled versions<ref>jsa1983. [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime/issues/13 Problem with libstdc++.so.6 bundled with steam-runtime 2014-04-15], [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux Steam for Linux], April 26th, 2014. Retrieved on December 26th, 2015.</ref>. This can result in Steam failing to start with the following error:

<pre>
libGL error: unable to load driver: <driver_name>.so
</pre>

To workaround this issue, locate the problematic library by starting Steam with libGL debugging enabled:

{{Cmd|LIBGL_DEBUG{{=}}verbose /usr/bin/steam|output=<pre>
libGL: dlopen /usr/lib32/dri/i965_dri.so failed (/usr/lib32/libgcrypt.so.20: symbol gpgrt_lock_lock, version GPG_ERROR_1.0 not defined in file libgpg-error.so.0 with link time reference)
libGL error: unable to load driver: i965_dri.so
</pre>}}

Next, delete the problematic library from the Steam runtime to force the use of system library instead:

{{Cmd|find ~/.steam/root/ -name "libgpg-error.so*" -print}}

Repeat the above to discover other problematic libraries in the Steam runtime. The bundled libraries may reappear after every Steam update. In this case simply delete the libraries again from the Steam runtime.

If the above solution does not work, run the following as a temporary workaround:

For Nvidia drivers: 

{{Cmd|LD_LIBRARY_PATH{{=}}"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib32/opengl/nvidia/lib" steam}}

=== libGL fails to load driver with AMDGPU ===

When using [[AMDGPU]], Steam may fail to start with the following error:

<pre>
libGL error: unable to load driver: radeonsi_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: radeonsi
libGL error: unable to load driver: radeonsi_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: radeonsi
libGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
</pre>

To workaround this issue, disable the problematic libraries from the Steam runtime to force the use of system libraries instead<ref>itsnikolay. [https://askubuntu.com/questions/614422/problem-with-installing-steam-on-ubuntu-15-04/616988#616988 Problem with installing Steam on Ubuntu 15.04+], [https://askubuntu.com/ Ask Ubuntu], May 1st, 2015. Retrieved on September 19th, 2018.</ref>:

{{Cmd

|mv ~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/i386/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6{,.disable}
}}

{{Note|Tested with a Sapphire Radeon HD 7870 GPU on {{Keyword|~amd64}} and <code>VIDEO_CARDS{{=}}"amdgpu radeonsi"</code> in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.}}

== Memory corruption ==

If Steam starts with the following error:

<pre>
*** glibc detected *** zenity: malloc(): memory corruption: 0x00000000016cf020 ***
</pre>

Installing the {{Package|x11-libs/libXi}} package should fix the issue.

{{Emerge|x11-libs/libXi}}

== Missing fonts ==

If Steam is having issues with missing [[Fontconfig|fonts]], installing the {{Package|media-fonts/font-bitstream-100dpi}} and {{Package|media-fonts/corefonts}} packages may fix the issue.

{{Emerge|media-fonts/font-bitstream-100dpi media-fonts/corefonts}}

If the X server does not recognize the newly installed fonts, run the following:

{{Cmd
|xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/100dpi
|xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/corefonts
|xset fp rehash
}}

== Reset the installation ==

To reset (i.e. wipe) the Steam installation, including installed games, and reinstall Steam without losing data:

{{Cmd|steam --reset}}

== Reversed X cursor ==

If an X cursor theme has not been set by the desktop environment or window manager, Steam will override the default X cursor theme. This can result in a reversed X cursor from left to right. The issue can be fixed by setting an X cursor theme, if one is available, or by installing an X cursor theme:

{{Emerge|x11-themes/vanilla-dmz-xcursors}}

If the X cursor is still reversed, even after exiting Steam, run the following to fix the issue:

{{Cmd|xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr}}

== Segfault when remember my password is selected ==

Selecting the <code>Remember my password</code> option at the Steam login dialog when Steam is running without D-Bus, will cause Steam to segfault the next time it is started<ref>Shished. [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3415 Steam segfaults when "remember my password" is checked], [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux Steam for Linux], July 28th, 2014. Retrieved on May 25th, 2015.</ref>. This issue can be fixed by running the following:

{{Cmd|rm -fr ~/.local/share/Steam/config}}

== Segfault when starting Steam ==

If Steam fails to start with the following error:

<pre>
munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer: 0xf75aca24
free(): invalid pointer: 0xffca16d0
</pre>

Setting the locale to <code>C</code> may fix the issue<ref>pnrao. [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/4887 Steam client not launching], [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux Steam for Linux], March 6th, 2017. Retrieved on June 11th, 2017.</ref>:

{{Cmd|LANG{{=}}C steam}}

== Segfault when using apulse ==

Using Steam with {{Package|media-sound/apulse}} while D-Bus is ''not'' running, will cause Steam to segfault with a <code>Connection refused</code> message. This issue can be fixed by ensuring that D-Bus is running:

{{RootCmd|rc-service dbus start}}

== Taskbar button persists even when closed or minimized  ==

Depending on the desktop environment being used, the Steam taskbar button may persist even when the Steam window is closed or minimized to the system tray<ref>Kevin Cox. [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/1025 Close to Tray], [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux Steam for Linux], January 30th, 2013. Retrieved on May 27th, 2015.</ref>. To correct this behavior, force the Steam window to close instead of minimize:

{{Cmd|STEAM_FRAME_FORCE_CLOSE{{=}}1 steam}}

To set the <var>STEAM_FRAME_FORCE_CLOSE</var> [[Handbook:Parts/Working/EnvVar|environment variable]] permanently, add the following to the [[shell]] login initialization file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.bash_profile|title=Setting a local environment variable with Bash|1=
export STEAM_FRAME_FORCE_CLOSE=1
}}

Log out and back in to have the changes take effect.

== Steam hangs when installing a game ==

If clicking the Install button on a Steam game page causes the Steam client to hang with the following console output:

<pre>
GameAction [AppID 255710, ActionID 1] : LaunchApp failed with AppError_18 with ""              
GameAction [AppID 255710, ActionID 1] : LaunchApp changed task to Failed with ""
</pre>

It might be possible to fix this by running Steam with:

{{Cmd|STEAM_RUNTIME{{=}}1 STEAM_RUNTIME_PREFER_HOST_LIBRARIES{{=}}1 steam}}

== Use system libraries ==

Steam bundles many libraries which are used instead of the system libraries. To force Steam to use the system libraries, disable the Steam runtime:

{{Warning|It is '''''not''''' recommended to disable the Steam runtime, as it can lead to numerous problems, including runtime and missing 32-bit libraries.}}

{{Cmd|STEAM_RUNTIME{{=}}0 steam}}

To set the <var>STEAM_RUNTIME</var> [[Handbook:Parts/Working/EnvVar|environment variable]] permanently, add the following to the [[shell]] login initialization file:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.bash_profile|title=Setting a local environment variable with Bash|1=
export STEAM_RUNTIME=0
}}

Log out and back in to have the changes take effect.

== Video drivers ==

* If ATI Legacy drivers are used, and a Valve game (Counter-Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2, etc.) fails to start with the following error:

<pre>
Required OpenGL extension "GL_EXT_texture_sRGB_decode" is not supported. Please update your OpenGL driver.
</pre>

Update the ATI Legacy drivers to the most recent version<ref>Mark Browning. [http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/846938351012409765 &#91;WORKAROUND&#93; Allow TF2 to run with legacy ATI drivers 12.6.], [http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410 Steam for Linux Steam Community], December 4th, 2012. Retrieved on May 30th, 2015.</ref>.

== xterm launches briefly and then closes ==

This issue is caused by the shell being set to something other than a POSIX compliant shell (i.e. fish). Change the shell to a POSIX compliant shell and accept the Steam license agreement. The shell can be set back afterwards.

== VERSION_ID: unbound variable ==
