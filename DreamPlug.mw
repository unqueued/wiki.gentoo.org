I recently obtained a DreamPlug and installed Gentoo on it, '''roughly''' following [http://dev.gentoo.org/~armin76/arm/sheevaplug/install.xml armin76's (un)official howto]

I plan to write a full howto below.

== Kernel ==

As of today (24 March 2012) the vanilla kernel (and therefore gentoo-sources) does not yet support in full DreamPlug, so you have to use a custom kernel image, like the ones available on [http://www.plugcomputer.org/plugforum/index.php?board=2.0 PlugComputer Forums].

The good news is that this is planned and actively being worked on.
