The '''Trinity Desktop Environment''' ('''TDE''') is a free and open-source desktop environment forked from [[KDE]] 3.5. Due to the fact it is forked from an old version of KDE (which is itself a resource-heavy desktop environment) it is considered light-medium weight by today's standards. 

== Preparation ==
=== repos.conf ===

Create a file in the {{Path|[[:/etc/portage/repos.conf|/etc/portage/repos.conf]]}} directory (create the {{Path|repos.conf}} directory first if it does not exist) called {{Path|trinity.conf}}. Fill the file's contents with the following code:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/repos.conf/trinity.conf|lang=ini|1=
[trinity]
location = /usr/local/overlay/trinity
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/Fat-Zer/trinity.git
auto-sync = yes
masters = gentoo
}}

=== USE flags ===
The qt3 USE flag must be unmasked in order to install Trinity. To do this, run:

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /etc/portage/profile|echo -qt3 >> /etc/portage/profile/use.mask|mkdir -p /etc/portage/packages.keywords/|cp /var/lib/layman/trinity /etc/portage/packages.keywords/}}
