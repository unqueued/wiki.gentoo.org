'''i3''' is [[Article description::a minimalist [[window manager]], focusing on keyboard commands to manipulate windows.]] By default all windows are in full-screen in order to best maximize the use of the screen and have less fiddling with positioning. Even with the <code>doc</code> USE flag enabled its installed size is less than 1.6 MB. It also uses less than 10 MB of RAM under normal operating conditions.
