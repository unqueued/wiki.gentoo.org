The Linux firmware package contains [[wikipedia:binary blobs|binary blobs]] of firmware necessary for partial or full functionality of certain hardware devices on Linux systems. These binary blobs are usually proprietary necessary because certain hardware manufacturers do not release source code necessary to build the firmware itself.

Modern graphics card from AMD and NVidia almost certainly require binary blobs to be loaded for the hardware to operate correctly.

Although integrated graphics on Intel CPUs do not need binary blobs, Intel Wi-Fi devices almost always do require blobs to be loaded.

== Installation ==

For security reasons, hotloading firmware into a running kernel has been shunned upon. Modern init systems such as [[systemd]] have strongly discouraged loading firmware from userspace.

=== Kernel ===

A few kernel options are important to consider when building in firmware support for certain devices in the Linux kernel:

; <var>CONFIG_FW_LOADER</var>: This option is provided for the case where none of the in-tree modules
; <var>CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL</var>: Enabling this option will build each required firmware blob specified by <var>EXTRA_FIRMWARE</var> into the kernel directly, where the <code>request_firmware()</code> function will find them without having to make a call out to userspace.
; <var>CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE</var>: This option is a string and takes the (space-separated) names of firmware files to be built into the Kernel. These files will then be accessible to the kernel at runtime.

{{Warning Including firmware files into binary kernel images that are not available under the terms of the GPL, may result in a violation of the GPL if the image is distributed. It is wise to consult a lawyer ''before'' distributing images that contain firmware files from {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}.}}

=== Searching for loaded firmware ===

dmesg can be grepped to determine what firmware has been loaded:

{{Cmd|dmesg {{!}} grep -i firmware}}
