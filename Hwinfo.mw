Hardware Information Tool (hwinfo) is a small utility created by OpenSUSE to gather information on system hardware. 

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== Emerge ===

<tt>hwinfo</tt> can be installed with a simple <tt>emerge</tt>:

{{Emerge|{{Package|sys-apps/hwinfo}}}}

== Configuration ==

Since the tool is so lightweight configuration is not necessary.

== Usage ==

To probe for hardware information simply issue:

{{RootCmd|hwinfo}}

To probe for all hardware information use:

{{RootCmd|hwinfo +all}}

This usually takes longer, but provides oodles of information.

To shorten information to a more human-friendly format, add the <code>--short</code> option to the command:

{{RootCmd|hwinfo --short all}}

To specify a log file for hwinfo to write, use <code>log=</code>. This is different from standard redirection, but should be used for <tt>hwinfo</tt>:

{{RootCmd|hwinfo log{{=}}hardware.txt all}}
