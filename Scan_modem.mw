{{Stub}}

{{c|scanModem}} finds a suitable driver for a connected modem. {{c|scanModem}} is not in the Portage tree, so it has to be manually downloaded and extracted:

{{Cmd
|wget http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/scanModem.gz
|gunzip scanModem.gz
|chmod +x scanModem
|./scanModem}}

It will create a folder {{Path|Modem}} and the file {{Path|scanout.something}} contains the wanted information. If a modem is detected, the driver is named next to ''Drivers'', e.g. for a HSF modem:

{{FileBox|filename=./Modem/scanout.something|1=
Driver=hsfmodem-drivers
}}
