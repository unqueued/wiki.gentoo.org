DXVK is a [[Vulkan]]-based translation layer for [[Wikipedia:Direct3D|Direct3D]] 10/11 which allows running 3D applications on Linux using [[Wine]].

== Requirements ==

'''Pre-built versionː'''

* [[Wine]] 3.10 or newer
* [[Winetricks]] - Live build
* [[Vulkan]]

'''If compiled from a sourceː'''

* [[Wine]] 3.10 or newer
* Meson build system (at least version 0.43)
* MinGW64 compiler and headers (requires threading support)
* glslang compile

== Installation ==

DXVK can be installed from a pre-built release or by building from source. Whichever method is chosen, installing for Wine or [[Wikipedia:Lutris|Lutris]] is the same.

=== Pre-built release ===

Fetch and extract a DXVK release:

{{Cmd
|wget <nowiki>https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/download/v<version>/dxvk-<version>.tar.gz</nowiki>
|tar -xvf dxvk-<version>.tar.gz
|cd ~/dxvk-<version>
}}

{{Note|Replace <var><version></var> with the DXVK version being used e.g. 0.72}}

=== Building from source ===

Install the required dependencies:

{{Emerge
|{{=}}app-emulation/winetricks-9999 app-emulation/wine-vanilla dev-util/glslang dev-util/meson dev-vcs/git
|params+=--noreplace
}}

DXVK also requires [https://mingw-w64.org/ Mingw-w64]. Please refer to the [[Mingw]] article for installation instructions.

Clone the DXVK [[Git]] repository:

{{Cmd|git clone <nowiki>https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk.git</nowiki> ~/dxvk}}

Build and install DXVK:

{{Cmd
|cd ~/dxvk
|./package-release.sh master ~/dxvk-release --no-package
|cd ~/dxvk-release/dxvk-master 
}}

This will create the directory {{Path|~/dxvk-release/dxvk-master}} which contains both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of DXVK.

=== Installing for Wine ===

Install DXVK into <var>WINEPREFIX</var> which by default is set to {{Path|~/.wine}}:

{{Cmd

|export WINEPREFIX{{=}}~/.wine
|winetricks --force setup_dxvk.verb
}}

It is recommended to create {{Path|.wine-32}} or {{Path|.wine-64}} for different architectures.

=== Installing for Lutris ===

{{Cmd
|cp -r x32 ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dxvk
|cp -r x64 ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dxvk
}}
