DXVK is [[Article description::a [[Vulkan]]-based translation layer for [[Wikipedia:Direct3D|Direct3D]] 10/11 which allows running 3D applications on Linux using [[Wine]].]]

== Requirements ==

* [[Wine]] 3.10 or newer
* [[Winetricks]] - Live build
* [[Vulkan]]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)#Compatibility Vulkan capable GPU]
* [https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Driver-support Driver supported by DXVK] (With AMD, you can check which driver is used by running lspci -k. If it says that the driver in use is radeon, your system will not be able to use DXVK.)


'''Building from source'''

* Meson build system (at least version 0.43)
* dev-util/glslang

== Installation ==

=== External repository ===

A DXVK live-ebuild is available from  [https://schlomp.space/tastytea/overlay tastytea's repository].

{{Cmd
|eselect repository enable tastytea
|emaint sync -r tastytea
|echo '~app-emulation/dxvk-9999 **' >> /etc/portage/accept_keywords/dxvk
|emerge -a app-emulation/dxvk
}}

=== Pre-built release ===

Fetch the DXVK from a release pageː

https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases

Extract itː

{{Cmd
|tar -xvf dxvk-<version>.tar.gz
|cd ~/dxvk-<version>
}}

=== From source ===

Clone the DXVK [[Git]] repository:

{{Cmd|git clone <nowiki>https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk.git</nowiki> ~/dxvk}}

Build and install DXVK:

{{Cmd
|cd ~/dxvk
|meson --cross-file build-wine64.txt --buildtype release --prefix ${PWD}/x64 --libdir ${PWD}/x64 build_64
|cd build_64
|ninja install
}}

This will create the directory {{Path|~/dxvk/x64}} which contains the 64-bit version of DXVK.
For 32 bit, replace all occurrences of 64 with 32.

== Configuration ==

=== Lutris ===

Move/copy all .so-files to ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dxvk/x{64,32}.

'''tastytea's repository:'''

{{Cmd
|mkdir -p ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dxvk/x{32,64}
|cp /usr/lib32/dxvk-9999/*.so ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dxvk/x32
|cp /usr/lib64/dxvk-9999/*.so ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dxvk/x64
}}

'''Prebuilt and compiled:'''

{{Cmd
|cp -r x32 ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dxvk
|cp -r x64 ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dxvk
}}

=== WINE ===

It is recommended to create {{Path|.wine-32}} or {{Path|.wine-64}} in /home/$USER/ for different architectures.
