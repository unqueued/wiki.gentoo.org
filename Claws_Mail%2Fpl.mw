Claws Mail is a mail client forked from [http://sylpheed.sraoss.jp/en/ Sylpheed]. In [http://www.claws-mail.org/faq/index.php/General_Information Claws Mail FAQ], it is said: ''Claws Mail has many extra features compared to Sylpheed and is more powerful, yet is just as fast, lightweight and stable.''

It is in active development, can be extended by many plugins, and allows importing of mbox-format mailboxes (coming from [[Thunderbird]], for example). Its native mailbox format is [[wikipedia:MH Message Handling System]], although the mbox format can be used with a plugin. Claws Mail cannot write HTML messages (in keeping with the Keep It Simple principle), but can read them using plugins.

For Gentoo Linux it is provided by the {{Package|mail-client/claws-mail}} package for all architectures except {{Keyword|ia64}}.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=mail-client/claws-mail}}

=== Plugins ===

Plugins are compiled with Claws Mail when the appropriate USE flags are set — <code>bogofilter</code>, <code>spamassassin</code> or <code>pdf</code>, for example.

{{Note|Before version 3.9.1 plugins had to be separately emerged.}}

==== Spam Filtering ====

* Simple way: [http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/ Bogofilter] is a powerful Bayesian filter which doesn't need to be configured. It quickly learns from the user's spam and ham classifications in Claws Mail. It is the preferred spam filter for desktop computers. Set the <code>bogofilter</code> USE flag to compile the plugin with Claws Mail.

* Hard way: [http://spamassassin.apache.org/ Spamassassin] is a huge mail filtering system, using Bayesian filtering and external spam-definition resources. It must be extensively configured and its daemon (spamd) must be running for Claws Mail to use it. It is the preferred spam filter for mail servers. Set the <code>spamassassin</code> USE flag to compile the plugin with Claws Mail. Some information can be found in the articles [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/amvisd_spamassassin_clamav|Complete Virtual Mail Server]] and [[Mailfiltering Gateway]].

=== Emerge ===

Create a {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use/claws-mail}} file to activate the desired USE flags (or add them to the {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} file). To set <code>bogofilter</code>, <code>pgp</code> and <code>archive</code>, for example:

{{RootCmd|echo 'mail-client/claws-mail bogofilter pgp archive' > /etc/portage/package.use/claws-mail}}

Then emerge Claws Mail:

{{Emerge|mail-client/claws-mail}}

== Configuration and Usage ==

* Accounts, mail filtering, models, actions, labels, etc. are set in the ''Configuration'' menu;
* main configuration is done in ''Configuration > Preferences…'';
* plugins are (de)activated in ''Configuration > Plugins…'' and configured in ''Configuration > Preferences…'';
* the archive plugin is run from ''Tools > Create Archive…'';
* the user interface can be modified: lists headers in global or message views, icons, fonts;
* the address book can import and export several formats.

=== Clawsker ===

{{Package|mail-client/clawsker}} can be installed to edit many preferences which are not in the GUI:

{{Emerge|mail-client/clawsker}}
