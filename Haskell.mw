'''Haskell''' is a purely-functional programming language.

== Compiler and interpreter ==
* The probably most important and up-to-date Haskell-implementation is the '''Glasgow Haskell Compiler''' (GHC). You can install it with <code>emerge --ask dev-lang/ghc</code>. GHC also includes an interpreter called GHCI.
* Furthermore, there's '''Hugs''', an (meanwhile (almost) out-dated) interpreter for Haskell98. You can install it with <code>emerge --ask hugs</code>.

== Cabal ==
With cabal you can package and build libraries and programs. Install it with <code>emerge --ask dev-haskell/cabal-install</code>.

== HLint ==
HLint checks and simplifies your haskell source code! Install it with <code>emerge --ask dev-haskell/hlint</code>.

== Editor plugins ==
=== Haskell-Mode for Emacs ===
The Haskell-Mode for (X)Emacs makes programming easier; install it with
* <code>emerge --ask app-emacs/haskell-mode</code> for GNU Emacs, and with
* <code>emerge --ask app-xemacs/haskell-mode</code> for XEmacs.
Then, you can configure it with <code>M-x customize-group RET haskell RET</code>.
=== Haskell-Mode for Vim ===
[http://projects.haskell.org/haskellmode-vim/ There]'s also a Haskell-Mode for Vim.
