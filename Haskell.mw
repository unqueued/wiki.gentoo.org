[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell '''Haskell'''] is a purely-functional programming language.

== Compiler and interpreter ==
* The probably most important and up-to-date Haskell-implementation is the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/ '''Glasgow Haskell Compiler'''] (GHC). You can install it with: {{Emerge|dev-lang/ghc}} The package also includes an interpreter called GHCI (except on the ARM-architecture).
* Furthermore, there's [http://www.haskell.org/hugs/ '''Hugs'''], an (meanwhile (almost) out-dated) interpreter for Haskell98. You can install it with: {{Emerge|dev-lang/hugs98}}

== Cabal ==
With [http://www.haskell.org/cabal/ '''cabal'''] you can package and build libraries and programs. Install it with: {{Emerge|dev-haskell/cabal-install}}

== HLint ==
[http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/ '''HLint'''] checks and simplifies your haskell source code! Install it with: {{Emerge|dev-haskell/hlint}}

== Editor plugins ==
=== Haskell-Mode for Emacs ===
The [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_mode_for_Emacs Haskell-Mode] for (X)Emacs makes programming easier; install it with
* {{Emerge|app-emacs/haskell-mode}} for GNU Emacs, or with
* {{Emerge|app-xemacs/haskell-mode}} for XEmacs.
Then, you can configure it with <code>M-x customize-group RET haskell RET</code>.
=== Haskell-Mode for Vim ===
[http://projects.haskell.org/haskellmode-vim/ There]'s also a Haskell-Mode for Vim.
