== Summary ==
Everything works for me apart from the special Toshiba function keys.  I list the basic configuration files in use on mine at the end of these notes.

== Hardware ==
* Intel Core i7 G4 - "Haswell".  Quad core with hyper threading
* 16 GB RAM
* 2 x 1TB hybrid SATA hard disks with 8GB of SSD each
* Built in Intel grahics and a discrete Nvidia card which can be accessed via Optimus
* 17.3" LED
* Wifi + Ethernet
* 4 USB3 interfaces
* Multi finger sense Synaptics touchpad

== Installation ==
You can install Linux without having to accept the Windows 8 license. Enter the BIOS by holding Esc and mashing F2 or F12. Disable SecureBoot and enable booting from DVD/CD.  If you get an absolutely black screen, pass acpi_backlight=vendor to the kernel command line.  Proceed as normal. 

There are two hard disks already fitted so you could consider using software RAID at install time

=== Network - Wi-Fi and Ethernet drivers: ===
And install the ebuild {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} to get the required firmware.

=== SD card reader ===

== ACPI ==
<!--
{{File|/etc/default/grub||<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux"

Bumblebee
