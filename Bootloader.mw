A '''bootloader''' is a program that will load bootable items when the system is started.

Depending on the architecture of the machine, several bootloaders are available:

* [[GRUB]] - Also known as ''GRUB Legacy''.
* [[GRUB2]] - Reworked version of GRUB. Gentoo's default bootloader on {{Keyword|x86}} and {{Keyword|amd64}}.
* [[syslinux]] - A collection of simple bootloaders for various purposes.
* [[LILO]] - A simple boot loader with some advantages over GRUB and GRUB2.
* [[EFI stub kernel]] - Using the (U)EFI firmware to function as bootloader.
