A '''bootloader''' is a program that will fire up your kernel when you start the system. Depending on the architecture of the machine, several bootloaders are available:

* [[grub]]: Also known as ''GRUB Legacy''. Gentoo's default bootloader on x86 and amd64.
* [[GRUB2|grub2]]: Reworked version of GRUB.
* [[syslinux]]: A collection of simple bootloaders for various purposes.
* [[lilo]]: A simple boot loader with some advantages over grub and grub2.
* [[EFI stub kernel]]: Using the (U)EFI firmware to function as bootloader.
