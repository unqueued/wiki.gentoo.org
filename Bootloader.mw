A '''bootloader''' is a program that will fire up your kernel when you start the system. Depending on the architecture of the machine, several bootloaders are available:

* [[Grub]] (also known as ''Grub Legacy''): Gentoo's default bootloader on x86 and amd64
* [[GRUB2]]: completely reworked version of grub
* [[LILO]]: previously standard Linux bootloader
* [[Syslinux]]: a collection of simple bootloaders for various purposes, including the pxelinux for network (diskless) boot
