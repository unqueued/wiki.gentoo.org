A '''bootloader''' is a program that will fire up your kernel when you start the system. Depending on the architecture of the machine, several bootloaders are available:

* [[GRUB]] (also known as ''GRUB Legacy''): Gentoo's default bootloader on x86 and amd64
* [[GRUB2]]: Reworked version of GRUB
* [[syslinux]]: A collection of simple bootloaders for various purposes
* [[EFI stub kernel]]: Using the (U)EFI firmware to function as bootloader
