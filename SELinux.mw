SELinux is a mandatory access control system which enables a more fine-grained mechanism where the security administrator defines what a user can do. Unlike the standard discretionary access control in place for Linux (where the end user can still decide for himself how his resources are accessed by others) a mandatory access control system is fully governed through a security policy. With SELinux, enforcement of the access controls is done by the Linux kernel, governed through a security policy that is loaded at start of the system.

Linux has a well-known ''discretionary'' access control system, based on the permission mask set on resources and the ownership of the resource versus the run-time privileges of a process. Some additional security features are available as well, such as capabilities and extended ACLs, which allow administrators to fine-tune the secure state of their system. But even all those features still prove to be discretionary in their model.

A discretionary model means that the owner of a resource can still decide how the resource is shared on the system. A directory can be made world-writable by its owner, and from that point onward all processes on the system can write to the directory. With a ''mandatory'' access control system, the access to resources is governed through a mandatory system that cannot be worked around from. With SELinux, this is the SELinux security subsystem running in the Linux kernel.

== SELinux resources ==

A [[SELinux/Quick_introduction|quick introduction to SELinux]] helps to have a high-level idea behind the SELinux security subsystem. It covers the difference between discretionary and mandatory access control, the [[SELinux/Labels|labeled]] approach that SELinux takes and how it is integrated in the Linux operating system.

== News ==
{{News|June 1, 2016|SELinux userspace 2.5 now stable|
The SELinux userspace 2.5 release has now hit stable in the Portage tree for the {{Keyword|amd64}} and {{Keyword|x86}} architectures.
}}

{{News|March 13, 2016|Userspace 2.5 is now available|
On February 23rd, the SELinux project released the 2.5 userspace. A couple of weeks later, and we're now ready for large-scale testing on Gentoo with the same 2.5 release now available in the supported architectures (~arch for now). Give it a try, and report any [https://bugs.gentoo.org bugs] or regressions you find.
