== PhotoRec ==

PhotoRec is a signature based recovery tool that is installed alongside TestDisk. PhotoRec scans partitions for file header information in order to find lost or deleted files. Since file header information is queried, PhotoRec can work on a variety of file systems and is capable of finding over [http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/File_Formats_Recovered_By_PhotoRec 400 types of files]. Files found by PhotoRec do not have their original file name; recovered data is grouped into folders and labeled with a file extension matching the header information (ASCII files are labeled {{Path|*.txt}}, JPEG files named {{Path|*.jpeg}}, PNG files named {{Path|*.png}}, etc.). In order to find the specific file, the content of each file must be searched.

Start PhotoRec:

{{Cmd|photorec}}
