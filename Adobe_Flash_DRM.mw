Amazon Instant Video (and other DRM-encumbered Flash video streams) require '''hald''' to run in order to make the Flash DRM work. '''hald''' is deprecated.

Fortunately, {{package|media-libs/hal-flash}} provides a stub library with the requisite functionality to allow DRM-encumbered Flash streams to be played. To make this and other players function correctly, simply install the plugin and library, along with a browser of your choice:
 emerge www-plugins/adobe-flash media-libs/hal-flash
