= Introduction =
Amazon Instant Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand) is an Internet video on demand service offered by Amazon.com in the United States. It offers television shows and films for rental and purchase.

{{Note|It maybe more appropriate to move this article to an article titled 'Adobe Flash DRM'?}}

= Adobe Flash DRM =
Most Amazon Instant Video and other DRM-encumbered Flash video streams require '''hald''' to allow the Flash DRM media to be properly presented or played. '''hald''' has been deprecated for awhile, and furthermore, Adobe Flash DRM has been assumed to never be fixed to work without this '''hald''' requisite.

Fortunately, {{package|media-libs/hal-flash}} provides a working stub library providing this '''hald''' requisite successfully allowing DRM Flash streams to be played.

To make this and other players function correctly, simply install the plugin and library along with a browser of your choice:
