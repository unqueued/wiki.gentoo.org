== Introduction ==
Amazon Instant Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand) is an Internet video on demand service offered by Amazon.com in the United States. It offers television shows and films for rental and purchase.

{{Note|A Roku Streaming device maybe a better option for some.  Roku Streaming devices connecting to televisions via HDMI, cost less than $100, and do away with the requirement of maintaining a computer.  The Amazon Instant Video service also provides enhanced HD video and/or A52/AC3/Dolby streams for these devices, and require little power.  I'd suggest a Roku 3, as this model includes an ethernet port instead of only problematic wireless.  These devices require a good fast cable Internet Service Provider!}}

== Adobe Flash DRM ==
Most Amazon Instant Video and other DRM-encumbered Flash video streams require '''hald''' to allow the Flash DRM media to be properly presented or played. '''hald''' has been deprecated for awhile, and furthermore, Adobe Flash DRM has been assumed to never be fixed to work without this '''hald''' requisite.

Fortunately, {{package|media-libs/hal-flash}} provides a working stub library providing this '''hald''' requisite successfully allowing DRM Flash streams to be played.

== Install Flash DRM Support ==
To make this and other players function correctly, simply install the plugin and library along with a browser of your choice:
{{RootCmd|emerge www-plugins/adobe-flash media-libs/hal-flash}}

== Test Adobe Flash DRM ==
The Adobe hosted webpage titled [http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/protected-video-content-play.html Protected video content does not play] contains further instructions on [http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/protected-video-content-play.html#id_79509 How to test playing Adobe Flash DRM content] at the bottom of the page.
