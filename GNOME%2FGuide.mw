<!--T:1-->
A frequently used environment is GNOME. This HOWTO tries to describe all aspects of GNOME, including installation, configuration, usage, ...

== What is GNOME? == <!--T:2-->

=== The Project === <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
The [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] project is a free software project dedicated to the development of GNOME, a Unix/Linux desktop suite and development platform. The [http://foundation.gnome.org GNOME Foundation] coordinates the development and other aspects of the GNOME Project. 

=== The Software === <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
GNOME is a desktop environment and a development platform. This piece of free software is the desktop of choice for several industry leaders. It is interesting both for business users, home users as well as developers. 

=== The Community === <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
Like with any big free software project, GNOME has an extensive user- and development base. [http://planet.gnome.org GnomePlanet] is a popular blog aggregator for GNOME hackers and contributors whereas [http://developer.gnome.org Developer.Gnome.Org] is for the GNOME developers. [http://library.gnome.org/users/ GNOME Library] contains a huge list of GNOME resources for end users. The [http://worldofgnome.org/ World of GNOME] is also a popular aggregator for GNOME-related news. 

== Installing GNOME == <!--T:9-->

=== What do you need? === <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
{{Important|First read and follow the instructions in the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration X Server Configuration Howto] to setup your X environment.}}

<!--T:12-->
Before you start installing GNOME, you might want to edit your USE variables. Make sure that <code>X</code> , <code>gtk</code> , and <code>gnome</code> are in your USE variable listed in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} . If you want support for <code>dbus</code> , a system message bus Gnome uses extensively, add it to your USE flags. If you don't want KDE support (the other big desktop environment), remove <code>qt4</code> and <code>kde</code>. 

<!--T:13-->
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf|Example flags for a GNOME environment|<pre>
USE="-qt4 -kde X dbus gtk gnome"
</pre>
}}

<!--T:14-->
You can add the <code>branding</code> USE flag to get a lovely Gentoo-branded splashscreen instead of the default Gnome splashscreen: 

<!--T:15-->
{{RootCmd|echo "gnome-base/gnome-session branding" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

<!--T:16-->
{{Note|If you use the <code>desktop</code> profile, these USE flags will be set for you. You can check your profile by running <code>eselect profile list</code> and <code>eselect profile set <profile-name></code> as root.}}

<!--T:17-->
Once done, start installing GNOME by emerging <code>gnome</code> : 

<!--T:18-->
{{RootCmd|emerge gnome}}

<!--T:19-->
You can also opt for a minimal Gnome installation using <code>gnome-light</code> . If you do so, you will have a lightweight Gnome installation without the additional tools that a full Gnome installation provides so you might need to install additional packages afterwards.

<!--T:20-->
{{RootCmd|emerge gnome-light}}

<!--T:21-->
This will take a while, so you might want to start reading all those books your mother bought you but you never opened. Done? Great, now update your environment variables: 

<!--T:22-->
{{RootCmd|env-update && source /etc/profile}}

<!--T:23-->
Next we'll clean up the remaining services and user groups. 

<!--T:24-->
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/dbus start
|rc-update add dbus default}}

<!--T:25-->
Check if the ''plugdev'' group exists. If it does, it is adviseable to make yourself member of that group, but this is optional (the group is not that common anymore). 

<!--T:26-->
{{RootCmd|getent group plugdev|output=<pre>
plugdev:x:104:
</pre>}}

<!--T:27-->
Substitute yourUserName with your user name.

<!--T:28-->
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a yourUserName plugdev}}

=== First Impressions === <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->
Let us first take a look at what we just built. Exit your root shell and log on as a regular user. We will configure our session to run GNOME when we issue the <code>startx</code> command (see also [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration#Using_startx Using startx] in the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration X Server Configuration Howto] ): 

<!--T:31-->
{{Cmd|echo "exec gnome-session" > ~/.xinitrc}}

<!--T:32-->
Starting with <code>gnome-base/gnome-session-2.26.2</code> , you will need to prepend the XDG_MENU_PREFIX variable to get the Gnome menus if you're using the {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} method to start your desktop. (If you're not using {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} , it will be handled automatically for you; no additional configuration is needed.) 

<!--T:33-->
{{Cmd|sed -i '1i\export XDG_MENU_PREFIX{{=}}gnome-' ~/.xinitrc}}

<!--T:34-->
Now start your graphical environment by running <code>startx</code> : 

<!--T:35-->
{{Cmd|startx}}

<!--T:36-->
If all goes well, you should be greeted by GNOME. Congratulations. Now let us take a look at how you can configure GNOME to suit your needs. 

== Configuring GNOME == <!--T:37-->

=== GNOME's Graphical Login Manager === <!--T:38-->

<!--T:39-->
If you want the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) to run automatically when you boot (so you can log on graphically), you must add the <code>xdm</code> init script to the default runlevel: 

<!--T:40-->
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

<!--T:41-->
Now edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/xdm}} and alter the DISPLAYMANAGER variable. 

<!--T:42-->
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm|Making GDM the preferred display manager|<pre>
DISPLAYMANAGER="gdm"
</pre>
}}

<!--T:43-->
If you installed Gnome using the <code>gnome-light</code> package, you will need to install <code>gdm</code> too (as it is not defined as part of the <code>gnome-light</code> package). 

<!--T:44-->
{{RootCmd|emerge gdm}}

<!--T:45-->
If you reboot now, the GNOME Display Manager will prompt you for your username and password and will default to using GNOME as Desktop Environment (even though you will have the option of selecting a different one of course, choosing from those available in {{Path|/usr/share/xsessions/}} ). Thus, if you use GDM, you don't need to edit {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} .
