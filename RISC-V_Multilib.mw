As riscv has a few [[RISC-V ABIs|ABIs]] multilib story it a bit complicated as well.

Gentoo will use multilib compatible LIBDIR layout for both multilib and non-multilib profiles.
TODO: add details on gcc's multilib LIBDIR and compiler flags setup and on what other distros do.

== rv64gc ==
This is the 64bit architecture (rv64) with extensions imadfc (i.e., g is a shorthand for imadf). It supports 2 ABIs, lp64 (softfloat) and lp64d (hardfloat double). 

The gcc default is
 -march=rv64gc -mabi=lp64d

Our multilib structure follows the guidelines as implemented in GCC:
 # from profiles/arch/riscv/rv64gc/make.defaults
 
 # Library directories
 LIBDIR_lp64d="lib64/lp64d"
 LIBDIR_lp64="lib64/lp64"
 SYMLINK_LIB="no"
 
 # Flags for lp64d
 CFLAGS_lp64d="-mabi=lp64d"
 
 # Flags for lp64
 CFLAGS_lp64="-mabi=lp64"

== rv32i ==

This is the 32bit architecture, which is not supported by glibc yet.
