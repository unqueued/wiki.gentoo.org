This guide introduces the migration of Samba3 to Samba4 with LDAP on Gentoo boxes.

== Pre-requisite ==
* A working samba 3.6.x NT PDC with LDAP backend(Must be PDC as it will be '''Promote''' to AD)
* Samba AD DNS Planing
* Samba AD and DNS understanding 
* LDAP Auth Backend Database (Optional)
* Python 2.7 as ABI 


{{Warning|
Do not test migration in your production environment, Once a Windows client finds and connects to the new server, it is not possible to go back! the windows client will never talk to your samba 3 server even if you remove/downgrade the samba 4 Server.
So make sure you thoroughly test your migration on a virtual environment and how your clients react before you activate your new server in your production environment! 
}}


=== Samba DNS Planing ===
* Moving from samba3 to samba AD is not easy due to the fact that the idea wasn't the same.
* Samba AD required you to have a resolvable DNS.
* MS suggest to use a FQDN as an AD Server as it is easily scalable in future.
* There are some suggestion to use suffixes of .local, .lan .corp but these are bad idea, very bad idea indeed. As we have no understanding what suffixes ICANN will use  in future. And having a DNS with that suffix will conflict with the external DNS.

Thus we would hope that you use the following suggestion.

==== FQDN subdomain DNS setup ====
Example you own "company.com" and it is hosting by your web hosting company.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! FQDN !! Description
|-
| company.com. || main internet address point to your web server.
|-
| www.company.com. || points to webserver ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company)
|-
| mail01.company.com.|| points to mail server 1 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|-
| mail02.company.com. ||  points to mail Server 2 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|-
| smtp1.company.com.|| points to smtp server 1 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|-
| smtp2.company.com. || points to smtp server 2 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|-
| smtp3.company.com. || points to smtp server 3 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|}

Samba AD and internal subdomain DNS setup  

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! FQDN !! Description
|-
| headoffice.location1.company.com. || head office subdomain
|-
| samba4-1.headoffice.location1.company.com. || Samba AD FQDN
|}
in the above example:<br />
NETBIOS NAME: HEADOFFICE

'''''So the most important setup.'''''

hostname = samba4-1.headoffice.company.com<br />
AD = headoffice.company.com<br />
REALM = HEADOFFICE.COMPANY.COM<br />
DOMAINNAME ( NT Style )  COMPANY<br />

'''Benefit'''
# A clear cut on internal and external DNS.
# There will not be any conflict between internal and also external DNS.
# In case if there are Branch Site, the Branch AD FQDN can be another subdomain: ''samba4-2.branch_CA.company.com.''
# We can also make the subdomain public if need and that make this design future proof.

==== Samba AD DNS setup ====
Samba AD required DNS Server to work, so if you have an DNS server running on the same server before.
You will need to change it to support Samba or replace it to Samba internal DNS. The choice are your.

If you would like to run 2 DNS server differently, it will waste as samba internal DNS also can provied DNS forwarding feature, just you need some tweak.

There are 2 Options in Samba DNS setup.
* Samba Internal DNS : This is simplest and easier. Configuration using Microsoft DNS Management tools.
* Bind 9.8/9.8 Server : This is another choice that Samba team provide. If you are currently running Bind DNS, you might preferd this method.

=== What is Samba AD ===
Samba AD have the following feature
* Samba files Sharing (the most important)
* LDAP Server with MS Specified Schema which is working as an Active Directory
* DNS Server which work together in and Active Directory
* Kerberos Server

All 4 feature need to run for a success fully deploy Active Directory.
If you have been using LDAP Centralize Authentication and Management, you might want to run LDAP different from the current Samba IP until you have migrate all authentication to winbind.

{{Note|Someone please help to write more about winbind authentication for Linux}}

=== Python 2.7 ABI ===
Run the following command to check if python2.7 is ABI

{{RootCmd|eselect python list|output=<pre>
Available Python interpreters:
  [1]   python2.7 *
  [2]   python3.2
</pre>}}

If the result are not the same run the following command

{{RootCmd|eselect python set 1}}

=== Checking SambaSID for duplication ===

We will now check for SambaSID duplication
You can use the following code which is from the samba ClassUpgrade/HOWTO <ref name="classicupgrade">[https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/samba-tool/domain/classicupgrade/HOWTO]https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/samba-tool/domain/classicupgrade/HOWTO</ref>
{{Code||<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
# A quick and dirty python script that checks for duplicat SID's using slapcat.
import os
 
data = os.popen("slapcat | grep sambaSID", 'r')
line = []
 
def anydup(thelist):
        dups = list(set([x for x in thelist if thelist.count(x) > 1]))
        for i in dups:
                print "Duplicate id: ", i
 
for each_line in data:
        line.append(each_line.strip())
 
anydup(line)
</pre>}}

=== Checking Samba username and groupname for duplication ===
Unfortunately, there are no program for this.
You will have to do it manually.

if you are using smbldap-tools, you can use the following command and manually compare their different.
{{RootCmd
|smbldap-grouplist
|smbldap-userlist
}}

{{Note|Please help write a python program for this}}

== Getting Samba4 ==

=== Getting ready before Samba4 ===
There are 2 options to get samba 4 compile, just choose the one that you preferred.<br />
There isn't much different in usage, just the way of getting it.

==== Options 1, internal heimdal (Need to create customized ebuild) ====
Samba4 is already in portage, however it is still mask and there are some bugs related to it. <br />
A few of them are affecting us. Make the patch in and run your ebuild.
# {{Bug|490872}} Mit-krb5 conflict with hemidal issue, resolve using internal hemidal library.

This bugs are very important as you might have difficult on removing the need of mit-Krb5 (in most case)<br />
Please apply this patch and make your own ebuild.<br />
{{Note|Unless if this bugs had been agreed and are check-in to gentoo main portage. You will need to maintain this extra ebuild until this bugs is fixed.}}

{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/net-fs/samba/
|cd /usr/local/portage/net-fs/samba/
|cp -avr /usr/portage/net-fs/samba/samba-4.1.2.*
|cp -avr /usr/portage/net-fs/samba/files files/
}}

download the patch from '''Bug 490872''' that fit your version save it as patch
Apply the patch, any way you like.

{{RootCmd|patch -p patch}}

rebuild ebuild Manifest, it will download samba source and check on it.
{{RootCmd|ebuild samba-4.1.2.ebuild Manifest}}

===== Special Useflag =====
{{USEflag|package=net-fs/samba
|bi_heimdal++Yes+Use Build in heimdal library
}}
Please add this extra useflag

{{File|/etc/portage/package.use|add this extra useflag, for example|<pre>
net-fs/samba bi_heimdal ads addns cluster winbind quota syslog fam
</pre>}}

Jump to emerge samba

==== Options 2, Remove system wide mit-krb5 and replace with heimdal ====
This might not be as challenge as compare to option 1 but there are some other challenge.
{{Note|If you face the following:<br />
kernel: traps: getent[3691] general protection ip:7fd9b7a229f8 sp:a7e5ddc470aa4ca0 error:0 in ld-2.16.so[7fd9b7a0c000+21000] <br />
It Can only temporary fix it by removing all ldap in /etc/nsswitch.conf<br />
This issue is fixed with the latest nss_ldap-265-r2
Please unmask it and emerge it manually 
}}
===== Remove mit-krb5 dependency =====
You will need to to check which package are dependent on mit-krb5
{{RootCmd|equery d mit-krb5||output=<pre>
 * These packages depend on mit-krb5:
dev-libs/openssl-1.0.1e-r1 (kerberos ? app-crypt/mit-krb5)
net-libs/c-client-2007f-r4 (kerberos ? app-crypt/mit-krb5)
virtual/krb5-0 (app-crypt/mit-krb5)
</pre>}}

remove the '''kerberos''' useflag and recompile these package<br />
but leave '''virtual/krb5-0''' untouch, we need that later.

{{File|/etc/portage/package.use|Example adding openssl and c-client|<pre>
dev-libs/openssl -kerberos
net-libs/c-client -kerberos
</pre>}}

Emerge your new package with mit-krb5 dependency removed.

{{emerge|openssl c-client|params=--ask --newuse --verbose}}

Check if the kerberos useflag had be removed.

===== Unmerge mit-krb5 =====
We will now remove mit-krb.

{{Warning|if you skip the above steps, some system will not be responding}}

{{emerge|mit-krb5|params=--ask --unmerge }}

===== Emerge heimdal =====
We can now emerge app-crypt/heimdal kerberos. 
{{emerge|app-crypt/heimdal}}

Now rebuild all package which need kerberos library.<br />
'''virtual/krb5-0''' was the build so that if a package can compile with either of the kerberos library, we can choose either one. 

{{RootCmd|revdep-rebuild}}

When done we can continue emerge samba.

==== Emerge Samba ====
For more on samba4 bugs please have a look on the bugs tracker below.<br />

===== unmaks Samba =====
Before this let unmask samba 4
{{File|/etc/portage/package.unmask|add this line in|<pre>
=net-fs/samba-4.1.2
</pre>}}

{{Emerge|{{=}}net-fs/samba-4.1.2}}

Please wait and allow samba4 to build.

When it is done we can continue configuration samba4.

== Migration samba 3 to samba 4 configuration ==
We will now prepaid to do an classic upgrade from samba 3 to samba 4.
Before that please run test-parm to make sure all configuration on the samba3 is correct. The migration will fail if it see some outdated/obsolete config
{{Note|We assume that you are currently running samba 3.6.x as it compatibility to samba4 is better.}}

{{RootCmd
|testparm /etc/samba/smb.conf|output=<pre>
Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
WARNING: The "password level" option is deprecated
Processing section "[homes]"
WARNING: The "username" option is deprecated
</pre>}}

Change or remove any '''WARNING''' configuration.

We assume that both old and new server are on the same host. Else you can copy them to another host.
{{RootCmd
|scp -r /var/lib/samba/private/ /var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/
|scp /etc/samba/smb.conf /var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/
}}

If you wish to change the host name of the new server, you can change the netbios name in the Samba3 conf file that you have copy over.<br />
{{Note|For some reason the samba4 classical upgrade tools will fail if you use hostname on the ldap entry. Please change your ldap domain name from dns to ip. <ref name="classicupgradebugs">[https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9186]https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9186</ref>}}
=== Migration Start ===
Now it is time to stop samba.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/samba stop}}
And run you migratation choose one of the following for different DNS configuration.
You can change it later after running.

Samba 4 AD with Bind9 DLZ Module
DLZ is for windows client to do dns update to bind9 

{{RootCmd|samba-tool domain classicupgrade --dbdir{{=}}/var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/  --use-xattrs{{=}}yes  --realm{{=}}headoffice.location1.company.com --dns-backend{{=}}BIND9_DLZ /var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/samba3.conf}}

Samba 4 AD with internal DNS Module
{{RootCmd|samba-tool domain classicupgrade --dbdir{{=}}/var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/  --use-xattrs{{=}}yes  --realm{{=}}headoffice.location1.company.com /var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/samba3.conf}}

You should not see any error message from this command. if you do you will have to re-run the above command again.
=== Testing of Migration ===
As per said Samba AD do consist LDAP and also DNS.
so you have to turn off your slapd and also other DNS if you are using samba internal DNS.

{{RootCmd|samba -i -M single}}

{{Note|You might need to change your Administrator password using the following command}}
{{RootCmd|samba-tool user password -U Administrator}}
Smbclient test
{{RootCmd|smbclient //localhost/netlogon -UAdministrator -c 'ls'|output=<pre>
Domain=[SAMDOM] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.x.y]
  .                                   D        0  Tue Dec 11 20:00:00 2012
  ..                                  D        0  Tue Dec 11 20:00:00 2012
</pre>}}
=== Internal Samba DNS Setup ===
If you would allow DNS forward to 8.8.8.8 for all PC client to the internet, please setup the following in your new /etc/samba/smb.conf<br />
Also you should also allow dns update from windows client to samba DNS. 
{{Note|I don't understand while the time I'm writing this, please add more info}}
{{File|/etc/samba/smb.conf|add this line to forward dns|<pre>
#Samba Internal DNS options
        dns forwarder = 8.8.8.8
        allow dns updates = nonsecure
</pre>}}
=== Bind DNS DLZ module Setup ===
{{Note| Todo}}

=== Sub function test ===
AS per said before, samba include dns, ldap and kerberos in a full AD environment.<br />
We will need to do a full test it now.

Before that we need to change our /etc/resolv.conf so that it is using samba dns. Krb and ldap don't work fully without that.<br />
Set nameserver ip to your current samba server ip. e.g 192.168.0.10. 
{{File|/etc/resolv.conf|change to the following line|<pre>
search headoffice.company.com
nameserver 192.168.0.10
</pre>}}

==== DNS sub function test ====
Your result on the following dns query should be identical or very similar. 

{{RootCmd|host -t SRV _kerberos._udp.headoffice.company.com.|output=<pre>
_kerberos._udp.example.com has SRV record 0 100 88 samba4-1.headoffice.company.com.
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|host -t SRV _ldap._tcp.headoffice.company.com.|output=<pre>
_ldap._tcp.example.com has SRV record 0 100 389 samba4-1.headoffice.company.com.
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|host -t A samba4-1.headoffice.company.com.|output=<pre>
samba4-1.headoffice.company.com has address 192.168.0.10
</pre>}}

==== Kerberous sub function test ====
There should not be any error prompt when your password is the administrator password on the samba AD.
{{RootCmd|kinit administrator@HEADOFFICE.COMPANY.COM|output=<pre>
Password:
</pre>}}

=== Final Setup ===
Finally we will need make the following 

{{File|/etc/conf.d/samba|Changing to samba4 deamon|<pre>
# Add "winbind" to the daemon_list if you also want winbind to start.
# Replace "smbd nmbd" by "samba4" if you want the active directory domain controller part or the ntvfs
# file server part or the rpc proxy to start.
# Note that samba4 controls 'smbd' by itself, thus it can't be started manually. You can, however,
# tweak the behaviour of a samba4-controlled smbd by modifying your '/etc/samba/smb.conf' file
# accordingly.
daemon_list="samba4"
</pre>}}
