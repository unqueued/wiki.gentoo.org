This guide introduces the migration of Samba3 to Samba4 with LDAP on Gentoo boxes.

== Pre-requisite ==
* A working samba 3.6.x NT PDC with LDAP backend(Must be PDC as it will be '''Promote''' to AD)
* Samba AD DNS Planing
* Samba AD and DNS understanding 
* LDAP Auth Backend Database (Optional)
* Python 2.7 as ABI 


{{Warning|
Do not test migration in your production environment, Once a Windows client finds and connects to the new server, it is not possible to go back! the windows client will never talk to your samba 3 server even if you remove/downgrade the samba 4 Server.
So make sure you thoroughly test your migration on a virtual environment and how your clients react before you activate your new server in your production environment! 
}}


=== Samba DNS Planing ===
* Moving from samba3 to samba AD is not easy due to the fact that the idea wasn't the same.
* Samba AD required you to have a resolvable DNS.
* MS suggest to use a FQDN as an AD Server as it is easily scalable in future.
* There are some suggestion to use suffixes of .local, .lan .corp but these are bad idea, very bad idea indeed. As we have no understanding what suffixes ICANN will use  in future. And having a DNS with that suffix will conflict with the external DNS.

Thus we would hope that you use the following suggestion.

==== FQDN subdomain DNS setup ====
Example you own "company.com" and it is hosting by your web hosting company.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! FQDN !! Description
|-
| company.com. || main internet address point to your web server.
|-
| www.company.com. || points to webserver ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company)
|-
| mail01.company.com.|| points to mail server 1 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|-
| mail02.company.com. ||  points to mail Server 2 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|-
| smtp1.company.com.|| points to smtp server 1 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|-
| smtp2.company.com. || points to smtp server 2 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|-
| smtp3.company.com. || points to smtp server 3 ( Public IP Address, by your web hosting company )
|}

Samba AD and internal subdomain DNS setup  

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! FQDN !! Description
|-
| headoffice.location1.company.com. || head office subdomain
|-
| samba4-1.headoffice.location1.company.com. || Samba AD FQDN
|}
in the above example:<br />
NETBIOS NAME: HEADOFFICE

'''''So the most important setup.'''''

hostname = samba4-1.headoffice.company.com<br />
AD = headoffice.company.com<br />
REALM = HEADOFFICE.COMPANY.COM<br />
DOMAINNAME ( NT Style )  COMPANY<br />

'''Benefit'''
# A clear cut on internal and external DNS.
# There will not be any conflict between internal and also external DNS.
# In case if there are Branch Site, the Branch AD FQDN can be another subdomain: ''samba4-2.branch_CA.company.com.''
# We can also make the subdomain public if need and that make this design future proof.

==== Samba AD DNS setup ====
Samba AD required DNS Server to work, so if you have an DNS server running on the same server before.
You will need to change it to support Samba or replace it to Samba internal DNS. The choice are your.

If you would like to run 2 DNS server differently, it will waste as samba internal DNS also can provied DNS forwarding feature, just you need some tweak.

There are 2 Options in Samba DNS setup.
* Samba Internal DNS : This is simplest and easier. Configuration using Microsoft DNS Management tools.
* Bind 9.8/9.8 Server : This is another choice that Samba team provide. If you are currently running Bind DNS, you might preferd this method.

=== What is Samba AD ===
Samba AD have the following feature
* Samba files Sharing (the most important)
* LDAP Server with MS Specified Schema which is working as an Active Directory
* DNS Server which work together in and Active Directory
* Kerberos Server

All 4 feature need to run for a success fully deploy Active Directory.
If you have been using LDAP Centralize Authentication and Management, you might want to run LDAP different from the current Samba IP until you have migrate all authentication to winbind.

{{Note|Someone please help to write more about winbind authentication for Linux}}

=== Python 2.7 ABI ===
Run the following command to check if python2.7 is ABI

{{RootCmd|eselect python list|output=<pre>
Available Python interpreters:
  [1]   python2.7 *
  [2]   python3.2
</pre>}}

If the result are not the same run the following command

{{RootCmd|eselect python set 1}}

=== Checking SambaSID for duplication ===

We will now check for SambaSID duplication
You can use the following code which is from the samba ClassUpgrade/HOWTO<ref name="classicupgrade">[https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/samba-tool/domain/classicupgrade/HOWTO Samba classicupgrade/HOWTO]</ref>
{{Code||<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
# A quick and dirty python script that checks for duplicat SID's using slapcat.
import os
 
data = os.popen("slapcat | grep sambaSID", 'r')
line = []
 
def anydup(thelist):
        dups = list(set([x for x in thelist if thelist.count(x) > 1]))
        for i in dups:
                print "Duplicate id: ", i
 
for each_line in data:
        line.append(each_line.strip())
 
anydup(line)
</pre>}}

=== Checking Samba username and groupname for duplication ===
Unfortunately, there are no program for this.
You will have to do it manually.

if you are using smbldap-tools, you can use the following command and manually compare their different.
{{RootCmd
|smbldap-grouplist
|smbldap-userlist
}}

{{Note|Please help write a python program for this}}

== Getting Samba4 ==

=== Getting ready before Samba4 ===
There are 2 options to get samba 4 compile, just choose the one that you preferred.<br />
There isn't much different in usage, just the way of getting it.

==== Options 1, internal heimdal (Need to create customized ebuild) ====
Samba4 is already in portage, however it is still mask and there are some bugs related to it. <br />
A few of them are affecting us. Make the patch in and run your ebuild.
# {{Bug|490872}} Mit-krb5 conflict with hemidal issue, resolve using internal hemidal library.

This bugs are very important as you might have difficult on removing the need of mit-Krb5 (in most case)<br />
Please apply this patch and make your own ebuild.<br />
{{Note|Unless if this bugs had been agreed and are check-in to gentoo main portage. You will need to maintain this extra ebuild until this bugs is fixed.}}

{{RootCmd
|mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/net-fs/samba/
|cd /usr/local/portage/net-fs/samba/
|cp -avr /usr/portage/net-fs/samba/samba-4.1.2.*
|cp -avr /usr/portage/net-fs/samba/files files/
}}

download the patch from '''Bug 490872''' that fit your version save it as patch
Apply the patch, any way you like.

{{RootCmd|patch -p patch}}

rebuild ebuild Manifest, it will download samba source and check on it.
{{RootCmd|ebuild samba-4.1.2.ebuild Manifest}}

===== Special Useflag =====
{{USEflag|package=net-fs/samba
|bi_heimdal++Yes+Use Build in heimdal library
}}
Please add this extra useflag

{{File|/etc/portage/package.use|add this extra useflag, for example|<pre>
net-fs/samba bi_heimdal ads addns cluster winbind quota syslog fam
</pre>}}

Jump to emerge samba

==== Options 2, Remove system wide mit-krb5 and replace with heimdal ====
This might not be as challenge as compare to option 1 but there are some other challenge.
{{Note|If you face the following:<br />
kernel: traps: getent[3691] general protection ip:7fd9b7a229f8 sp:a7e5ddc470aa4ca0 error:0 in ld-2.16.so[7fd9b7a0c000+21000] <br />
It Can only temporary fix it by removing all ldap in /etc/nsswitch.conf<br />
This issue is fixed with the latest nss_ldap-265-r2
Please unmask it and emerge it manually 
}}
===== Remove mit-krb5 dependency =====
You will need to to check which package are dependent on mit-krb5
{{RootCmd|equery d mit-krb5||output=<pre>
 * These packages depend on mit-krb5:
dev-libs/openssl-1.0.1e-r1 (kerberos ? app-crypt/mit-krb5)
net-libs/c-client-2007f-r4 (kerberos ? app-crypt/mit-krb5)
virtual/krb5-0 (app-crypt/mit-krb5)
</pre>}}

remove the '''kerberos''' useflag and recompile these package<br />
but leave '''virtual/krb5-0''' untouch, we need that later.

{{File|/etc/portage/package.use|Example adding openssl and c-client|<pre>
dev-libs/openssl -kerberos
net-libs/c-client -kerberos
</pre>}}

Emerge your new package with mit-krb5 dependency removed.

{{emerge|openssl c-client|params=--ask --newuse --verbose}}

Check if the kerberos useflag had be removed.

===== Unmerge mit-krb5 =====
We will now remove mit-krb.

{{Warning|if you skip the above steps, some system will not be responding}}

{{emerge|mit-krb5|params=--ask --unmerge }}

===== Emerge heimdal =====
We can now emerge app-crypt/heimdal kerberos. 
{{emerge|app-crypt/heimdal}}

Now rebuild all package which need kerberos library.<br />
'''virtual/krb5-0''' was the build so that if a package can compile with either of the kerberos library, we can choose either one. 

{{RootCmd|revdep-rebuild}}

When done we can continue emerge samba.

==== Emerge Samba ====
For more on samba4 bugs please have a look on the bugs tracker below.<br />
{{Bug|489762}} Samba4 unmask bugs tracker.

===== unmaks Samba =====
Before this let unmask samba 4
{{File|/etc/portage/package.unmask|add this line in|<pre>
=net-fs/samba-4.1.2
</pre>}}

{{Emerge|{{=}}net-fs/samba-4.1.2}}

Please wait and allow samba4 to build.

When it is done we can continue configuration samba4.

== Migration samba 3 to samba 4 configuration ==
We will now prepaid to do an classic upgrade from samba 3 to samba 4.
Before that please run test-parm to make sure all configuration on the samba3 is correct. The migration will fail if it see some outdated/obsolete config
{{Note|We assume that you are currently running samba 3.6.x as it compatibility to samba4 is better.}}

{{RootCmd
|testparm /etc/samba/smb.conf|output=<pre>
Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
WARNING: The "password level" option is deprecated
Processing section "[homes]"
WARNING: The "username" option is deprecated
</pre>}}

Change or remove any '''WARNING''' configuration.

We assume that both old and new server are on the same host. Else you can copy them to another host.
{{RootCmd
|scp -r /var/lib/samba/private/ /var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/
|scp /etc/samba/smb.conf /var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/
}}

If you wish to change the host name of the new server, you can change the netbios name in the Samba3 conf file that you have copy over.<br />
{{Warning|Change netbios name might caused services using existing netbios name to fail, it effect are huge if you existing using that name widely, you have been warn}}
{{Note|For some reason the samba4 classical upgrade tools will fail if you use hostname on the ldap entry. Please change your ldap domain name from dns to ip. Samba Bug 9186<ref name="classicupgradebugs">[https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9186 Samba Bug 9186]</ref>}}
=== Migration Start ===
Now it is time to stop samba.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/samba stop}}
And run you migratation choose one of the following for different DNS configuration.
You can change it later after running.

Samba 4 AD with Bind9 DLZ Module
DLZ is for windows client to do dns update to bind9 

{{RootCmd|samba-tool domain classicupgrade --dbdir{{=}}/var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/  --use-xattrs{{=}}yes  --realm{{=}}headoffice.location1.company.com --dns-backend{{=}}BIND9_DLZ /var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/samba3.conf}}

Samba 4 AD with internal DNS Module
{{RootCmd|samba-tool domain classicupgrade --dbdir{{=}}/var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/  --use-xattrs{{=}}yes  --realm{{=}}headoffice.location1.company.com /var/lib/samba/samba3tdb/samba3.conf}}

You should not see any error message from this command. if you do you will have to re-run the above command again.
=== Testing of Migration ===
As per said Samba AD do consist LDAP and also DNS.
so you have to turn off your slapd and also other DNS if you are using samba internal DNS.

{{RootCmd|samba -i -M single}}

{{Note|You might need to change your Administrator password using the following command}}
{{RootCmd|samba-tool user password -U Administrator}}
Smbclient test
{{RootCmd|smbclient //localhost/netlogon -UAdministrator -c 'ls'|output=<pre>
Domain=[SAMDOM] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.x.y]
  .                                   D        0  Tue Dec 11 20:00:00 2012
  ..                                  D        0  Tue Dec 11 20:00:00 2012
</pre>}}
=== Internal Samba DNS Setup ===
If you would allow DNS forward to 8.8.8.8 for all PC client to the internet, please setup the following in your new /etc/samba/smb.conf<br />
Also you should also allow dns update from windows client to samba DNS. 
{{Note|I don't understand while the time I'm writing this, please add more info}}
{{File|/etc/samba/smb.conf|add this line to forward dns|<pre>
#Samba Internal DNS options
        dns forwarder = 8.8.8.8
        allow dns updates = nonsecure
</pre>}}
=== Bind DNS DLZ module Setup ===
Having Bind DNZ DLZ working with samba4 AD is somehow simple.<br />
But still we need to do the following.
# Change of Samba DLZ Module version.
# Change the permission on /var/lib/samba/private/ so that named can access
# Change /etc/bind/named.conf to include the files inside /var/lib/samba/private/

==== Change of /var/lib/samba/private/named.conf ====
Uncomment the proper bind module according to the bind version you have.

{{RootCmd|named -v|output=<pre>
BIND 9.9.3-P2 (Extended Support Version)
</pre>}}

{{File|/var/lib/samba/private/named.conf||<pre>
dlz "AD DNS Zone" {
    # For BIND 9.8.0
    # database "dlopen /usr/lib64/samba/bind9/dlz_bind9.so";

    # For BIND 9.9.0
    database "dlopen /usr/lib64/samba/bind9/dlz_bind9_9.so";
};
</pre>}}

==== Getting permission on /var/lib/samba/private/ ====
This is tricky but not hard to do, still doubt arise about it security where named need to access samba private folder, which is default 400.<br />
We will try to use ACL to make life simple (since it is default required by samba4)
{{RootCmd
|setfacl -m u:named:rx /var/lib/samba/private/
|setfacl -m u:named:rx /var/lib/samba/private/named.*
|setfacl -m u:named:rx -R /var/lib/samba/private/dns
|setfacl -m u:named:rx /var/lib/samba/private/dns*
}}

==== Change of /etc/bind/named.conf ====
We would now need to make 2 change in named.conf<br />
{{Note|You don't create any primary zone or reverse zone with your samba sub domain. That will be done automatically}}

1. Samba gssapi keytab 
If you follow [[BIND/Tutorial]] put it under "options section"
{{File|/etc/bind/named.conf||<pre>
tkey-gssapi-keytab "/var/lib/samba/private/dns.keytab";
</pre>}}

2. Samba4 AD DLZ
If you follow [[BIND/Tutorial]] put it under "Internal view/External view"<br />
According to your AD design.
{{File|/etc/bind/named.conf||<pre>
include "/var/lib/samba/private/named.conf";
</pre>}}

You are now done<br />
reload bind.

=== Sub function test ===
AS per said before, samba include dns, ldap and kerberos in a full AD environment.<br />
We will need to do a full test it now.

Before that we need to change our /etc/resolv.conf so that it is using samba dns. Krb and ldap don't work fully without that.<br />
Set nameserver ip to your current samba server ip. e.g 192.168.0.10. 
{{File|/etc/resolv.conf|change to the following line|<pre>
search headoffice.company.com
nameserver 192.168.0.10
</pre>}}

==== DNS sub function test ====
Your result on the following dns query should be identical or very similar. 

{{RootCmd|host -t SRV _kerberos._udp.headoffice.company.com.|output=<pre>
_kerberos._udp.headoffice.company.com has SRV record 0 100 88 samba4-1.headoffice.company.com.
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|host -t SRV _ldap._tcp.headoffice.company.com.|output=<pre>
_ldap._tcp.headoffice.company.com has SRV record 0 100 389 samba4-1.headoffice.company.com.
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|host -t A samba4-1.headoffice.company.com.|output=<pre>
samba4-1.headoffice.company.com has address 192.168.0.10
</pre>}}

==== Kerberous sub function test ====
There should not be any error prompt when your password is the administrator password on the samba AD.
{{RootCmd|kinit administrator@HEADOFFICE.COMPANY.COM|output=<pre>
Password:
</pre>}}

=== Final Setup ===
Finally we will need make the following 

{{File|/etc/conf.d/samba|Changing to samba4 deamon|<pre>
# Add "winbind" to the daemon_list if you also want winbind to start.
# Replace "smbd nmbd" by "samba4" if you want the active directory domain controller part or the ntvfs
# file server part or the rpc proxy to start.
# Note that samba4 controls 'smbd' by itself, thus it can't be started manually. You can, however,
# tweak the behaviour of a samba4-controlled smbd by modifying your '/etc/samba/smb.conf' file
# accordingly.
daemon_list="samba4"
</pre>}}

= FAQ = 
'''1. Where is all my share after the new migration?'''<br />
A: They are not being migrated together, you will have to manually move them over.<br />
However, with the help of ACL and xattrs you should kept your configurable share as simple as possible and let the files system xattrs and ACL take over the jobs.<br />
E.g.
{{Code||<pre>
[netlogon]
        path = /var/lib/samba/sysvol/headoffice.company.com/scripts
        read only = No
</pre>}}<br />
<br />



'''2. My netlogon is not working?'''<br />
A: Netlogon script setting from ldap is not being migrated when you move from samba3 PDC to Samba4.<br />
Why? You are advise to use GPO Drive mapping which in most case the deployment can be simpler.<br />
Some Example:<br />
* Map Network Shared Drive in Group Policy<ref name="Map Network Shared Drive in Group Policy">[http://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/show/17039-mapping-drives-with-group-policy-preferences-and-item-level-targeting Map Network Shared Drive in Group Policy]</ref><br />
* Using Group Policy Preferences to Map Drives Based on Group Membership<ref name="Using Group Policy Preferences to Map Drives Based on Group Membership">[http://blogs.technet.com/b/askds/archive/2009/01/07/using-group-policy-preferences-to-map-drives-based-on-group-membership.aspx?PageIndex=2 Using Group Policy Preferences to Map Drives Based on Group Membership]</ref><br />
* Windows XP Drive Maps GPO not working<ref name="Windows XP Drive Maps GPO not working">[http://www.kevintaber.com/2012/04/05/windows-xp-drive-maps-gpo-not-working/ Windows XP Drive Maps GPO not working]</ref>

But still if you still want to use netlogon script, you can copy all your existing script to the [netlogon] path above.<br />
{{Note|Make change of your netbios name in your netlogon script if you have change it during the migration.}}

Open the AD Users profiles under setting and put the script file name in (without path). <br />
e.g: netlog.bat<br />
You can do it for all users by selection all together.<br />
<br />



'''3. My [homes] is not accessible, I have not change anythings.'''<br />
A: a basic [homes] share can be as simple as below.

{{Code||<pre>
[homes]
        valid users = %S
        read only = No
        browseable = No
</pre>}}

However something is missing, how would the system know your home path?<br />
By default uses path is read by /etc/nsswitch.conf but as you know our user information are in Samba AD so we can only ready it by using winbind.<br />
You would have to configure /etc/nsswitch.conf and add winbind to be like follow <br />

{{Code|/etc/nsswitch.conf|<pre>
passwd:      compat winbind
shadow:      compat 
group:       compat winbind
</pre>}}

{{Note|shadow with winbind, that would be a nice to have. In this case will not need to configure pam to use winbind since shadow information is already provided. But provided AD can support shadow password}}
For more about PAM support winbind, please check on the docs below.
<ref name="Samba4/Winbind">[https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/Winbind Samba4/Winbind]</ref>

With this configuration the system will be able to know the user and group, use these to verify:
{{RootCmd
|getent passwd
|getent group
}}

You would see some strange entry on the password where the path are /home/COMPANY/username
which is the caused of why your [homes] don't work.
So just tweak smb.conf a bit on winbind under [global] but before any share
{{Code|/etc/samba/smb.conf|<pre>
        winbind use default domain = Yes
        template homedir = /home/%ACCOUNTNAME%
        template shell = /bin/bash
</pre>}}

Restart Samba and run the above command again...

{{Warning|nscd have to be off when you use winbind, as winbind have it own cache and thus caused nscd to be even more delay}}
