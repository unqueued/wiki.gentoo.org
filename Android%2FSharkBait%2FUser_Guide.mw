This article is intended for devices that are supported by [http://www.shark-bait.org SharkBait]. The current list of supported devices is as follows:

* Huawei Nexus 6P ({{c|angler}})

If your device is not in the list, consult the [[User:Jsteward/SharkBait Porter's Guide|Porter's Guide]] for instructions on how to add support for a device. The rest of this article assumes that you have a device that's supported. Let's get started!

__TOC__

== Install a normal Android system ==

The first step is to install a normal version of Android on your device. Note that the system should have ADB root access (i.e. ability to {{c|adb root}} and get {{c|adbd}} running as root). [https://lineageos.org/ Lineage OS] should be a good choice in many cases.

== Flash boot.img to disable full-disk encryption ==

The supported devices have corresponding pages that contain links to scripts that modifies the {{c|boot.img}} extracted from the device to disable forced encryption. Clone [https://github.com/KireinaHoro/sharkbait-setup the SharkBait Setup repository] to your work computer and do the following.

{{Warning|The following steps wipe your device's {{c|userdata}} and {{c|cache}} partition (a.k.a. &quot;factory reset&quot;). Make sure that important data is backed up before continuing.}}

{{Cmd|cd sharkbait-setup|DEVICE=angler # substitute with your device name|sudo ./decrypt.sh $DEVICE}}
After the device has boot up, verify that the following command doesn't output anything, which indicates that forced encryption has been disabled:

{{Cmd|adb shell mount {{!}} grep "/dev/block/dm-"}}
== Setup Gentoo chroot in /data/gnu ==

Gain root access via adb. Make path <code>/data/gnu</code>; this will be the home of Gentoo root, which will become the system root soon. Follow [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Stage|Guide on Gentoo Wiki]] to set up the Gentoo root. Note the following points during the setup:

* Pick {{c|arm64}} stage3 tarballs that can be found [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/experimental/arm64/ here] instead of AMD64 stage3 tarballs;
* Add user {{c|portage}} to gid 3003 ({{c|inet}}):
** {{RootCmd|groupadd -g 3003 inet &amp;&amp; gpasswd -a portage inet}}
* Install [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/android.git/ the proj/android.git overlay] that contains Android-specific kernel sources and utilities. Refer to [[Layman]] for how to add an overlay to the system.
* Choose {{c|sys-kernel/${BOARD_NAME}-sources}} instead of the general {{c|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} when picking the kernel source. Install {{c|virtual/android-sources}} for packages that want the {{c|virtual/linux-sources}} virtual. Also, install {{c|sys-kernel/linux-headers}} with exactly the same version as the sources from the overlay.
* Install {{c|sys-kernel/installkernel}} for automatic deploying boot.img on Android.
** Read post-installation message carefully.
* Configure the kernel as the following:
** Some kernels require a specific version of compiler. Try using an older version of compiler if problems occur (e.g. compile errors, unable to boot, etc.)
** {{RootCmd|make sharkbait_${BOARD_NAME}_defconfig}}
** change the kernel config according to your needs
** try your best to config as builtin instead of modules due to poor module dependency system in Android kernel source
** {{c|unset TMPDIR}} before {{c|make}}: adb has strange environment variables that breaks build
** '''skip the installation of kernel''' ('''do not''' {{c|make install}} yet -- {{c|sharkbait-deploy}} needs the current boot.img to deploy Android container)
* Skip configuring the bootloader

We need LXC to run Android in a container. The kernel sources of supported devices have necessary LXC options enabled by default. Install {{c|sys-apps/sharkbait-setup}} and do the following:

{{RootCmd|DEVICE=angler # substitute with your device name|sharkbait-deploy $DEVICE}}
== Install the kernel ==

Now go to <code>/usr/src/linux</code> and install the kernel:

{{RootCmd|cd /usr/src/linux|make modules_install && make install}}
== Reboot and test! ==

The genuine test for installing an operating system is rebooting and see if things work out as expected. Reboot the phone the Android way: select &quot;Reboot&quot; in the power menu. The phone should boot up normally. To go back into Gentoo, &quot;dial home&quot; via the shell script installed at {{c|/data/ssh/dialhome}}:

{{Cmd|adb shell}}
{{Cmd|prompt=adb $|/data/ssh/dialhome}}
