The following will auto-start [[OpenVPN|openvpn]] upon boot:

# Buy a subscription and log in
# {{RootCmd|echo "net-vpn/openvpn passwordsave examples" >> /etc/portage/package.use # optional}}
# {{Emerge|openvpn}}
# Go to https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-control-panel and locate the "PPTP/L2TP/SOCKS Username and Password"
# Generate Username/Password if they are not there
# In the next step, replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with the located or generated ones. {{RootCmd|cd /etc/openvpn|echo "USERNAME" >> login.conf|echo "PASSWORD" >> login.conf}}
# Download the privateinternetaccess configurations and certificates. {{RootCmd|mkdir -p pia|cd pia|wget https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/openvpn/openvpn.zip|unzip openvpn.zip|cp US\ East.ovpn ../openvpn.conf # replace with your desired region|cd ..|ln -s pia/ca.rsa.2048.crt|ln -s pia/crl.rsa.2048.pem}}
# Modify the configuration file and permissions. {{RootCmd|echo "auth-nocache" >> openvpn.conf|echo "auth-user-pass login.conf" >> openvpn.conf|chmod 600 openvpn.conf login.conf pia/*|chmod 700 pia}}
# Start the service and add to default runlevel. {{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/openvpn start|rc-update add openvpn # don't use this line if you don't want openvpn upon boot}}

If [[OpenVPN|Openvpn]] doesn't connect you would want to add www.privateinternetaccess.com's DNS servers to your {{Path|/etc/resolv.conf.head}} file.
Create '/etc/resolv.conf.head' file if it doesn't already exist, edit the file by adding the two DNS servers: 
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/resolv.conf.head|
nameserver 209.222.18.222
nameserver 209.222.18.218}}
Go to www.privateinternetaccess.com's to make sure you entered the correct DNS servers:
* Click on 'Client Support Tab' and scroll down to 'DNS leak protection' section 
Save and Reboot.
