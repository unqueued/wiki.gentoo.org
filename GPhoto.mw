'''''gPhoto''' is a set of software applications and libraries for use in digital photography. gPhoto supports not just retrieving of images from camera devices, but also upload and remote controlled configuration and capture, depending on whether the camera supports those features.'' - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

== Installation ==

gPhoto support can be enabled system-wide by setting the <var>USE</var> variable to <code>gphoto2</code>.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="gphoto2"
}}

Enabling gPhoto support will pull in the {{Package|media-libs/libgphoto2}} package, which has the following USE flags:
{{USEflag|package=media-libs/libgphoto2}}

The system needs to be updated if the <var>USE</var> variable was set to <code>gphoto2</code>.

{{Emerge|gphoto2}}

To import images from a camera, plug it in, change to the image import directory, and run:
{{Cmd|gphoto2 -p}}
