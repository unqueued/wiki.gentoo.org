'''''gPhoto''' is a set of software applications and libraries for use in digital photography. gPhoto supports not just retrieving of images from camera devices, but also upload and remote controlled configuration and capture, depending on whether the camera supports those features.'' - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

== Installation ==
Portage knows the global USE flag ''gphoto2'' for enabling support for gPhoto in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|media-libs/libgphoto2}} automatically:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="... gphoto2 ..."
}}
The USE flags of lm_sensors are:
{{USEflag
|doc
|examples
|exif+yes
|gd
|jpeg+yes
|nls+yes
|zeroconf
|CAMERAS+++Enable support for your camera. Enabel in your {{Path|make.conf}}.
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

You may want to also install {{Package|media-gfx/gphoto2}}, if it isn't already pulled in:
{{Emerge|gphoto2}}

== Usage ==
To import images from your camera, plug in your camera, go to the directory you want to import the images to, and use gphoto2:
{{Cmd|gphoto2 -p}}
