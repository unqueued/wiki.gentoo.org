* External storages such as Dropbox, GoogleDrive, or Amazon S3 can be mounted to an OwnCloud installation;
* Customizable with one-click application install;
* Logging Module: supports logging of file-related actions, logs, who accessed what, when and from where. Only available OwnCloud Business, Enterprise and Education Editions.

== Requirements ==

The following will be needed in order for Owncloud to function properly: 

* A web server - ([[Apache]], [[Lighttpd]] or [[Nginx]]);
* webapp-config - ({{Package|app-admin/webapp-config}}) to easily install Owncloud Server to an vhost directory;
* PHP 5.4.9 or greater - for owncloud-5.0.13-r1 and up.

== Building and Installation ==

If <code>vhosts</code> USE will be enabled, so do before the install. The following is a list of possible USE flags.
{{USEflag|package=www-apps/owncloud
|curl+yes
|mysql
|postgres
|sqlite+yes
|vhosts
}}

Install OwnCloud:

{{emerge|www-apps/owncloud}}

=== Installing Owncloud server in the vhost directory via webapp-config ===

Requires the package <tt>webapp-config</tt> command ({{Package|app-admin/webapp-config}}):

If <code>vhosts</code> USE is enabled, this command will install the Owncloud server version 5.0.13-r1 for the domain <code>myDomain.com</code> to the directory {{Path|cloud}} which will (normally) be located in {{Path|/var/www/myDomain.com/htdocs/}}

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -h myDomain.com -d cloud -I owncloud 5.0.13-r1}}

Make sure that this directory is added as a vhosts directory.

=== Updating Owncloud server in the vhost directory via webapp-config ===

This command will update the installed Owncloud server which is located in the directory {{Path|cloud}} to the version 5.0.14

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -h myDomain.com -d cloud -U owncloud 5.0.14}}

=== Removing Owncloud server from the vhost directory via webapp-config ===

This command will remove the installed Owncloud server version 5.0.14 which is located in the directory {{Path|cloud}}.

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -C -h myDomain.com -d cloud owncloud 5.0.14}}

== Performance Tweaks == 

==== Activate Owncloud Cronjobs ([http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/admin_manual/configuration/background_jobs.html#cron-jobs for more information]):====
{{RootCmd|crontab -u apache -e}}
  */15  *  *  *  * php -f /var/www/mydomain.com/htdocs/cloud/cron.php

==== Enable APCu ====

{{RootCmd|PHP_TARGETS{{=}}"php5-4" emerge -av dev-php/pecl-apcu}}

Then restart the php-fpm service:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/php-fpm restart}}

To verify if apc is working, copy {{Path|apc.php}} in the {{Path|www}} folder
{{RootCmd|cp /usr/share/php/apc/apc.php /var/www/}}

Open it with a preferred web browser.

==== Enable MEMCACHED ====

== Owncloud client ==
