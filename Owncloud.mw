== Requirements ==

The following will be needed in order for Owncloud to function properly: 

* A web server - ([[Apache]], [[Lighttpd]] or [[Nginx]]);
* webapp-config - ({{Package|app-admin/webapp-config}}) to easily install Owncloud Server to an vhost directory;
* PHP 5.4.9 or greater - for owncloud-5.0.13-r1

== Building and Installation ==

If <code>vhosts</code> USE will be enabled, so do before the install. The following is a list of possible USE flags.
{{USEflag|package=www-apps/owncloud
|curl
|mysql
|postgres
|sqlite
|vhosts
}}

Install OwnCloud:

{{emerge|www-apps/owncloud}}

=== Installing Owncloud server in the vhost directory via webapp-config ===

Requires the package <tt>webapp-config</tt> command ({{Package|app-admin/webapp-config}}):

If you have the <code>vhosts</code> USE is enabled, this command will install the Owncloud server version 5.0.13-r1 for the domain <code>myDomain.com</code> to in directory {{Path|cloud}} which will (normally) be located in {{Path|/var/www/myDomain.com/htdocs/}}

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -I -h myDomain.com -d cloud owncloud 5.0.13-r1}}

Make sure that this directory is added as a vhosts directory.

=== Updating Owncloud server in the vhost directory via webapp-config ===

This command will update the installed Owncloud server which is located in the directory {{Path|cloud}} to the version 5.0.14

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -U -h myDomain.com -d cloud owncloud 5.0.14}}

=== Removing Owncloud server from your vhost directory via webapp-config ===

This command will remove the installed Owncloud server version 5.0.14 which is located in the directory {{Path|cloud}}.

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -C -h myDomain.com -d cloud owncloud 5.0.14}}
