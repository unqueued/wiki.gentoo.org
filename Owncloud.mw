* Firefox Sync/Mozilla Sync hosting — Mozilla Firefox users can store all history, form data, bookmarks etc. in an ownCloud server;
* External storages such as Dropbox, GoogleDrive, or Amazon S3 can be mounted to an ownCloud installation;
* Customizable with one-click application install;
* Logging Module: supports logging of file-related actions, logs, who accessed what, when and from where. Only available ownCloud Business, Enterprise and Education Editions.

== Requirements ==

The following will be needed in order for ownCloud to function properly: 

* A web server - ([[Apache]], [[Lighttpd]] or [[Nginx]]);
* webapp-config - ({{Package|app-admin/webapp-config}}) to easily install ownCloud Server to an vhost directory;
* PHP 5.4.9 or greater - for owncloud-5.0.13-r1 and up.

== Building and Installation ==

If <code>vhosts</code> USE will be enabled, so do before the install. The following is a list of possible USE flags.

{{USEflag|package=www-apps/owncloud}}

Install ownCloud:

{{emerge|www-apps/owncloud}}

=== Installing ownCloud server in the vhost directory via webapp-config ===

Requires the package <tt>webapp-config</tt> command ({{Package|app-admin/webapp-config}}):

If <code>vhosts</code> USE is enabled, this command will install the ownCloud server version 5.0.13-r1 for the domain <code>myDomain.com</code> to the directory {{Path|cloud}} which will (normally) be located in {{Path|/var/www/myDomain.com/htdocs/}}

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -h myDomain.com -d cloud -I owncloud 5.0.13-r1}}

Make sure that this directory is added as a vhosts directory.

=== Updating ownCloud server in the vhost directory via webapp-config ===

This command will update the installed ownCloud server which is located in the directory {{Path|cloud}} to the version 5.0.14

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -h myDomain.com -d cloud -U owncloud 5.0.14}}

=== Removing ownCloud server from the vhost directory via webapp-config ===

This command will remove the installed ownCloud server version 5.0.14 which is located in the directory {{Path|cloud}}.

{{RootCmd|webapp-config -h myDomain.com -d cloud -C owncloud 5.0.14}}

== Performance Tweaks == 

==== Activate ownCloud Cronjobs ([http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/admin_manual/configuration/background_jobs.html#cron-jobs for more information]):====
{{RootCmd|crontab -u apache -e}}
  */15  *  *  *  * php -f /var/www/mydomain.com/htdocs/cloud/cron.php

==== Enable APCu ====

{{RootCmd|PHP_TARGETS{{=}}"php5-4" emerge -av dev-php/pecl-apcu}}

Then restart the php-fpm service:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/php-fpm restart}}

To verify if apc is working, copy {{Path|apc.php}} in the {{Path|www}} folder
{{RootCmd|cp /usr/share/php/apc/apc.php /var/www/}}

Open it with a preferred web browser.

==== Enable MEMCACHED ====

== ownCloud client ==
Install the client by emerging the following package:
{{emerge|net-misc/owncloud-client}}
