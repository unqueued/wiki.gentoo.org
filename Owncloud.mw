Requires the package {{Package|app-admin/webapp-config}}:

If you have the vhosts USE flag enabled, than you can run:
{{RootCmd|webapp-config -I -h myDomain.com -d cloud owncloud 5.0.13-r1}}

to install the Owncloud server version 5.0.13-r1 for the domain <code>myDomain.com</code> to the directory {{Path|cloud}} which is normally located in {{Path|/var/www/myDomain.com/htdocs/}}

Make sure that this directory is added as a vhosts directory.

=== Updating Owncloud server in your vhost directory via webapp-config ===
{{RootCmd|webapp-config -U -h myDomain.com -d cloud owncloud 5.0.14}}
This command will update the installed Owncloud server which is located in the directory {{Path|cloud}} to the version 5.0.14.
