Udevil is a small auto-mount utility created to be a "a hassle-free replacement for udisks."<ref>http://ignorantguru.github.io/udevil/</ref> It can be used ''with'' or ''without'' [[systemd]], [[ConsoleKit]], policykit, [[D-Bus]], udisks, gvfs and [[FUSE]].<ref>http://ignorantguru.github.io/udevil/</ref>

{{Note|It is important to know Udevil does not play nicely with encrypted filesystems. If an encrypted filesystem is being used consider looking for an alternate auto-mount utility.}}

__TOC__

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===

Kernel eventpolling may need to be enabled for device media to be properly detected by the kernel:

{{KernelBox|title=Enable eventpolling (CONFIG_EPOLL)|1=<pre>
General setup  --->
   [*] Configure standard kernel features (expert users)  --->
      [*]   Enable eventpoll support
</pre>}}

After enabling eventpolling confirm operation by running:

{{RootCmd
|cat /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs
|cat /sys/block/sr0/events_poll_msecs
}}

If either command returns 0 or -1 then there will be issues detecting device media. Create a small script in {{Path|[[local.d|/etc/local.d]]}} that will force event polling for each device:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/eventpolling.start|title=Enable event polling|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/bash
source /etc/profile
echo 2000 > /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs
echo 2000 > /sys/block/sr0/events_poll_msecs
}}

Be sure to make the script executable:

{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/local.d/eventpolling.start}}

=== Emerge ===

Install Udevil:

{{Emerge|sys-apps/udevil}}

== Configuration ==

=== Global ===

Udevil's operation can be configured using the global configuration file:

* {{Path|/etc/udevil/udevil.conf}}

=== Local ===

According to official documentation<ref>http://ignorantguru.github.io/udevil/udevil.conf.txt</ref> it is possible to configure auto-mount permissions on an individual basis by creating an {{Path|/etc/udevil/}} configuration file in this following format:

* {{Path|/etc/udevil/udevil-user-USERNAME.conf}}

Where <code>USERNAME</code> is replaced by the user's user name.

=== devmon ===

A configuration file called {{Path|devmon}} is also installed in the {{Path|/etc}}.

* {{Path|/etc/conf.d/devmon}}

== Usage ==

=== Daemon mode ===

==== OpenRC ====

Udevil can be configured to operate as a daemon by calling the <tt>devmon</tt> command. It is possible to run this command in the background by calling it as a job using the ampersand (<code>&</code>). Users can add the following line to their {{Path|~/.bashrc}} file which will start <tt>devmon</tt> as a daemon each time the system boots:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.bashrc|title=Starting devmon in daemon mode|1=
devmon 2>&1 > /dev/null &
}}

==== Systemd ====

To start devmon as a systemd service:

{{RootCmd|systemctl start devmon@<user>}}

=== Invocation ===

{{Cmd|udevil mount <device>}}

{{Cmd|udevil unmount <device>}}
