Udevil is a small auto-mount utility created to be a "a hassle-free replacement for udisks."<ref>http://ignorantguru.github.io/udevil/</ref> Udevil can be used ''with'' or ''without'' without [[systemd]], [[ConsoleKit]], policykit, [[dbus]], udisks, gvfs and [[FUSE]].<ref>http://ignorantguru.github.io/udevil/</ref>

{{Note|It is important to know Udevil does not play nicely with encrypted filesystems. If an encrypted filesystem is used on the system consider looking into another auto-mount utility.}}
