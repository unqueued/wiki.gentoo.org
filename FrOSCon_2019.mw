=== Gentoo stand ===
Gentoo will have a stand as soon as we have enough volunteers, who maintain the stand.
The conference team provides 1 table, 2 chairs and port on a network switch for us.

=== Gentoo talks ===
Talks can be either in German or English language. The first language of most (perhaps 90%) visitors is German, but nearly everybody understands English very well too. There is an increasing number of international guests and also some English talks every year.

====Brainstorming====
Ideas for talks:
* Gentoo installation (live?)
* How to write Ebuilds
* QA
* EAPI 10 
* Contributing to Gentoo
* Gentoo Security
