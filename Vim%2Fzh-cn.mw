{{Metadata|abstract=Vim是一个基于vi文本编辑器的文本编辑器。它可以从命令行使用，也可以作为具有图形用户界面的独立应用程序使用。}}

'''Vim''' ('''V'''i '''im'''proved) is a text editor based on the {{c|[[Wikipedia:Vi|vi]]}} text editor. It can be used from the command-line or as a standalone application with a graphical user interface.

== 安装 ==

=== USE 标记 ===

{{USEflag|package=app-editors/vim}}

=== Emerge ===

如果不需要X Window System支持，请安装{{Package|app-editors/vim}}:

{{Emerge|app-editors/vim}}

附加软件

==== Gvim ====

To install Vim with both the ncurses-based interface ({{Path|/usr/bin/vim}}) as well as the graphical interface (for the X Window System - {{Path|/usr/bin/gvim}}), install the {{Package|app-editors/gvim}} package:

{{Emerge|app-editors/gvim}}

==== Vim-qt ====

There is also an experimental [[Qt]] interface called {{Package|app-editors/vim-qt}} which can also be installed.

==== 插件 ====

“app-vim”类别提供了大量额外的语法定义，插件和其他Vim相关的东西。

Use {{c|emerge}} or {{c|eix}} to get an overview of available packages in the ''app-vim'' category:

{{Cmd|emerge --search "%@^app-vim"
|eix -cC app-vim}}

== 配置 ==

=== Files ===

Vim can be configured on a per-user basis or through a system-wide configuration file:

* {{Path|/etc/vim/vimrc}} - The system wide (global) settings file.
* {{Path|~/.vimrc}} - The user-specific (local) configuration file. The tilde (~) means it is in the user's home directory.

== Usage ==

=== Getting started ===

Vim has a built-in tutorial which should require around 30 min to go through. Start it using the {{c|vimtutor}} command:

{{Cmd|vimtutor}}

=== Tips and tricks ===

==== Using Vim like ex or ed from the command line ====

It is possible to use Vim for one-liners — commands that can be used in scripts or on the command line to make changes in an unattended manner.

For instance, the following command adds <code>#</code> to the beginning of each line in the {{Path|file.txt}} file:

{{Cmd|vim -c ":%s/^/#/g" -c ":x" file.txt}}

What happens is that Vim interprets the passed on commands (through the <code>-c</code> option). The first command is Vim's substitution command (which is very similar to {{c|sed}}'s), the second one is Vim's instruction to save and exit the editor.

=== Change file encoding ===

To change the file encoding of a file to [[UTF-8]], use the following command (in Vim command mode):

{{Cmd|e ++enc{{=}}utf8|prompt=:|color=orange}}

As shown in the previous trick, it is possible to do this from the command line as well:

{{Cmd|vim -c ":wq! ++enc{{=}}utf8" file.txt}}
