There are currently three ways to get Netflix using Gentoo:
;[[#Using_Chromium|1. Using the Chromium web browser]]:Uses the newer HTML5 approach in an open source software browser.
;[[#Using_Google_Chrome|2. Using the Google Chrome web browser]]:Uses the newer HTML5 approach, but ''at this time'' requires the use of ''this'' particular, binary-only browser.
;[[Netflix/Pipelight|3. Using Pipelight]]:A little more difficult to setup than the two choices above. Uses the Silverlight status quo. The advantage to this approach is that Silverlight is slightly more robust and versatile; viewing Netflix is not limited to one browser.

== Using Chromium ==

Enable the <code>widevine</code> USE flag for {{Package|www-client/chromium}}, as well as {{Package|www-plugins/chrome-binary-plugins}} in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}}. This can be done in one shot using the following command:

{{rootCmd|<nowiki>echo -e 'www-plugins/chrome-binary-plugins widevine\nwww-client/chromium widevine' >> /etc/portage/package.use</nowiki>}}

Next <tt>emerge</tt> the packages:

{{rootCmd|<nowiki>emerge www-plugins/chrome-binary-plugins www-client/chromium</nowiki>}}

Start up Chromium and head to https://www.netflix.com, Netflix should work flawlessly!

== Using Google Chrome ==

Emerge Google Chrome:
{{rootCmd|emerge -atv google-chrome}}

=== Troubleshooting ===

In Netflix settings navigate to: {{Path|Your Account}} → {{Path|Your Profile}} → {{Path|Playback Settings}}, ensure that "{{Path|Prefer HTML5 player instead of Silverlight}}" is checked (it should be by default; just verify).

== Using Pipelight ==

See the [[Netflix/Pipelight|Pipelight article]].
