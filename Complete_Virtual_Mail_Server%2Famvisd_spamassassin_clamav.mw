== Introduction ==
Spam is becoming more and more of an issue on the internet and a robust and solid solution is required. There are payed services for even more spam protection but should not be required and will not be discussed in this article.

== Postfix ==
The first line of defense, is postfix itself. Postfix offers a few basic means to block spam, or rather spammers. Using ''smtpd_client_restrictions'' it is possible to use public DNS blacklists. There are 3 popular DNS blacklists of which one is incorporated into the other. These two lists are also the [http://www.intra2net.com/en/support/antispam/ most accurate] ones. The most important one is [http://zen.spamhaus.org zen.spamhaus.org] and as a backup [http://bl.spamcop.net bl.spamcop.net] can be used. Using them with postfix is very simple. Add these domains as ''reject_rbl_client'' in {{Path|main.cf}}.
{{File|/etc/postfix/main.cf|Use DNS blacklists|<pre>
# Block spam using DNS blacklists
smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, reject_rbl_client zen.spamhaus.org, reject_rbl_client bl.spamcop.net
</pre>}}
{{Note|''permit_mynetworks'' and ''permit_sasl_authenticated'' are added for good measure. If other restrictions are required or already in use, keep them in place.}}

== Amavis ==

=== Introduction ===
Spam-assassin and ClamAV are the tools to block spam and virusses, however amavis is required to tie this all together. Amavis will actually behave as a mailserver in itself, accept mail, filter it, and send it onwards again. For this to work, postfix will need to actually listen for mail twice. The default port 25 is where mail initially is received on. From there on it is sent to amavis, which will be listening on port 10024. When amavis is done with the message, it will be sent to postfix on a different port, 10027. The reason for this should be obvious. If mail would be offered again on port 25, it would be passed to amavis again and thus in an endless loop. Obviously, postfix on port 10027 would only be listening to known hosts, like ''localhost'' and not check for spam anymore.
{{Note|Because of this setup, it is quite easily possible, to have these 3 mail 'handlers' on 3 different hosts. It could be possible to have the primary mailserver, that listens on port 25 on the firewall, have it forward to a safe isolated server running only amavis and have amavis sent mail to an internal postfix server where it delivers mail to the mail storage.}}

=== Installation ===
Amavis should have been installed already, if not, emerge it. This should pull in spam-assassin and clamav as its dependancies.
{{Emerge|mail-filter/amavisd-new}}

=== Basic Configuration ===
Amavisd offers an enormous amount of options and going over all them will take some time. The configuration file {{Path|/etc/amavisd.conf}} however is well documented and divided into clear sections. Each section will be examined as needed. Only options that will be changed will be mentioned to cut down the text for readability.
{{Note|The configuration file is actually perl code and proper precautions should be taken when editing this file.}}

For this example amavisd will be running on host foo but this could be any other host as well, amavisd does not require to run on the same host as postfix. Also the domain used is only used to identify the server itself with, not the domains amavisd will be scanning.
{{Note|With amavis being quite complex, troubleshooting can be difficult enough as it is.}}

The first step, is to disable all actual checks and to enable logging. Also some default values should be setup.

{{File|/etc/amavisd.conf|Disable anti-spam, enable logging|<pre>
@bypass_virus_checks_maps = (1);  # controls running of anti-virus code
@bypass_spam_checks_maps  = (1);  # controls running of anti-spam code
# $bypass_decode_parts = 1;         # controls running of decoders&dearchivers

$mydomain = 'example.com';
$myhostname = 'foo.example.com';

$log_level = 5;              # verbosity 0..5, -d
</pre>}}

{{Note|''virusalert@example.com'' and ''spam.police@example'' can be renamed to ''undef'' if not wanting to receive any information on breaches. If not, these e-mail addresses should exist.}}

Normally restarting postfix should restart aswell, for now, only amavisd should be started to see if there are any initial problems.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/amavisd start}}

=== Linking amavisd to Postfix ===
With amavisd working in bare skeletal mode, it should theoretically just pass mail through. Perfect for testing the postfix -> amavisd -> postfix binding.

First, a second postfix transport, where amavis will inject its mail, is added. A lot of options are defaulted to empty, since either they have been checked already, or interfere otherwise.
{{File|/etc/postfix/master.cf|Filter mail through amavisd|<pre>
localhost:10027 inet n  -       n       -       2       smtpd
  -o disable_dns_lookup=yes
  -o content_filter=
  -o myhostname=foo.example.com
  -o local_recipient_maps=
  -o relay_recipient_maps=
  -o smtpd_restriction_classes=
  -o smtpd_client_restrictions=
  -o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
  -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=
  -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
  -o mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8
  -o strict_rfc821_envelopes=yes
  -o smtpd_error_sleep_time=0
  -o smtpd_soft_error_limit=1001
  -o smtpd_hard_error_limit=1000
  -o smtpd_client_connection_count_limit=0
  -o smtpd_client_connection_rate_limit=0
  -o receive_override_options=no_unknown_recipient_checks,no_header_body_checks
  -o smtpd_authorized_xforward_hosts=127.0.0.0/8
</pre>}}
With this transport in place, it should only listen on localhost and only accept mail from localhost. This should be extended if amavis is run elsewhere, but keep in mind anything is accepted.
{{Note|''maxproc' is set to '''2''' above. This can be increased if more listening daemons are requried. However this number needs to match amavis's ''$max_servers''.}}

Next another transport is added for, which could be considers 'being' amavis in a sense.

{{File|/etc/postfix/master.cf|amavis transport|<pre>
amavis    unix  -       -       n       -       2       lmtp
  -o disable_dns_lookups=yes
  -o lmtp_send_xforward_command=yes
  -o lmtp_data_done_timeout=1200
</pre>}}

After the transport for amavis has been added, smtp should be told to route all mail through amavis. For this two option need to be added to smtpd and change the maxproc to match amavis's.
{{File|/etc/postfix/master.cf|relay to amavis|<pre>
smtp       inet  n       -       n       -       2       smtpd
  -o content_filter=amavis:[127.0.0.1]:10024
  -o receive_override_options=no_address_mappings
smtps     inet  n       -       n       -       2       smtpd
  -o smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes
  -o content_filter=amavis:[127.0.0.1]:10024
  -o receive_override_options=no_address_mappings
</pre>}}

Restarting both amavisd and postfix then should pass all mail through amavisd.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/amavisd restart|/etc/init.d/postfix restart}}

=== Testing ===
Sending a message to ''testuser@example.com'' remotely and locally should work fine. After the message has arrived, the headers should be checked.
{{Note|When doing this test, either use webmail or a remote client using a different mailserver or mail through port 25 or 465. Do not test using mail submission on port 587 as that bypasses amavisd.}}

Looking at the mail headers, it should be noticed that it was sent through amavisd and re-deliverd to postfix.
{{Code|Mail header|<pre>
Received: from localhost (localhost [127.0.0.1])
    by foo.example.com (Postfix) with ESMTP id 03ABA22E4C
    for <testuser@example.com>; Wed, 28 Dec 2011 11:41:05 +0100 (CET)
Received: from foo.example.com ([127.0.0.1])
    by localhost (foo.example.com [127.0.0.1]) (amavisd-new, port 10024)
    with LMTP id 6N9l4nIQa620 for <testuser@example.com>; Wed, 28 Dec 2011 11:41:04 +0100 (CET)
Received: from ext.example.net (ext.example.net [1.2.3.4])
    (using TLSv1 with cipher ADH-AES256-SHA (256/256 bits))
    (No client certificate requested)
    by foo.example.com (Postfix) with ESMTPS id C136021F97
    for <testuser@example.com>; Wed, 28 Dec 2011 11:41:04 +0100 (CET)
</pre>}}
Examining the above it is clearly visible that the mail was received by postfix via SMTPS even. It was then forwarded to amavisd on port 10024 via LMTP and finally redelivered to postfix using SMTP again.

== ClamAV ==

=== Introduction ===
ClamAV is the De facto open source virus scanner for linux. Amavis can be linked to many different free and commercial virus scanners, but here clamav will be used. ClamAV is specifically designed for scanning e-mail. IT concists of two parts, clamav itself, and freshclam, the clamav updating service. By default it updates every two hours, which should be enough for anyone.

=== Installation ===
ClamAV should have been installed already, if not it should be emerged.
{{Emerge|app-antivirus/clamav}}
{{Note|The '''clamdtop'' flag lets clamav build the ''clamdtop'' utility, a nice monitoring tool for the viruscanner.}}

=== Configuration ===
ClamAV will be configured to run in daemonized mode, e.g. it will be listening for connections (from amavisd). The other option (and the default fallback in amavisd) is to have amavisd use the commandline scanner, which is much slower and much much more resource intensive.

ClamAV does not have to be run on the same host, however it is recommended for performance reasons to keep it on the same host, depending on resource usage.

To be able to communicate, clamav needs to be part of amavisd's group.
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a clamav amavis}}

It always helps to allow clamd to output some debug information.
{{File|/etc/clamd.conf|Enable Debug options|<pre>
# Enable debug messages in libclamav.
# Default: no
Debug yes
</pre>}}

Also clamd needs some settings setup in its configuration file so that amavis can talk to it.
{{File|/etc/clamd.conf|Allow amavis to conenct to clamd|<pre>
# Path to a local socket file the daemon will listen on.
# Default: disabled (must be specified by a user)
LocalSocket /var/run/clamav/clamd.sock

# Initialize supplementary group access (clamd must be started by root).
# Default: no
AllowSupplementaryGroups yes
</pre>}}
{{Note|These options appear to be the default nowadays.}}

Next starting clamd from the init scripts may produce an error message about an outdated virus database. This is normal, as the virus database has not yet been updated. Freshclam takes care of that and should be started before clamd is.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/clamd start}}

The log file can be examined for any configuration problems.
{{File|/var/log/clamav/clamd.log|ClamAV startup log|<pre>

</pre>}}
{{Note|{{Path|/var/log/clamav/freshclam.log}} can be examine for any updating problems.}}

=== Linking amavisd to clamav ===
Amavisd should connect to the socketed clamd and thus clamav needs to be enabled as one of the main antivirus scanners. The fallback of invoking clamav from the commandline should not be changed. Also the virus check bypass needs to be disabled to be effective.

{{File|/etc/amavisd.conf|Enable clamav|<pre>
# @bypass_virus_checks_maps = (1);  # controls running of anti-virus code

# ### http://www.clamav.net/
 ['ClamAV-clamd',
   \&ask_daemon, ["CONTSCAN {}\n", "/var/run/clamav/clamd.sock"],
   qr/\bOK$/m, qr/\bFOUND$/m,
   qr/^.*?: (?!Infected Archive)(.*) FOUND$/m ],
</pre>}}
{{Warning|Notice: clamd and amavisd use incompatible socket definitions by default. clamd lists ''/var/run/clamav/clamd'''.sock''''' as its socket. amavisd however wants to use ''/var/run/clamav/clamd'' as its socket. clamd's definition sounds more sane and should be used, and thus besides uncommenting the clamav section, the socket needs to be named accordingly. See {{Bug|396293}}.}}

After restarting clamd Virusses should be able to detected and blocked.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/clamd restart}}

=== Testing ===
To test whether the virus filter works, an [http://www.eicar.org/86-0-Intended-use.html anti-malware testfile] exists, sending an e-mail using this string should trigger the virus scanner.
{{Code|EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRuS-TEST-FILE|<pre>
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
</pre>}}
{{Note|Again, it should be ensured that this is message is passed through the sending mailserver, and only be blocked by the receiving server (foo.example.com). Using a client that connects to port 25 and is allowed to relay should suffice.}}

Looking at the mail.log file, the following should be revealed.
{{File|/var/log/mail.log|Virus infection test|<pre>

</pre>}}

In theory, the virus scanner should be fully functional now.

== Spam Assassin ==

=== Introduction ===
Spam Assassin is an excellent spam filter. It has become quite complex throughout the years and requires some effort to configure correctly. Spam Assassin called from within amavisd to check e-mail for its spam value.

=== Installation ===
There really should be no need to install spamassassin separately. The '''spamassassin''' useflag should have pulled it in as a dependency of amavisd-new.
{{Emerge|mail-filter/spamassassin}}

=== Configuration ===
The default configuration suffices for standard use.
{{Note|If users don't e-mail via the submission port, the ''trusted_networks'' variable should be setup properly to bypass spam filtering from known users.''}}

=== Updating ===
A key feature of Spam Assassin is its ability to self-update. Updates are handled via a so-called ''[http://updates.spamassasin.org update channel]''.

Spam Assassin comes with the '''sa-update''' tool so updates can be fully automated. Spam Assassin updates can be done by using the ''--nogpg'' flag to ignore gpg keys, but should really only be done as a last resort. Adding the spamassassin GPG key is a simple 2 step process.

{{RootCmd|wget "http://spamassassin.apache.org/updates/GPG.KEY"|sa-update --import GPG.KEY|rm GPG.KEY}}
{{Warning|Due to possible {{Bug|396307}} it is required to first create a directory for the keyring and set proper permissions prior to importing the keys.<pre>
mkdir -p /etc/spamassassin/sa-update/keys; chmod 700 /etc/spamassassin/sa-update/keys
</pre>}}

After adding the spamassassin update channel, it needs to be updated. After running this command, check for any errors.
{{RootCmd|sa-update -D}}

Once these updates have completed they need to be compiled for use with Spam Assassin. Also any errors should be spotted here.
{{RootCmd|sa-compile}}

Unlike clamav, there is no 'freshassassin' and a cronjob is required to do updates. To keep Spam Assassin up to date, a cronjob should be created for the tas.
{{File|/etc/cron.daily/sa-updates|Update Spam Assassin filter rules|<pre>
#!/bin/sh
sa-update --allowplugins --gpgkey D1C035168C1EBC08464946DA258CDB3ABDE9DC10  --channel saupdates.openprotect.com --channel updates.spamassassin.org
sa-compile
</pre>}}
Making the cronjob executable ensures it runs regularly.
{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/sa-updates}}

{{Warning|The used GPG Key here may of course change, updating and importing should fix that. For the sa-updates gpgkey Refer to [http://saupdates.openprotect.com/ OpenProtect].}}

=== Linking amavisd to Spam Assassin ===
Actually, Spam Assassin does not need to be linked to amavisd, it is an integral part of amavisd. Enabling the spamfilter in amavisd does spam filtering.

{{File|/etc/amavisd.conf|Enable Spam Assassin|<pre>
# @bypass_spam_checks_maps  = (1);  # controls running of anti-spam code
</pre>}}

And amavisd needs to be restarted.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/amavisd restart}}

=== Testing ===
Testing is done again via a client connecting to port 25 that does not have its own spamfilter. For content [http://spamassassin.apache.org/gtube/ GTUBE] can be used. On that site there is also a suitable mail message in RFC-822 format.
{{Code|Sample spam body|<pre>
XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X
</pre>}}

Checking in the testusers inbox, or junkbox more likly, the message can be found and its header examined.
{{Code|Spam Header|<pre>

    MISSING_MID=0.14, NO_DNS_FOR_FROM=0.379, TVD_SPACE_RATIO=0.001]
    autolearn=no
</pre>}}

== Finetuning Amavisd ==
Amavis has a few more settings that can be changed to do some fine-tuning.

=== Recipient delimiter ===
When using postfix with the ''recipient_delimiter'' amavisd can be told to make use of this feature.

{{File|/etc/amavisd.conf|recipient_delimiters for amavis|<pre>
# Delimiter must match the equivalent (final) MTA delimiter setting.
$recipient_delimiter = '+';		# (default is undef, i.e. disabled)
</pre>}}

=== Disperse quarantine ===
It is possible to disperse the quarantine over several sub-directories. 

For this directories need to be created first.
{{RootCmd|<pre>mkdir /var/amavis/quarantine/virus;
mkdir /var/amavis/quarantine/spam;
mkdir /var/amavis/quarantine/banned;
mkdir /var/amavis/quarantine/badh;
mkdir /var/amavis/quarantine/clean;
chown -R amavis:amavis /var/amavis/quarantine/*;
chmod -R gu+rwX /var/amavis/quarantine/*;
chmod -R o-rwx /var/amavis/quarantine/*
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/amavisd.conf|Disperse quarantine|<pre>
#$clean_quarantine_method          = 'local:clean/%m';
$virus_quarantine_method          = 'local:virus/%m';
$spam_quarantine_method           = 'local:spam/%m.gz';
$banned_files_quarantine_method   = 'local:banned/%m';
$bad_header_quarantine_method     = 'local:badh/%m';
</pre>}}

Also, setting a spam cutoff level helps in reducing stored spam. The cutoff level makes it that no spam is stored above a certain spam-score.
{{File|/etc/amavisd.conf|set a cutoff level for spam|<pre>
$sa_quarantine_cutoff_level = 25; # spam level beyond which quarantine is off
</pre>}}
{{Note|'''25''' is the default. This value, aswell as the other levels can and should be tuned to organizational needs.}}

=== Spam Delivery ===
'''$final_spam_destiny''' is by default set to ''D_PASS'', meaning that even with a high score at which it gets marked as spam, it is still deliverd to the users mailbox. Modern mail-clients, which trust Spam Assassin can then automatically move it to their SPAM folder.

== Cleanup ==
With Spam Assassin and ClamAV working as expected, debugging information can be reduced to the normal minimal.
{{File|/etc/amavisd.conf|Disable debugging in amavsd|<pre>
# Section III - Logging
# true (e.g. 1) => syslog;  false (e.g. 0) => logging to file
$DO_SYSLOG = 1;                   # (defaults to 0)

#NOTE: levels are not strictly observed and are somewhat arbitrary
$log_level = 0;		   # (defaults to 0), -d

# Turn on SpamAssassin debugging (output to STDERR, use with 'amavisd debug')
#$sa_debug = '1,all';  # defaults to false
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/clamd.conf|Disable debugging in clamav|<pre>
# Enable debug messages in libclamav.
# Default: no
#Debug yes
</pre>}}
