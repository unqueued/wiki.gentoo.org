'''FVWM-Crystal''' is an easy to use, eye-candy but also powerful desktop environment for Linux or other Unix-like operating systems. It tries to exercise [[FVWM]] quite a bit and has some interesting features unique to Linux/UNIX desktops.

== Installation==
For installing FVWM-Crystal and the needed dependencies, just issue the following command:
{{Emerge|fvwm-crystal}}

The notification area will use x11-misc/stalonetray or x11-misc/trayer. I get mitigated results with trayer. A possibility is to install both programs and to choose the one you want to use in the preferences. And when you get a personal preference, to remove the one you don't use.

For the wallpaper, FVWM-Crystal can use both x11-misc/hsetroot or media-gfx/feh. With feh, you get a fast and powerful picture viewer for the same price. With hsetroot, the installation will be faster.

It is a lot of optional programs you can install to improve your FVWM-Crystal experience:
* A file manager: FVWM-Crystal include support for any file manager with its desktop icon manager (more than 10 have built-in support, the other can be selected via custom commands). 2 file managers are supported simultaneously.
* A terminal emulator: at least one of gnome-terminal, konsole, xfce4-terminal, xterm, aterm, Eterm, mrxvt, urxvt (rxvt-unicode) or terminator.
* Quake console: at least one of mrxvt, urxwt, aterm or xterm.
* ROX-Filer (rox) or nautilus: for alternative ways to get icons on the desktop and wallpaper.
* xscreensaver - a screen saver and/or screen locking.
* sudo and optionally gksudo configured for running text/graphical applications as superuser and reboot/shutdown computer options in the menu.
* A media player: at least one of Music Player Daemon (mpc), X MultiMedia System 2 (xmms2), alsaplayer, cmus, mocp, mplayer, mplayer2, quodlibet or cdcd.
* A mixer application: at least one of aumix or alsamixer. With alsamixer, you will get true dB control.
* transset and xcompmgr for full transparency support and the Bling bling clone.
* xrandr for video mode switching
* pmount or pmount-gui for auto-mounting of removable USB and Firewire medias. You may want to install uam too. autofs is a good alternative for auto-mounting of CDROM/DVD drives.
* Xephyr (xorg-server with USE="xnest") for nested sessions.

All that imply you can have a full featured FVWM-Crystal with auto-mounting support without udisks and its dependencies.

As a minimum, I will recommend you to install the following:
{{Emerge|mc|pcmanfm|rxvt-unicode|xscreensaver|alsaplayer|mplayer|alsamixer}}

At that time, FVWM-Crystal ebuilds are missing a dependency on xdg-user-dirs. That should be fixed shortly. In the mean time, if the icons on the desktop doesn't work well, that imply you must install that software:
{{Emerge|xdg-user-dirs}}
