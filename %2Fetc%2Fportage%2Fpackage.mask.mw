{{Path|/etc/portage/package.mask}} is a file, or a directory of files, that can be used to prevent certain packages from being installed.

== Example ==

{{CodeBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.mask/example|title=Package.mask example|1=
# Mask beta versions greater than 1.79 of powertop since they have less features
>=sys-power/powertop-1.97

# Prevent MySQL from installing by masking the package (use MariaDB)
dev-db/mysql

# This system is not ready to move to Java 7; mask JDK and JRE that use Java 7.
virtual/jdk:1.7
virtual/jre:1.7
}}

== Format ==

One DEPEND atom per line; comment lines begin with a <code>#</code> (hash).

For DEPEND atom syntax, see [[version specifier]].
