== Hardware Config ==

=== Wireless ===

{{Note|1=

It may be impossible to download the distfiles needed by '''net-wireless/broadcom-sta''' before setting up the wireless. If this is the case, the best option is to download the needed files to a removable drive and copy them to <code>/usr/portage/distfiles</code>. To get the URLs for the needed files, run the following command in Gentoo:
<br />
{{ RootCmd|emerge -qpf net-wireless/broadcom-sta {{!}} less -ca }}
}}


The Broadcom BCM4352 wireless adapter requires the use of the official Broadcom driver:

{{KernelBox|title=Configuration for broadcom-sta, 4.0.5-gentoo|1=

}}

Recompile your kernel, install it, and reboot. Once rebooted, emerge broadcom-sta:

{{Emerge|net-wireless/broadcom-sta}}

Modprobe the new Broadcom module
{{RootCmd|modprobe wl}}

If all goes well, you should have a working wireless interface

=== Synaptics Touchpad ===

The touchpad runs off of an I2C bus and needs some special kernel drivers to be installed:

=== MMC/SD Card Reader ===

The MMC/SD slot is located on the right side of the laptop, next to the right USB port. It is relatively easy to use with the proper kernel config.

== Issues ==

=== Loss of horizontal sync when switching TTYs ===
A bug is present in current kernel versions that results in horizontal sync loss on Broadwell machines when switching TTYs. [https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95741] To fix it, you can add <tt>i915.enable_ips=0</tt> to your kernel command-line as a workaround.

=== GPU hang/freeze4 with external display ===
An issue appears present on QHD display models that may result in GPU hangs/freezing when manipulating the displays with xrandr on kernels 4.0 and up. Ensure i915.preliminary_hw_support=0 is set as this appears to alleviate this issue.

=== Display Blanking randomly ===
This issue appears to be related to high resolutions on both the internal display as well as 4k external displays.  Preliminary testing indicates that the i915.preliminary_hw_support=0 option being set significantly reduces or removes the issue.
