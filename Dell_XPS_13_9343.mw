<br />
* Due to the lack of CD-ROM or DVD drive on this laptop, it is generally necessary to install Gentoo using a removable drive. However, at the time of this writing, Gentoo's official [[LiveUSB]] lacks drivers needed to install using the instructions in the [[Handbook:AMD64|Gentoo handbook]]:
** USB 3 drivers - prevents booting to the live medium due to all ports being USB 3
** Proprietary Broadcom wireless drivers - needed to set up the network
* '''For these reasons, it is recommended to use a different installation medium.''' Some possible alternatives include:
** [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media Arch Linux USB]
** [http://docs.kali.org/downloading/kali-linux-live-usb-install Kali Linux USB]
** [http://www.sysresccd.org/Sysresccd-manual-en_How_to_install_SystemRescueCd_on_an_USB-stick SystemRescueCd USB]
* After successfully booting any of these mediums, you can pick the handbook back up at [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Networking|Configuring the network]]. ''Results may vary.''

== Hardware Config ==

=== USB ===
The two USB 3 ports require the xHCI driver to function with USB 3 devices and the EHCI driver to function with non-USB 3 devices. Any removable USB drive will also require USB Mass storage support.

}}

=== Wireless ===



{{Note|1=

''The Dell XPS 13 9343 does not come with a built-in NIC other than the Broadcom or Intel wireless adapter''


* It may be impossible to fetch the distfiles needed by the '''net-wireless/broadcom-sta''' package or '''sys-kernel/linux-firmware''' (for the Intel Wireless variant) while the wireless is offline. It is recommended that you emerge the broadcom-sta or linux-firmware package during Gentoo's installation, after compiling the kernel, but before rebooting.


* If you end up running a kernel without wireless support and still need to download the distfiles, you can transfer the files using a removable drive and copy them to <code>/usr/portage/distfiles</code>. To find the URLs for the needed files, run the following: <br /> <br /> {{RootCmd|emerge --fetchonly --pretend net-wireless/broadcom-sta }}
}}

The Broadcom BCM4352 wireless adapter requires the use of the official Broadcom driver. This driver is proprietary and requires that several kernel options be (un)set before installation:

{{KernelBox|title=Configuration for broadcom-sta, 4.0.5-gentoo|1=
Processor type and features  --->
    Preemption Model  --->
        Voluntary Kernel Preemption (Desktop)

    Sonics Silicon Backplane  --->
        < > Sonics Silicon Backplane support
    Broadcom Specific AMBA  --->
        < > BCMA support  
}}

After compiling the new kernel, emerge broadcom-sta:

{{Emerge|net-wireless/broadcom-sta}}

Reboot to the new kernel and make sure the new Broadcom module is loaded
{{RootCmd|modprobe wl}}

If all goes well, you should have a working wireless interface

{{RootCmd|iw list|output=<pre>

        Supported interface modes:

</pre>
}}

The configuration for the Intel adapter is similar, but no other package than linux-firmware needs to be installed:

{{KernelBox|title=Configuration for Intel, 4.2.0-gentoo-r1|1=
[*] Networking support  --->
    [*] Wireless  --->

            < >   Intel Wireless WiFi DVM Firmware support
            <M>   Intel Wireless WiFi MVM Firmware support
}}

=== Bluetooth ===

Much like the Broadcom wireless chipset, the Broadcom BCM2045A0 Bluetooth chipset also requires proprietary firmware. If you are booting the kernel using EFI stub, you will need to compile the kernel bluetooth options as modules:

{{KernelBox|title=Configuration for Intel, 4.5.6-gentoo|1=
[*] Networking support  --->
    [M] Bluetooth subsystem support  --->
        <M> RFCOMM protocol support
        <M> BNEP protocol support
        <M> HIDP protocol support
            Bluetooth device drivers  --->
                  <M> HCI USB driver
                  [*] Broadcom protocol support
                  <M> HCI SDIO driver
                  <M> HCI UART driver
                  [*] Broadcom protocol support
}}

If you try to compile the Bluetooth components into the kernel, the firmware is not available at the time the kernel loads, the firmware is not loaded and the Bluetooth system is not initialised. Compiling as a module ensures that the firmware is available at module autoload, and the system is initialised successfully.

This may be obviated if you use an initramfs, or when the firmware becomes available as part of the kernel source tree.

The Arch wiki provides information on how to downloading and extracting the firmware, and where to place it: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_13_%282016%29#Bluetooth

=== Alsa sound ===

The built-in sound card has two different components: Standard audio output and audio output using the HDMI port. It is necessary to configure ALSA so that these are loaded in the proper order.

{{KernelBox|title=Intel HD Audio, 4.0.5-gentoo|1=

}}

=== Synaptics Touchpad ===

The touchpad runs off of an I2C bus and needs some special kernel drivers to be installed:

{{KernelBox|title=i2c touchpad, 4.0.5-gentoo|1=
Device Drivers  --->
    Input device support  --->
        [*] Generic input layer (needed for keyboard, mouse, ...)

            I2C HID support  --->
                <M> HID over I2C transport layer
}}

=== MMC/SD Card Reader ===

The MMC/SD slot is located on the right side of the laptop, next to the right USB port. It is relatively easy to use with the proper kernel config.

{{KernelBox|title=Realtek PCI-E SD/MMC card interface, 4.0.5-gentoo|1=

== Issues ==

=== Loss of horizontal sync when switching TTYs ===
A bug is present in current kernel versions that results in horizontal sync loss on Broadwell machines when switching TTYs. [https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95741] To fix it, you can add <tt>i915.enable_ips=0</tt> to your kernel command-line as a workaround.

=== GPU hang/freeze4 with external display ===
An issue appears present on QHD display models that may result in GPU hangs/freezing when manipulating the displays with xrandr on kernels 4.0 and up. Ensure i915.preliminary_hw_support=0 is set as this appears to alleviate this issue.

=== Display Blanking randomly ===
This issue appears to be related to high resolutions on both the internal display as well as 4k external displays.  Preliminary testing indicates that the i915.preliminary_hw_support=0 option being set significantly reduces or removes the issue.
