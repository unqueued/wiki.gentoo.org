'''Project Sunrise''' (also known as the '''Sunrise Overlay''') used to provide a user-maintained overlay of good quality packages not in the Gentoo ebuild repository. The project has been discontinued; this page serves as a memorial for it.

== Alternatives to Sunrise ==

Sunrise was mostly superseded by the [[Project:Proxy Maintainers|Proxy Maintainers]] project which allows users to maintain packages directly in the Gentoo repository.

== Resources of Sunrise project ==

The [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/sunrise.git/ Sunrise project repository] is kept open for use of users and developers. It still holds a few packages that are not in Gentoo. However, please note that those packages are usually outdated and may not work at all. The ebuilds mostly serve as a base for users who wish to take them over and maintain their own versions.
