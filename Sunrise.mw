As of June, 2016 this project has been '''discontinued''' (see [https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-project/message/df16291a26bbc5c3a219ab26fc7bac99 this announcement]).

'''Project Sunrise''' (also known as the '''Sunrise Overlay''') used to provide a user-maintained overlay of good-quality packages not in the Gentoo ebuild repository. This page serves as a memorial for it.

== Alternatives to Sunrise ==

Sunrise was mostly superseded by the [[Project:Proxy Maintainers|Proxy Maintainers]] project which allows users to maintain packages directly in the Gentoo repository. If you'd like to submit new packages, or revive some packages from Sunrise, please see the [[Project:Proxy_Maintainers/User_Guide|proxy-maint user guide]].

It is also possible to maintain the packages in your own repository. There were a few repositories with the purpose of collecting various 'beta-quality' packages with more or less open access over time. However, none of them reached the status of an official project or really wide audience.

Some of the Gentoo projects also have their own repositories in which they work along with users. For example, this is the workflow used by [[Project:Science|the Science project]] (in [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/sci.git/ sci] repository).

== Resources of the Sunrise project ==

The [https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/sunrise.git/ Sunrise project repository] is kept open for use of users and developers. It still holds a few packages that are not in Gentoo. However, please note that those packages are usually outdated and may not work at all. The ebuilds mostly serve as a base for users who wish to take them over and maintain their own versions.

There is also some left-over documentation. However, note that some of it is outdated and/or describes Sunrise-specific practices and policies that are not uniformly agreed upon by Gentoo developers. The documentation includes:

* [[Sunrise/FAQ|FAQ]].
* [[Sunrise/How_to_commit|How to commit]] guide.
* [[Sunrise/Coding_standards|Coding standards]].
* [[Sunrise/Proxy_maintainer|Proxy maintainer]] guide.
* [[Sunrise/Common errors]]
* [[Sunrise/Reviewing]]
