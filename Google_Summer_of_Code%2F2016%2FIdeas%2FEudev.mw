<!-- Description goes here: --> 
[https://github.com/gentoo/eudev Eudev] is a standalone dynamic and persistent device naming support (aka userspace devfs) daemon that runs independently from the init system.    Eudev strives to remain init system and linux distribution neutral.  It is currently used as the devfs manager for more than a dozen different linux distros.  This project would be to fully document it's API's, and perform an audit on all the existing tests.  Create additional tests in areas of code not currently or inadequately covered.  Work to resolve any outstanding bugs.  Extend any of it's utility scripts as needed to further enhance it's ease of use and compatibility with hardware and software.
