'''udisks''' is a [[D-Bus]] daemon offering some storage related services:
* enumeration of storage devices, much like [[udev]] but with more details.
* [[mount]]ing of filesystems.
* [[partition]] of storage devices.
* [[smartmontools|monitor]] of storage devices.
* [[hdparm|configuration]] of storage devices.

== Installation ==

=== Prerequisites ===
Udisks uses [[D-Bus]] and [[polkit]], so set them up first.

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel|udisks1|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    < > ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support (DEPRECATED)  --->
    [*] USB support  --->
        <*>   Support for Host-side USB
        [*]     USB runtime power management (autosuspend) and wakeup
File Systems -->
    Native Language Support -->
        <*> NLS UTF8
</pre>}}

{{Kernel|udisks2|<pre>
General setup  --->
    [*] Support for paging of anonymous memory (swap)
Device Drivers  --->
    < > ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support (DEPRECATED)  --->
File Systems -->
    Native Language Support -->
        <*> NLS UTF8
    Pseudo filesystems  --->
        -*- Tmpfs virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
        [*]   Tmpfs POSIX Access Control Lists
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
Portage knows the global USE flag ''udisks'' for enabling support for udisks in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|sys-fs/udisks}} automatically (default for ''desktop'' [[profile]]s):
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
USE="... udisks ..."
</pre>}}
{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/udisks|desc=udisks1
|debug
|nls+yes
|remote-access
}}

{{USEflag|package=sys-fs/udisks|desc=udisks2
|cryptsetup
|debug
|gptfdisk+yes
|introspection+yes
|selinux
|systemd
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Addon software ==
* {{Package|sys-apps/gnome-disk-utility}} - [[GNOME]] program to partition, configure and monitor storage devices.
* {{Package|sys-fs/udiskie}} - Automatic mount of drives.
* {{Package|sys-fs/udisks-glue}} - Run actions on udisks events.

== Configuration ==
Udisks uses [[polkit]] to handle permissions.

== Usage ==
Some useful commands are:
* '''udisks --enumerate''' - Lists all storage devices.
* '''udisks --monitor''' - Monitor udisks.
* '''udisks --monitor-details''' - Monitor udisks with more details.
* '''udisks --inhibit-polling /dev/DEVICEFILE''' - Disable polling on the given device.
In some cases the '''udisks''' command is not found. If this is the case, try '''udisksctl''' 
(Will have different command options from udisks)


=== Python Scripting ===
The following code is an example of listening to udisk on the system dbus for device events.  We stick with udisk1 and
glib style event loops in order for the code to also be able to run on a RedHat or Centos system.  Otherwise, we could use the udisk2 monitor api to just look at mount events.

The relevant udisk documentation url for 1.0.5 (Rhel6 is at 1.0.1) is [http://udisks.freedesktop.org/docs/1.0.5/Device.html here]

====USB Thumb Drive Example====
The following example is from a gentoo system when an 8gb thumb drive containing kubuntu 14.04 installer is plugged into a usb port.  It was created by dd'ing the iso file directly to the thumb drive.  fdisk shows that the 1gb or so of good stuff ended up in /dev/sdf2 while /dev/sdf1 is the free space left over.  Note that the first event is the "whole drive" or partition table getting looked at.

This happens when the device notifier pops up and we have kde open the drive in the dolphin file manager.

All this happens when we do a "safely remove" in dolphin.  Notice that some of the properties are already unset and we are catching exceptions in device_dump during examination

{{Code||<pre>
---changed---
DeviceFile:/dev/sdg1
NativePath: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:13.2/usb2/2-4/2-4:1.0/host46/target46:0:0/46:0:0:0/block/sdg/sdg1

DeviceIsPartition is not set
DeviceIsRemovable is not set
---removed---
/org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdg1
DeviceFile is unset

DeviceIsMounted is unset
DeviceIsMediaAvailable is not set
DeviceIsPartitionTable is not set
DeviceIsPartition is not set
DeviceIsRemovable is not set
---removed---
/org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdg2
DeviceFile is unset
NativePath: is unset
DeviceIsMounted is unset
DeviceIsMediaAvailable is not set
DeviceIsPartitionTable is not set
DeviceIsPartition is not set
DeviceIsRemovable is not set
---changed---

unmounted
media not available
device is removable
---changed---
DeviceFile:/dev/sdg
NativePath: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:13.2/usb2/2-4/2-4:1.0/host46/target46:0:0/46:0:0:0/block/sdg
unmounted

---changed---

NativePath: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:13.2/usb2/2-4/2-4:1.0/host46/target46:0:0/46:0:0:0/block/sdg
unmounted
media not available
device is removable
</pre>}}


Then we get one last removal signal when we yank the thumb drive

{{Code||<pre>
---removed---
/org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdg
DeviceFile is unset
NativePath: is unset
DeviceIsMounted is unset
DeviceIsMediaAvailable is not set
DeviceIsPartitionTable is not set
DeviceIsPartition is not set
DeviceIsRemovable is not set
</pre>}}


====CD/DVD media example====
The use of a dvd or cdrom in an internal drive will cause only changes events to signal.  Here's an example for a mount followed by an unmount of a gentoo autobuild iso in a Centos6 VM's virtual cdrom.  Notice that there are two change signals per action.  The insertion shows the first event with media available and then a second event on the mount where the DeviceMountedByUid value properly matched up with our uid.  Presumably the two for the removal are the unmount followed by an eject, but media shows as not being available on both so the two are indistinguishable.

{{Note|DeviceIsMountedByUid appears to be useful for the uid put on the mounted disk in RHEL/Centos6 at least for the default gnome session (Gnome 2.28).  However it reports as mounted by root on gentoo when the KDE desktop device notifier pops up and is used to mount, presumably because it's devicekit/policykit getting involved.  We need to look at the /proc/mounts for the DeviceFile string instead to find the uid in the mount options.}}
