<!--T:1-->
The '''Gentoo Linux Security Advisories''' ('''GLSA''') are notifications generated by Gentoo's security team about vulnerable software in the Gentoo Portage tree. These reports contain information about the vulnerability itself, the possible impact on a Gentoo system, references towards external sources (like CVE information) as well as information on how to resolve the vulnerability (which, in most cases, is an update or upgrade of one or more software titles).

<!--T:2-->
GLSA notifications are managed as XML files within the Portage tree (see {{Path|${PORTDIR}/metadata/glsa}}). A user can run the {{c|glsa-check}} application to have its system verified against these GLSA notifications and, optionally, update the necessary packages automatically to remediate the vulnerability.
