Recently it has become possible to watch Netflix on Linux and FreeBSD via [[Wine]] with good performance.

==Prequisites==

===xattr===
File system extended attributes are used to keep the precious DRM working, so you’ll potentially need to add support in your kernel as well as having your file system mounted explicitly with the option.

====Checking for support====
{{cmd|<nowiki>touch ~/.xattr_test && setfattr -n 'user.testAttr' -v 'attribute value' ~/.xattr_test &> /dev/null; getfattr ~/.xattr_test 2>&1 | grep -q user.testAttr && echo 'It works!' || echo 'No workie!'; rm ~/.xattr_test &> /dev/null</nowiki>}}

====Adding support====

In recent kernel versions there doesn’t appear to be an option for ext4 extended attributes, presumably meaning they’re always on already.

{{kernel||<pre style="font-size: inherit;">File systems  --->
    Ext3 journalling file system support
[*]     Ext3 extended attributes
    The Extended 4 (ext4) filesystem
[*]     Ext4 extended attributes</pre>}}

See [[Kernel/Upgrade]] for in-depth kernel rebuild instructions.

{{file|/etc/fstab||<pre style="font-size: inherit;"># <fs>			<mountpoint>	<type>		<opts>		<dump/pass>
/dev/sda3		/		ext4		user_xattr	0 1</pre>}}

If you were only missing the option in <code>/etc/fstab</code>:
{{rootCmd|mount / -o remount}}

==Installation==

Initially, pipelight is only keyworded on ~amd64. Stable users will need to keyword it. Otherwise, it is a simple emerge command:

{{rootCmd|emerge www-plugins/pipelight}}

==Initialization==

After the installation just initialize the plugin(s) you want to use. To use Netflix you have to enable Silverlight.

{{Cmd
|/usr/bin/pipelight-plugin --enable silverlight
|/usr/bin/pipelight-plugin --enable flash}}

Press Y to accept the plugin license. Then run Firefox (or your chosen web browser) from the Terminal to check if the plugin will run, i.e. for firefox-bin:

{{Cmd|firefox-bin}}

and watch the startup in the terminal for any errors. The plugin installation either starts immediately, or when visiting about:plugins in your webbrowser. If there are some errors please check again that you really installed Wine and Pipelight according to this page, if not then proceed with the following steps.

===Microsoft Corefonts (optional)===

For Wine-Compholio < 1.7.14 this step was required such that Silverlight works properly (see this [https://answers.launchpad.net/pipelight/+faq/2441 FAQ entry]). With Wine-Compholio 1.7.14 or greater the patchset already includes a [https://github.com/compholio/wine-compholio-daily/tree/master/patches/10-Missing_Fonts Arial replacement font], which seems to be sufficient for the Silverlight plugin.

To install the Corefonts you have to use Winetricks. Just download the Winetricks script (for example to your home directory):
{{Cmd|wget http://winetricks.org/winetricks}}

Mark it as executable:
{{Cmd|chmod +x winetricks}}

Then run it:
{{Cmd| WINEPREFIX{{=}}$HOME/.wine-pipelight ./winetricks}}

Then select "Select the default wineprefix" -> "Install a font" -> "corefonts" and click "Okay".

===Netflix===
Install an extension listed at http://answers.launchpad.net/pipelight/+faq/2351 such as http://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/uacontrol/ and configure a Windows UA string, such as this one:[http://answers.launchpad.net/pipelight/+faq/2351 *]
<pre>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:15.0) Gecko/20120427 Firefox/15.0a1</pre>

Enjoy improved Netflix.

==Troubleshooting==
*Try different UA strings
*(Re)Move <code>~/.wine-pipelight</code>
*(Re)Move <code>pluginreg.dat</code> from <code>~/.mozilla</code> (<code>find ~/.mozilla/ -name 'pluginreg.dat'</code>)
*Check paths & other variables in <code>~/.config/pipelight-silverlight5.1</code> (or if nonexistant, <code>/usr/share/pipelight/configs/pipelight-silverlight5.1</code>)
{{rootCmd|eselect opengl list}}
{{rootCmd|eselect opengl set #}}

=== Audio ===
If you use Pulseaudio but find that wine32 is trying to load 64-bit pulseaudio drivers, consider the solution found in this [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7060060.html here]
