== Creating a user domain ==

In this tutorial the focus is on creating a user domain. By default, SELinux on Gentoo comes with a number of SELinux users and roles, but more can be added to tailor the SELinux permissions to the purpose of the system. In this tutorial, a mail administrator user will be created that has administrative rights on the Postfix infrastructure.

=== Creating the user module ===

The first step is to create a user module, in this case {{Path|mailadm.te}}. This module will contain the permissions to be granted to the user:

{{FileBox|filename=mailadm.te|1=<pre>
policy_module(mailadm, 1.0)

role mailadm_r;

userdom_login_user_template(mailadm)

postfix_admin(mailadm_t, mailadm_r)
</pre>}}

Build and load the module and verify that the user domain and role now exists:

{{RootCmd|make mailadm.pp|output=<pre>
Compiling mcs mailadm module
/usr/bin/checkmodule:  loading policy configuration from tmp/mailadm.tmp
/usr/bin/checkmodule:  policy configuration loaded
/usr/bin/checkmodule:  writing binary representation (version 17) to tmp/mailadm.mod
Creating mcs mailadm.pp policy package
rm tmp/mailadm.mod.fc tmp/mailadm.mod
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|seinfo -rmailadm_r|output=<pre>
  mailadm_r
</pre>}}

{{RootCmd|seinfo -tmailadm_t|output=<pre>
  mailadm_t
</pre>}}

=== Update context and type information ===

Before assigning the new user domain to a real Linux account, it is important to first configure SELinux contexts and types for it.

The first file we need to update is {{Path|/etc/selinux/mcs/contexts/default_type}} (substitute ''mcs'' with the policy store name that is active on the system). In it, SELinux is told what the default type is when a role is selected. In this case, when <tt>mailadm_r</tt> is selected, <tt>mailadm_t</tt> should be the default type:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/selinux/mcs/contexts/default_type|1=<pre>
auditadm_r:auditadm_t
mailadm_r:mailadm_t
secadm_r:secadm_t
sysadm_r:sysadm_t
staff_r:staff_t
unconfined_r:unconfined_t
user_r:user_t
</pre>}}

The second file is one to create inside {{Path|/etc/selinux/mcs/contexts/users}}. The simplest method is to copy an existing user file (this is for SELinux users) and modify it for the new role.

{{RootCmd|sed -e 's{{!}}user{{!}}mailadm{{!}}g' user_u > mailadm_u}}

=== Assign mailadm to the right Linux account ===

Finally, assign the newly created role to a Linux account.

First, create a SELinux user on which the role and type are mapped. This user is <tt>mailadm_u</tt> (which is also the name of the file created in {{Path|/etc/selinux/mcs/contexts/users}} previously.

{{RootCmd|semanage user -a -R "mailadm_r system_r"}}

Next, map this user to the Linux account. For instance, if the Linux account is <tt>user1234</tt> then this is accomplished like so:

{{RootCmd|semanage login -a -s mailadm_u user1234}}

Finally, reset the contexts of this users' home directory:

{{RootCmd|restorecon -RvF /home/user1234}}

=== What to remember ===

Creating a SELinux user is a matter of the following simple steps:
# Create the module which adds in the rights
# Create the SELinux user which is allowed the role(s) previously created
# Update the SELinux contexts to recognize the new user
# Map the Linux account(s) to the new SELinux user
