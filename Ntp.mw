'''NTP''' ('''N'''etwork '''T'''ime '''P'''rotocol) is used to synchronize the [[system time]] with other devices over the network, this usually happens in a client-server model.

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|net-misc/ntp}}:
{{USEflag
|package=net-misc/ntp
|caps
|debug++no
|ipv6+yes
|openntpd
|parse-clocks
|samba
|selinux
|snmp
|ssl+yes
|vim-syntax
|zeroconf
}}

{{Emerge|ntp}}

Or alternatively, you can use {{Package|net-misc/openntpd}} instead.

== Configuration ==
The only configuration file is {{Path|/etc/ntp.conf}} which is well explained with comments. Here are some of the more important settings.

=== Server ===
Here you can specify with which servers you want to synchronize your local time.
{{File|/etc/ntp.conf||<pre>
server 0.gentoo.pool.ntp.org
server 1.gentoo.pool.ntp.org
server 2.gentoo.pool.ntp.org
server 3.gentoo.pool.ntp.org
</pre>}}
{{Note|Time zones and location of the server do not matter, it synchronizes the [[Wikipedia:Coordinated Universal Time|UTC time]].}}

Per default the gentoo servers are listed and enabled. A list of available servers can be found here: [http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/#top ntp.org] You can also define a home or company server here, given that ntpd is running and the machine is allowed to.

=== Permissions ===
To control who is allowed to synchronize with this machine and change the configuration, you can change these options.

* access to NTP service allowed only from localhost.
{{File|/etc/ntp.conf||<pre>
# To deny other machines from changing the
# configuration but allow localhost:
restrict default nomodify nopeer
restrict 127.0.0.1
</pre>}}

* access to NTP service allowed only from the 192.168.0.0/24 network.
{{File|/etc/ntp.conf||<pre>
# To allow machines within your network to synchronize
# their clocks with your server, but ensure they are
# not allowed to configure the server or used as peers
# to synchronize against, uncomment this line.
#
restrict 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify nopeer notrap
</pre>}}

== Usage ==
Basic tools and common usage

=== Client ===
==== Ntp-Client ====
{{RootCmd|rc-service ntp-client start}}

To monitor status of the client.

{{RootCmd|rc-service ntp-client status}}

If ntpd is run as a service, the time will automatically synchronize as long as the difference between the local time and the time on the server is less than 1000s (~17min). So it is pretty common to adjust the time initially to whatever the server time is as a trusted source:
{{RootCmd|ntpd -g -c /etc/ntp.conf}}
{{Note|If ntpd is already running, it won't start a second time.}}

==== Ntpdate ====
This used to be the client, but its functionality is now moved into ntpd itself. It is purely to set the local time when started and then exits (not a service):
{{RootCmd|ntpdate pool.ntp.org}}

=== Server ===
==== Ntpd Service ====
Add ntpd to the default runlevel to have the time synchronized automatically.  There is no need to run a client when the service is running.  Make sure you are not running ntp-client or ntpdate.

{{RootCmd
|rc-service ntpd start
|rc-update add ntpd default}}

To monitor status of the server.

{{RootCmd|rc-service ntpd status}}
