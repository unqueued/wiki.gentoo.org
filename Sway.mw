'''Sway''' (contracted from '''S'''irCmpwn's '''Way'''land compositor) is [[Article description::an open-source [[Wayland compositor]] that is designed to be compatible with the [[i3]] window manager.]]

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=dev-libs/sway}}

=== Emerge ===

Install {{package|dev-libs/sway}} with:

{{Emerge|dev-libs/sway}}

== Configuration ==

To view all available configuration options:

{{Cmd|man 5 sway}}

=== Files ===

Each user running sway can edit the default configuration file in order to run a customized sway session. Gentoo stores this file at its default {{Path|/etc/sway/config}} location:

{{Cmd
|mkdir -p ~/.config/sway/
|cp /etc/sway/config ~/.config/sway/
}}

=== Terminal emulator ===

By default the sway configuration file uses the {{c|urxvt}} terminal emulator (found in the {{Package|x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}} package). It is a good idea to emerge this terminal emulator so that a terminal will be available once sway is running:

{{Emerge|x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}}

=== HiDPI ===

To adjust sway's rendering for HiDPI displays (4K and above), the name of the display to be adjusted must be obtained. After a sway session is running, issue the following:

{{Cmd|swaymsg -t get_outputs}}

{{Note|The <code>swaymsg</code> USE flag must be enabled for the {{c|swaymsg}} command to be available on the system.}}

The <code>output</code> statement in the sway configuration file will accept a <code>scale</code> parameter to adjust the scaling of the high resolution display.

== Usage ==

All most key combos will be defined in the {{Path|~/.config/sway/config}} configuration file.

The 'logo' key is defined as the <code>$mod</code> value by default. On most keyboards this will be the Windows key.

=== Movement ===

Sway has a Vi-like interface. {{Key|h}} (left), {{Key|j}} (down), {{Key|k}} (up), and {{Key|l}} (right) can be used for movement.

See {{c|man 5 sway-input}} for more information.

=== Terminal ===

The default key-combo to open a terminal emulator is {{Key|$mod}}+{{Key|Enter}}.

== Troubleshooting ==
{{Note| Work In Progress}}

* Cn.c:67] swaybg requires the compositor to support the desktop-shell extension.urity rules for processes running as other users.
