'''Sway''' (contracted from '''S'''irCmpwn's '''Way'''land compositor) is [[Article description::an open-source [[Wayland compositor]] that is designed to be compatible with the [[i3]] window manager.]]

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=dev-libs/sway}}

=== Emerge ===

{{Emerge|dev-libs/sway}}

== Configuration ==

To view all available configuration options:

{{Cmd|man 5 sway}}

=== Files ===

Each user running sway can edit the default configuration file in order to run a customized sway session. Gentoo stores this file at its default {{Path|/etc/sway/config}} location:

{{Cmd
|mkdir -p ~/.config/sway/
|cp /etc/sway/config ~/.config/sway/
}}

=== Terminal emulator ===

By default the sway configuration file uses the [[urxvt]] terminal emulator (found in the {{Package|x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}} package). It is a good idea to emerge this terminal emulator so that a terminal will be available once sway is running:

{{Emerge|x11-terms/rxvt-unicode}}

Another popular choice is {{Package|x11-terms/kitty}} which works natively with Wayland if the <code>KITTY_ENABLE_WAYLAND</code> environment variable is set to <code>1</code>.

=== HiDPI ===

To adjust sway's rendering for HiDPI displays (4K and above), the name of the display to be adjusted must be obtained. After a sway session is running, issue the following:

{{Cmd|swaymsg -t get_outputs}}

{{Note|The <code>swaymsg</code> USE flag must be enabled for the {{c|swaymsg}} command to be available on the system.}}

The <code>output</code> statement in the sway configuration file will accept a <code>scale</code> parameter to adjust the scaling of the high resolution display.

=== Executing sway ===

==== OpenRC ====

If using [[ConsoleKit]] (OpenRC), run Sway using:

{{Cmd|exec ck-launch-session sway}}

==== systemd ====

When using [[Systemd]] or [[Elogind]] Sway can be launched with:

{{Cmd|sway}}

==== Other ====

Systems that are configured with neither systemd, elogind, nor ConsoleKit, will need to create a bash script (or use some other means) to set the <var>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</var> variable.

{{Note|The instructions below must be followed only if the environment does not define the <var>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</var> variable (this is usually the case, if systemd/elogind/consolekit are not used).}}

The environment variable can be defined in the usual configuration files. For example, if {{U|Larry}} sets <var>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</var> variable in his [[Bash]] shell's configuration file and he has chosen that the directory will be in {{Path|/tmp}}.

{{FileBox|title=Set the <var>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</var> variable|filename=/home/larry/.bash_profile|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/bash
if test -z "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/${UID}-runtime-dir
    if ! test -d "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
        mkdir "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
        chmod 0700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
    fi
fi
}}

With the <var>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</var> defined, sway can be launched as usual:

{{Cmd|sway}}

If issues are encountered check [https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues Sway issues on GitHub] before contacting the Sway community on IRC ({{IRC|sway|mode=webchat}}) or opening a [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ new Gentoo bug].

== Usage ==

All key combinations will be defined in the {{Path|~/.config/sway/config}} configuration file.

The 'logo' key is defined as the <code>$mod</code> value by default. On most keyboards this will be the Windows key.

=== Movement ===

Sway has a Vi-like interface. {{Key|h}} (left), {{Key|j}} (down), {{Key|k}} (up), and {{Key|l}} (right) can be used for movement.

See {{c|man 5 sway-input}} for more information.

=== Terminal ===

The default key combination to open a terminal emulator is {{Key|$mod}}+{{Key|Enter}}.
