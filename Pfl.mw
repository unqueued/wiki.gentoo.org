'''P'''ortage '''F'''ile '''L'''ist ('''PFL''') can be [[Article description::used to search for files (or strings) provided by packages that are not yet installed]], and optionally installs a little cronjob to update the database on the internet with the information that is available to be queried.

== Installation ==

=== USE flags ===

{{USEflag|package=app-portage/pfl}}

=== Emerge ===

You can install {{Package|app-portage/pfl}} with the following command:

{{Emerge|app-portage/pfl}}

== Usage ==

The database can be used online to search for files installed by ebuilds. Lets say you want to run {{c|glxgears}} but it isn't installed. Recently the program was removed from {{Package|media-libs/mesa}} itself, so you could search for {{c|glxgears}} online to find the related package: [http://www.portagefilelist.de/site/query/file search online]

{{Cmd|e-file udev}}

=== Search time comparison with equery ===

PFL is much quicker to search files (even if not installed locally), while {{c|equery}} is more powerful and gives more options to search.
