This package installs a little cronjob to update a database on the internet with information about files installed on the sytem (once a week). 

== Installation ==
You can install {{Package|app-portage/pfl}} with the following command:
{{Emerge|app-portage/pfl}}

=== USE Flags ===
{{USEflag
|package=app-portage/pfl
|network-cron+yes+yes+
}}

== Usage ==
The database can be used online to search for files installed by ebuilds. Lets say you want to run ''glxgears'' but it isn't installed. Recently the program was removed from ''mesa'' itself, so you could search for glxgears online to find the related package: [http://www.portagefilelist.de/site/query/file search online]
