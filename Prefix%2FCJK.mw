Prefix is mostly an independent system from the host. Therefore it's possible to get full CJK features within Prefix despite of the host.

In this guide, a solution of {{Package|app-emacs/scim-bridge-el}} in {{Package|app-editors/emacs}} running on {{Package|x11-wm/xpra}} is given.

== The Remote X server ==

{{Package|x11-wm/xpra}} is the "screen for X", it allows you to run X programs, usually on a remote host and direct their display to your local machine.

Install it,
{{Emerge|x11-wm/xpra}}

Next, install standard X and CJK fonts.
{{Emerge|media-fonts/font-misc-misc media-fonts/efont-unicode media-fonts/wqy-bitmapfont media-fonts/font-adobe-75dpi media-fonts/font-adobe-100dpi}}

{{Note|The fonts listed here are only a suggestion. Feel free to compile your own list.}}

=== Setup Fonts for Xpra ===

Tell Xpra to use Xorg instead of Xvfb.

{{File|${EPREFIX}/etc/xpra/xpra.conf||<pre>
...
xvfb=Xorg -dpi 96 -noreset -nolisten tcp +extension GLX +extension RANDR +extension RENDER -logfile ${HOME}/.xpra/Xorg.${DISPLAY}.log -config /home/benda/gnto/etc/xpra/xorg.conf
...
</pre>}}

Replace /home/benda/gnto with your own EPREFIX.

Fonts from the host can be used, too. Just the location of the fonts needs to be told to the Xorg of Xpra.

{{File|${EPREFIX}/etc/xpra/xorg.conf||<pre>
FontPath "/home/benda/gnto/usr/share/fonts/wqy-bitmapfont"
FontPath "/usr/share/fonts/wqy-zenhei"
FontPath "catalogue:/etc/X11/fontpath.d"
</pre>}}

The wqy-bitmapfont and wqy-zenhei lines are quite straight forward, while the second line is special to a RHEL-like host.
