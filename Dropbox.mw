''Installation''

{{Emerge|{{Package|net-misc/dropbox}}}}

''Configuration''
----
Set the DROPBOX_USERS variable to your regular $USER name in ''/etc/conf.d/dropbox''.

Below is an example showing how to do so using the text editor ''ed(1)'':
{{CodeBox|1=
root# DBOXUSER=your_regular_user_name
root# ed /etc/conf.d/dropbox <<q
/DROPBOX_USERS/ s/".*"/"$DBOXUSER"/p
w
q
}}
Next, add the dropbox init script to the default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add dropbox default}}
Now, as a regular user run the command line shown below:
{{Cmd|dropbox start}}
Which will create these directories in your $HOME directory:

<tt>
Dropbox/
.dropbox-dist/
.dropbox/
</tt>

{{Note|The command line above will also launch the Dropbox login window. Enter your credentials, or register an account, and you are good to go.}}
{{Note|The instructions shown above will not result in a GUI launcher for Dropbox being integrated into your window manager or desktop environment, so it seems. At least, that was the case with XFCE4 in my experience. I ended up creating a Dropbox launcher by myself.}}
Here is how to do it. Download an icon to your liking from this URL, ''https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y30u5e1hnnqmv22/AADAMMM-gFutPWsm_tDDAR8ka/png?dl=0'', and copy it over to ''/opt/dropbox/images/hicolor/16x16/''.

Here is a screenshot of the the launcher properties window:
