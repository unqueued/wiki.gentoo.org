{{Emerge|{{Package|net-misc/dropbox}}}}

== Configuration ==

Set the <code>DROPBOX_USERS</code> variable to the regular user name in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/dropbox}}

Below is an example showing how to do so using the text editor <tt>ed</tt>:

{{CodeBox|1=
root# DBOXUSER=<user_name>
root# ed /etc/conf.d/dropbox <<q
/DROPBOX_USERS/ s/".*"/"$DBOXUSER"/p
w
q
}}

Next, add the Dropbox init script to the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add dropbox default}}

Now as a regular user run the command line shown below:

{{Cmd|dropbox start}}

Which will create these directories in the user's directory:

* {{Path|Dropbox/}}
* {{Path|.dropbox-dist/}}
* {{Path|.dropbox/}}

{{Note|The command line above will also launch the Dropbox login window. Enter credentials or register an existing account to finish up the installation.}}

{{Note|The instructions shown above will not result in a GUI launcher for Dropbox being integrated into the window manager or desktop environment, so it seems. At least, some users have reported with XFCE4. A Dropbox launcher may need to be created for each desktop environment.}}

=== Xfce ===

==== Launcher ====

To create a Dropbox launcher for Xfce, 

Download an icon from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y30u5e1hnnqmv22/AADAMMM-gFutPWsm_tDDAR8ka/png?dl=0 and copy it into the {{Path|/opt/dropbox/images/hicolor/16x16/}} directory.

Here is a screenshot of the the launcher properties window:

=== Init systems ===

==== Systemd ====

For <tt>systemd</tt> users: enable it, passing a username as the instance identifier:

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable dropbox@<user_name>}}

Be sure to replace <code><user_name></code> in the example above with an appropriate user name.

By default, service will not display a tray-icon because it does not know which display to use. To repair this edit service:

{{RootCmd|systemctl edit dropbox@<user_name>}}

{{CodeBox|title=Adding display for DropBox|1=
[Service]
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
}}
