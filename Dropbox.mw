Below are instructions I followed to set up Dropbox on my system.

''Installation''
----
{{Emerge|{{Package|net-misc/dropbox}}}}

''Configuration''
----
Set the DROPBOX_USERS variable to the value of your regular $USER in ''/etc/conf.d/dropbox''.

Below is an example showing how to do so using the text editor ''ed(1)'':
{{Code||<pre>
root# DBOXUSER=your_regular_user_ID
root# ed /etc/conf.d/dropbox <<q
/DROPBOX_USERS/ s/".*"/"$DBOXUSER"/p
w
q
</pre>}}
Next, add the dropbox init script to the default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add dropbox default}}
Now, as a regular user run the command line shown below, which will create these directories in your $HOME directory:

<tt>
Dropbox/
.dropbox-dist/
.dropbox/
</tt>
{{Cmd|dropbox start}}
{{Note|The command line above will also launch the Dropbox login window. Enter your credentials, or register an account, and you are good to go.}}
{{Note|The instructions shown above will not result in a GUI launcher for Dropbox being integrated into your window manager or desktop environment, so it seems. At least, that was the case with XFCE4 in my experience. I ended up creating a Dropbox launcher by myself.}}
I downloaded this PNG, ''https://www.dropbox.com/s/hi2dcyswjhcj5yr/dropbox-linux.png'', and saved it in ''/opt/dropbox/images/hicolor/16x16/''.

Here is a screenshot of the launcher I ended up creating:
